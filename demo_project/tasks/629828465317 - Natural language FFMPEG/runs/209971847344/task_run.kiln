    "output": "To extract audio track 5 and combine it with the video from input.mov, you need to use stream mapping with the -map parameter to specify which streams to include in the output.\n\nThe -map parameter allows you to select specific streams from the input file. For video, stream 0 is typically the first video stream, and for audio, you'll want to map the specific audio track you need.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:5 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nIn this command:\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:5` selects the 6th audio stream (audio track 5, since indexing starts at 0) from input 0  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\nNote: I'm assuming the audio tracks are indexed starting from 0, so audio track 5 would actually be the 6th audio stream in the file. If you meant the literal 5th audio stream (index 4), use `-map 0:a:4` instead.",
