    "output": "To extract audio from input.mkv and save it as an MP3 file, you can use FFmpeg to copy or transcode the audio stream. Since MKV files often contain audio codecs other than MP3, explicit transcoding to MP3 is recommended for compatibility.\n\nHereâ€™s how you can extract the audio as MP3 efficiently:\n\n- -i input.mkv specifies the input file.\n- -vn disables video processing (saves resources, which is best practice for large files).\n- -acodec libmp3lame chooses the MP3 codec.\n- -q:a 2 sets audio quality (VBR, 0=best, 9=worst; 2 is considered near-transparent for most uses).\n- output.mp3 is the output file.\n\nThis command is suitable for large files, as it avoids unnecessary processing and outputs high-quality MP3.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vn -acodec libmp3lame -q:a 2 output.mp3\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The MKV file has a single (or manageable number of) audio stream(s).\n- You want the default (first) audio track extracted.\n- The output MP3 should be of good quality and compatible with most players.",
