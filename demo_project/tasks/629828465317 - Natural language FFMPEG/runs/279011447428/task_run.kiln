    "output": "To enhance vocal clarity in your recording, you can use several ffmpeg audio filters:\n\n- Use the highpass and lowpass filters to focus on the typical frequency range of the human voice (about 80 Hz to 12 kHz).\n- Apply the compand (compressor/expander) filter to even out levels and reduce noise.\n- Optionally, use dynaudnorm (dynamic audio normalization) to further even out loudness.\n- Use the volume filter to slightly increase overall loudness if needed.\n\nHereâ€™s a command which applies these steps; it assumes your input is a mono or stereo recording with the voice as the main content.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.m4a -af \"highpass=f=80, lowpass=f=12000, compand=attacks=0:decays=0:points=-80/-900|-40/-40|-20/-10|0/0, dynaudnorm, volume=2.0\" output_enhanced.m4a\n```\n\n**Explanation of filters used:**\n- `highpass=f=80`: Cuts low frequencies below 80 Hz (removes rumble).\n- `lowpass=f=12000`: Cuts high frequencies above 12 kHz (removes hiss).\n- `compand`: Compresses dynamic range, making quiet parts louder and loud parts softer for clarity.\n- `dynaudnorm`: Normalizes loudness dynamically, evening out volume.\n- `volume=2.0`: Boosts output volume by 2x (adjust as needed).\n\nYou can tweak the parameters for your specific voice and recording for best results.",
