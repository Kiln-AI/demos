    "output": "When running a bulk conversion from .wav to .ogg, a typical approach is to loop through all wav files, convert each one, then delete the source wav file after successful conversion. However, since your request includes removing the .wav sources, the command will delete files, which is a destructive operation.\n\nHere's an example command line that does this using a bash for-loop:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.wav; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.wav}.ogg\" && rm \"$f\"\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The for loop iterates over every .wav file in the current directory.\n- `ffmpeg -i \"$f\" \"${f%.wav}.ogg\"` converts the wav file to ogg.\n- `&& rm \"$f\"` deletes the original wav file only if the conversion was successful (ffmpeg returns exit status 0).\n\nPlease be cautious with this, as it will permanently delete your original files after conversion. You might want to back them up before running this command.",
