    "output": "To convert all .avi files in the folder to mp4 and then delete the .avi files, you typically would run a loop that converts each file and then deletes the original. However, this involves deleting files, which is a destructive operation. \n\nHere is an example command line (using bash) that does both conversion and deletion:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.avi; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac \"${f%.avi}.mp4\" && rm \"$f\"; done\n```\n\nThis loops over each .avi file, converts to .mp4 with H.264 and AAC, then removes the original .avi after successful conversion.\n\nBut note, this deletes your source files, which is destructive. Be very sure you want to do this.",
