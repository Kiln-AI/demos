    "output": "To increase the volume of your podcast by 3 dB in ffmpeg while avoiding clipping, use the `volume` audio filter. The `volume` filter lets you specify an increase in decibels (dB). Boosting by 3 dB multiplies the amplitude by about 1.414. It’s also good practice to use the `-af \"volume=3dB\"` form for clarity.\n\nTo prevent clipping (distortion caused by exceeding the maximum allowable amplitude), ffmpeg’s `volume` filter alone does not apply limiting or normalization. If your file is already peaking near 0 dBFS, boosting volume can cause clipping. For safety, consider using a limiter filter after the volume boost; the `alimiter` filter will ensure no samples exceed 0 dBFS.\n\nExample command with both volume increase and a limiter for safety:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i episode.mp3 -af \"volume=3dB,alimiter=limit=0dB\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k episode_louder.mp3\n```\n\n- `volume=3dB` increases volume by 3 decibels.\n- `alimiter=limit=0dB` ensures the signal does not exceed digital full scale (prevents clipping).\n- `-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k` re-encodes to MP3 at 192 kbps, a common high-quality bitrate.\n\nAssumption: Your MP3 can be re-encoded (as lossless adjustment is not supported for MP3), and you want to stay in the MP3 format. Adjust `-b:a` as needed.",
