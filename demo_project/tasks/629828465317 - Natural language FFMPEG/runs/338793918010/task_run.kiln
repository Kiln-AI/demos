    "output": "To copy audio and video streams from input.mkv to output.mp4 without re-encoding, you can use stream copying with the `-c copy` option. This method remuxes the streams into MP4 container format quickly while preserving original quality since no transcoding occurs.\n\nHowever, note that not all codecs supported in MKV are compatible with MP4 container. For example, some audio codecs or subtitles may not be supported in MP4. If the input streams are compatible (commonly H.264 video and AAC audio), this command works perfectly.\n\nThe `-movflags +faststart` option moves the MP4 metadata to the beginning of the file, allowing the video to start playing before the entire file is downloaded (important for streaming).\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis is the fastest way to remux streams as it avoids decoding and encoding, keeping the quality intact. If your streams are incompatible with MP4, you may need to re-encode those specific streams.",
