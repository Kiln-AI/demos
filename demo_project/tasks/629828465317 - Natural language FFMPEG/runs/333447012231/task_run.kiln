    "output": "To batch resize all MOV files in a folder to have a width of 720 pixels while keeping their aspect ratio, you can use a shell loop combined with `ffmpeg`. The key is to set the width to 720 and the height to -2 with the `-vf scale` filter, which tells FFmpeg to automatically calculate the height to maintain the aspect ratio and ensures the height is divisible by 2 (a common codec requirement).\n\nHereâ€™s what this does:\n- `-vf scale=720:-2` sets width to 720 pixels and calculates the height automatically, rounded to be divisible by 2.\n- The script processes all `.mov` files in the folder.\n- Outputs resized files with a modified filename like `filename_720.mov` to avoid overwriting.\n- Uses libx264 codec and AAC for compatible, good-quality encoding.\n\nExample bash script:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mov; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vf scale=720:-2 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p \"${f%.mov}_720.mov\"\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n- `-c:v libx264`: Encode video with H.264 codec for good compression and compatibility.\n- `-preset slow`: Higher compression efficiency (use `fast` or `medium` for faster encoding).\n- `-crf 23`: Quality setting; lower means better quality (default sane tradeoff).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encode audio in AAC with 128 kbps bitrate.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures compatibility with most players and devices.\n\nMake sure you run this command in the folder where your MOV files reside, or adjust the path accordingly. This solution assumes you have a bash-like shell environment (Linux, macOS, or Windows with WSL or Git Bash).",
