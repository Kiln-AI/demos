    "output": "To enhance the bass in your recording.wav, you can use ffmpeg's built-in equalizer filter. The equalizer filter allows you to boost or cut frequencies by specifying frequency (f), width (w), and gain (g). For bass enhancement, targeting frequencies around 60-120 Hz with a positive gain is common.\n\nIn this example:\n- frequency=80 Hz (typical bass range center)\n- width_type=q and width=1.0 control the width/Q factor of the boost\n- gain=6 dB increases the bass at the target frequency\n\nThe filter is applied to all audio channels.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.wav -af \"equalizer=f=80:t=q:w=1:g=6\" enhanced_bass.wav\n```\n\nThis command reads your input, applies a +6dB boost at 80Hz with moderate width, and writes the result to enhanced_bass.wav. Adjust f (frequency), w (width), or g (gain) for stronger/weaker or broader/narrower bass enhancement as desired.",
