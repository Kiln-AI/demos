    "output": "To remove an unwanted audio track from an MKV file while keeping the main audio track intact, you should use stream copying to avoid re-encoding and preserve quality. First, identify which audio stream is the main one you want to keep (usually stream 0:1 or similar), then select that audio stream along with all other desired streams (like video and subtitles). The `-map` option specifies which streams to include, and `-c copy` performs stream copying.\n\nAssuming the first video stream (0:v:0) and the main audio stream (e.g., 0:a:0) are to be kept, and you want to discard other audio streams, the command looks like:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf you have subtitles or other data streams you want to keep, add them with additional `-map` options (e.g., `-map 0:s?` for subtitles if present).\n\nThis approach avoids re-encoding, retaining the original quality and speeds up processing. Make sure to confirm the stream indices with `ffprobe` or `ffmpeg -i input.mkv` before running.",
