    "output": "To extract only the subtitle stream from an MKV file as a .srt file, you can use stream copy mode with `ffmpeg` by specifying the subtitle stream and copying it without re-encoding. This is efficient and preserves the subtitle integrity.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-map 0:s:0` to select the first subtitle stream from the input (assuming the MKV has at least one subtitle stream).\n- Use `-c:s srt` to convert the subtitle stream to the SRT format if needed (for text-based subtitles).\n- If the subtitle stream is already in SRT format, stream copying `-c:s copy` is sufficient.\n- The output file extension `.srt` ensures the container format is right.\n- Use `-y` to overwrite the output file if it exists (optional).\n\nAssumption: The MKV file contains at least one subtitle stream and you want the first one extracted. If there are multiple subtitle streams or you want a specific language, the `-map` option can be adjusted accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:s:0 -c:s srt output.srt\n```",
