    "output": "To change the frame size of a video so that both width and height are divisible by 16, you can use the ffmpeg `scale` video filter with expressions that round the dimensions to the nearest multiple of 16. This is important for compatibility with many codecs and compression algorithms that work best with dimensions aligned to macroblocks (often 16x16 pixels).\n\nHereâ€™s how it works:\n- Use the scale filter with expressions like `floor(iw/16)*16` for width and `floor(ih/16)*16` for height, where `iw` and `ih` stand for input width and input height.\n- `floor()` rounds down to the nearest integer.\n- Multiplying by 16 ensures the result is divisible by 16.\n\nThis approach keeps the original aspect ratio close but slightly crops or reduces the frame size if needed to meet divisibility by 16.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=floor(iw/16)*16:floor(ih/16)*16\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf \"scale=floor(iw/16)*16:floor(ih/16)*16\"` scales the video dimensions to the nearest multiple of 16, rounding down.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- You can add other options like `-c:v` to encode with a specific codec or quality settings depending on your needs.\n\nIf you want to ensure the closest rounding instead of always down, you can use an expression with `round()`, but be cautious as it might increase size beyond original in some cases, which may not be supported or desired. The floor approach is safest for compatibility.",
