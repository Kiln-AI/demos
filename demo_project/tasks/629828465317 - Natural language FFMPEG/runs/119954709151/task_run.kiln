    "output": "To normalize the loudness of an audio file to -14 LUFS integrated, you can use ffmpeg's `loudnorm` filter. This filter performs EBU R128 loudness normalization, which is standard for broadcast and streaming loudness compliance.\n\nKey points of the command:\n- `loudnorm=I=-14:LRA=7:TP=-2` sets the integrated loudness target to -14 LUFS, loudness range (LRA) to 7 LU, and true peak (TP) limit to -2 dBTP, which helps prevent clipping.\n- Two-pass loudnorm normalization is recommended for accuracy, but for simplicity, a single pass can give a good result.\n- Output is written to `normalized.wav`.\n\nHere's a single-pass example command assuming a quick solution:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af loudnorm=I=-14:LRA=7:TP=-2 normalized.wav\n```\n\nFor more accuracy, a two-pass normalization can be used (analyze pass followed by a correction pass), but this is the basic approach for -14 LUFS normalization.",
