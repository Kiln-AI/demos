    "output": "To resize the video to a height of 720 while doubling the original width and maintaining the pixel aspect ratio, you can use the `scale` filter with expressions that refer to the input width (`iw`) and height (`ih`). Specifically:\n\n- `width=2*iw` doubles the original width.\n- `height=720` sets the height to 720 pixels.\n- Since the scaling is explicit, pixel aspect ratio will be preserved as the pixels are uniformly scaled.\n\nNote: Doubling the width without changing the pixel aspect ratio means the video will be stretched horizontally, which might distort the image. If you want to maintain the original display aspect ratio, you’d need a different approach. But following your instructions strictly, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i racecar.mkv -vf \"scale=2*iw:720\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-vf \"scale=2*iw:720\"` doubles the width and sets the height to 720 pixels.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Output file is named `output.mkv`.\n\nIf you want to ensure the output width is divisible by 2 (which is generally required by most codecs), use `width=2*iw+mod(2-2*iw\\,2\\,0)` or simply ensure your source width is even. However, in most cases for doubling width, this isn’t needed unless the original width is odd.",
