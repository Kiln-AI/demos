    "output": "To convert a 24fps video to 25fps for PAL compatibility, you need to speed up both video and audio by a factor of 25/24 (~4.1667%). This method preserves audio-video sync but results in slightly faster playback and a minor pitch increase in audio (as is standard for true PAL speed-up).\n\nTo achieve this:\n\n- Set the output frame rate to 25 fps: -r 25\n- Change the audio sample rate to maintain sync using atempo filter: atempo=25/24 (approximately 1.0417). Note that atempo only supports values between 0.5 and 2.0, so this works.\n- For best results, re-encode the audio and video streams.\n\nHereâ€™s how you do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input24fps.mp4 -vf \"setpts=PTS*24/25\" -r 25 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -filter:a \"atempo=1.0416667\" output25fps.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -vf \"setpts=PTS*24/25\": Speeds up the video by the required amount.\n- -r 25: Sets target output framerate.\n- -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18: High quality H.264 video encoding.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k: Encodes audio with good quality AAC.\n- -filter:a \"atempo=1.0416667\": Speeds up audio by 25/24 to match new frame rate and keep sync.\n\nAssumptions: \n- Input file is called input24fps.mp4; change as needed.\n- The encoder choices (libx264 and AAC) provide good browser and device compatibility.\n- Slight speedup/pitch increase is acceptable, as is common in PAL standards conversion.",
