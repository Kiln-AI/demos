    "output": "To normalize the audio levels of a video, you can use ffmpeg’s loudnorm filter, which applies EBU R128 loudness normalization. This raises the perceived volume uniformly and avoids clipping, resulting in more consistent audio levels throughout your video. The filter operates in two passes for precise normalization, but for simplicity, a single-pass (which is still effective for general use) example is given below.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is input.mp4.\n- You want to overwrite the audio while keeping the video stream unchanged.\n\nHere’s how you can normalize audio with ffmpeg:\n\n- -filter:a loudnorm applies EBU R128 normalization.\n- -c:v copy keeps the existing video stream intact.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k encodes the audio to a widely supported AAC codec at good quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -filter:a loudnorm -c:a aac -b:a 192k output_normalized.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need even more precise normalization, a true two-pass approach can be used, but for most cases, the above one-liner gives excellent, fast results for basic video conversion tasks.",
