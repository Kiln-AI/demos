    "output": "To combine two videos side by side, with one acting as an alpha-transparent overlay, you should:\n\n1. Place the base video on the left using the `hstack` filter.\n2. Overlay the alpha-transparent video (which must have an alpha channel, e.g., `mov`, `webm` with VP8/VP9, `png`-sequence, or similar) using the `overlay` filter, ensuring itâ€™s composited with transparency.\n3. Use `-filter_complex` for advanced filter chains.\n\nBelow is an example assuming `background.mp4` (no alpha, base layer) and `overlay.webm` (with alpha channel):\n\n- [0][1]hstack=inputs=2 merges videos side by side.\n- [stacked][1]overlay=shortest=1 merges the alpha-video over the stacked result. If overlay's alpha is not respected, ensure your format supports alpha and input is decoded appropriately.\n- -c:v supports `-c:v libvpx-vp9` for outputs with alpha, or `-c:v qtrle` for QuickTime (MOV), or use `-pix_fmt yuv420p` if you want to drop alpha for web playback.\n\n**Assumption:** Both videos are the same height. If not, scale them first. `overlay.webm` has alpha. Adjust filenames as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i background.mp4 -i overlay.webm -filter_complex \"[0][1]hstack=inputs=2[stacked];[stacked][1]overlay=shortest=1\" -c:v libvpx-vp9 -auto-alt-ref 0 -pix_fmt yuva420p output.webm\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- This stacks the two videos side by side and overlays the alpha-transparent video as needed.\n- For outputting with alpha, VP9 in WebM (`libvpx-vp9` with `yuva420p`) is a practical choice.\n- The filter chain ensures correct compositing and respects alpha if your source supports it.\n\n**Tips:**\n- Alpha in MP4 is not broadly supported; WebM or MOV is preferred.\n- If the overlay should go only on one side, crop it first or adjust the overlay position.\n- Both videos should have the same resolution/height for a clean hstack; use `scale` as needed.\n\nLet me know if you need scaling or special alignment!",
