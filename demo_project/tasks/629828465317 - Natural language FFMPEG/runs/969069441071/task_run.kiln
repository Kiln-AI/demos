    "output": "To add a cover art image into an MP4 or MKV file while remuxing (copying all existing streams without re-encoding), you can use stream copying with the `-c copy` option and specify the cover image as an additional input. Then, the image is attached as a cover or metadata stream depending on the container.\n\n**Key details:**\n\n- Use `-map` to include all input streams from the original media as well as the cover image.\n- For MKV, you can attach the image as a **video** stream with a `-disposition:v` flag or as an **attached picture** (`-disposition:v:1 attached_pic`).\n- For MP4, the cover art is typically added as an **attached picture** stream.\n- Use `-c copy` so that all streams, including audio/video, are copied without re-encoding.\n- For MP4, the cover image should generally be a JPEG or PNG.\n\n**Example for MKV:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -i cover.jpg -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -disposition:v:1 attached_pic output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-map 0` includes all streams of the original input.\n- `-map 1` adds the cover image as an extra stream.\n- `-disposition:v:1 attached_pic` marks the second video stream (the cover image) as an attached picture.\n- `-c copy` copies all streams.\n\n**Example for MP4:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i cover.jpg -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -disposition:v:1 attached_pic output.mp4\n```\n\nSame explanation applies here: attach the cover image as an attached picture stream.\n\n---\n\n**Assumptions**:\n\n- Input cover image is `cover.jpg`.\n- Input is already an MP4 or MKV file with streams you want to copy as-is.\n- You want to remux (no transcoding).\n- You want the cover art properly flagged for players to recognize it.\n\nThese commands will produce a remuxed file with embedded cover art without re-encoding the main streams.",
