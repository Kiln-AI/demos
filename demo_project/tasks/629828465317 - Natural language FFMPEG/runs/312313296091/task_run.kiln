    "output": "Certainly! Reducing the frame rate from 60fps to 30fps improves compatibility and reduces file size and playback resource needs. The -filter:v \"fps=30\" filter is used for precise frame rate conversion, which drops or duplicates frames as necessary. Hereâ€™s how you would do it while re-encoding the video with common web-compatible codecs:\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file is named input.mp4.\n- You want to preserve quality as much as possible and output to output_30fps.mp4.\n- Default codecs (libx264 for video, aac for audio) are used for compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v \"fps=30\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output_30fps.mp4\n```\n\n- -filter:v \"fps=30\" sets the frame rate to 30fps.\n- -c:v libx264 uses H.264 for broad compatibility.\n- -crf 23 balances quality and size (lower=better quality).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio to AAC at 128kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart helps with web streaming.\n\nThis command results in a 30fps, browser/device-friendly MP4. Change file names as needed.",
