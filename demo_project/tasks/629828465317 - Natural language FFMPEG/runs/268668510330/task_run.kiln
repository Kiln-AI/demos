    "output": "To reduce a videoâ€™s frame rate smoothly in FFmpeg while keeping the audio in sync and minimizing choppiness, use the fps filter. This filter drops or duplicates frames as needed to achieve the target frame rate, while keeping frame timing correct with the audio. Using a high-quality video codec and leaving audio untouched (copy mode) helps keep everything in sync.\n\nSuppose you want to reduce input.mp4 from its original frame rate to 24 fps and get output.mp4:\n\n- -vf \"fps=24\": Changes the output frame rate to 24 fps in a frame-accurate way.\n- -c:v libx264: Specifies H.264 as the video codec (modern, good quality/compression).\n- -preset medium -crf 23: Typical balance for speed and quality.\n- -c:a copy: Keeps original audio unchanged to guarantee sync.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"fps=24\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf your source had a variable frame rate or sync issues, you might want to consider re-encoding audio as well (-c:a aac) to prevent rare edge cases. But for most typical edits, using -c:a copy retains perfect a/v sync.",
