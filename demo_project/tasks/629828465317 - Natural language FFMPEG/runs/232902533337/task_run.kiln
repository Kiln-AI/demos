    "output": "To update the audio track in presentation.mp4 by replacing it with narration.wav, normally you'd copy the video stream and use the new audio stream, then overwrite the original file. However, this request requires saving over the original mp4, which is a destructive operation. But since the instructions request commands that are destructive (overwrite existing files), here is the command that overwrites the original file with updated audio:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i presentation.mp4 -i narration.wav -c:v copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 -shortest presentation.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i presentation.mp4` inputs the original video.\n- `-i narration.wav` inputs the new audio.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the video from the first input.\n- `-map 1:a:0` selects the audio from the second input.\n- `-shortest` ensures the output duration matches the shortest stream.\n- Output file is `presentation.mp4`, overwriting the original.\n\nNote: Overwriting the original file during processing can cause corruption or data loss if the process is interrupted. It is generally safer to output to a new file first.",
