    "output": "Compressing every video file in a folder and overwriting the originals involves a destructive operation because the original files get replaced. To accomplish this with ffmpeg, you can use a shell loop to process each file and output to the same filename, effectively overwriting.\n\nHere is an example command using a bash loop that compresses videos with libx264 codec and rewrites the original files. \n\nNote: This is destructive as it overwrites files, which could cause data loss if anything goes wrong.\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mp4; do ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vcodec libx264 -crf 28 -preset fast -acodec aac -b:a 128k -y \"$f\"; done\n```\n\n- `-y` overwrites the original file without prompt.\n- Adjust `-crf` to control quality (higher means more compression).\n- Assumes input files are MP4; modify the `*.mp4` pattern for other extensions.\n\n**Warning:** This command is destructive and overwrites the original files. Make sure to backup your files before running this.",
