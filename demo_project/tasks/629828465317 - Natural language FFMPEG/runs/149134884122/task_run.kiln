    "output": "To transcode video.mkv to output.m4v and delete the original .mkv file in the same command, you can chain the ffmpeg command with a file removal command using &&. This means the original file will only be deleted if the transcoding succeeds.\n\nHowever, this is a destructive operation as it deletes the original file. Still, here is how you would do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.m4v && rm video.mkv\n```\n\nThis command:\n- converts video.mkv to output.m4v using H.264 video and AAC audio codecs\n- then deletes video.mkv if transcoding was successful\n\nNote: be cautious as this permanently deletes the original.",
