    "output": "To extract a specific 5-minute segment from 15:00 to 20:00 in longvideo.mp4, use the -ss (start time) and -t (duration) options. -ss specifies where to begin, and -t specifies how long to keep. Placing -ss before -i will seek quickly, which is efficient for most use-cases, but may not be frame-accurate. If frame accuracy is vital, move -ss after -i, but it will be slower.\n\nHere, we assume quick extraction is acceptable. This keeps streams unchanged (stream copy) to avoid re-encoding, ensuring fast processing and no quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 00:15:00 -i longvideo.mp4 -t 00:05:00 -c copy output_segment.mp4\n```\n\n- -ss 00:15:00: Start at 15 minutes into the video.\n- -t 00:05:00: Keep 5 minutes duration (ends at 20:00).\n- -c copy: Copy video and audio streams without re-encoding (fast, lossless).\n\nIf you need frame-accurate cutting, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i longvideo.mp4 -ss 00:15:00 -t 00:05:00 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output_segment.mp4\n```\n\nBut for most purposes, stream copy as shown above is ideal.",
