    "output": "To convert a .mov file to Apple ProRes format in a new .mov container suitable for professional editing software, you should use the ProRes encoder (`prores_ks` or `prores_aw`) with a high-quality profile. ProRes preserves quality well for editing and is widely supported by professional NLEs like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premiere, and DaVinci Resolve.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c:v prores_ks` uses the ProRes codec encoder.\n- `-profile:v` sets the ProRes profile; `3` corresponds to the standard HQ (high quality) profile which balances quality and filesize.\n- Audio is commonly copied (`-c:a copy`) if the source audio is already compatible. Otherwise, you can re-encode it to PCM or AAC.\n- Output file extension `.mov` since ProRes is typically stored in MOV containers.\n\nHere is the command assuming you want standard HQ ProRes with audio copied directly:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i clip.mov -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -c:a copy output_prores.mov\n```\n\nIf the input audio codec is not supported or you want uncompressed audio, replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a pcm_s16le`.\n\nThis approach retains very high video quality suitable for professional editing workflows.",
