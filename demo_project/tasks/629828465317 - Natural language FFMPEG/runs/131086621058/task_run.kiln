    "output": "To automate resizing a batch of videos in a folder to 1080p and save them as MP4 files, you can write a simple shell script (bash) that loops through all video files, resizes them using ffmpeg, and outputs each in MP4 format. Here are key points and best practices:\n\n- Use a for-loop to process each video file in the input folder.\n- Use `ffmpeg`'s `-vf scale=-2:1080` filter to resize videos to 1080p height while preserving aspect ratio. The `-2` ensures width is divisible by 2 (a common requirement).\n- Select efficient and compatible encoding: H.264 for video (`libx264`), AAC for audio.\n- Use CRF (constant rate factor) to control quality, e.g., 23 is a good start.\n- Use `-preset fast` to balance speed and quality.\n- Use `-pix_fmt yuv420p` to ensure compatibility.\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` to make the MP4 files optimized for streaming.\n- You can customize or extend to check and skip already processed files, handle spaces in filenames, etc.\n\nHere's a sample bash script you can run in the folder containing your videos or adjust paths as needed:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Create output directory if it doesn't exist\nmkdir -p output\n\nfor input_file in *.*; do\n    # Skip if not a video by checking extension (adjust extensions as needed)\n    if [[ \"$input_file\" =~ \\.(mp4|avi|mkv|mov|flv|wmv|webm)$ ]]; then\n        # Extract filename without extension\n        filename=\"${input_file%.*}\"\n        output_file=\"output/${filename}_1080p.mp4\"\n        \n        echo \"Processing '$input_file' -> '$output_file' ...\"\n        \n        ffmpeg -i \"$input_file\" -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \"$output_file\"\n        \n        echo \"Done with '$input_file'\"\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The script processes all common video types in the current directory.\n- It outputs resized MP4s in a subfolder named `output`.\n- Resizing uses 1080p height, preserving aspect ratio.\n- Encoding is set for compatibility and decent quality.\n- The process prints status messages to track progress.\n\nYou can run this script by saving it, e.g., as `resize_videos.sh`, then executing:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x resize_videos.sh\n./resize_videos.sh\n```\n\nThis approach automates batch processing, making it reproducible and efficient.",
