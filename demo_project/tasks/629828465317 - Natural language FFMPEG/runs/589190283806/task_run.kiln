    "output": "To split an MKV file into two shorter MKV files without re-encoding, you can use ffmpeg's stream copy mode (`-c copy`). This copies the audio and video streams as-is without transcoding, which is very fast and preserves original quality.\n\nYou need to specify the start time (`-ss`) and the duration (`-t`) for each segment. Since MKV supports arbitrary splitting points, this method will work fine, but note that splitting might not be perfectly keyframe-accurate depending on input. For precise cutting, you might want to try keyframe alignment by adjusting the split times.\n\nAssuming you want to split at a specific timestamp (`split_time`), you would:\n\n1. Extract from start (0) to `split_time` as first file.\n2. Extract from `split_time` to end as second file.\n\nExample: Split at 00:10:00 (10 minutes).\n\n```bash\n# First segment: from start to 10 minutes\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 0 -t 00:10:00 -c copy output_part1.mkv\n\n# Second segment: from 10 minutes to end\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -ss 00:10:00 -c copy output_part2.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-ss` before `-i` enables fast seeking, but can be less accurate for stream copy. Placing `-ss` after `-i` is slower but precise.\n- `-t` specifies segment duration.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n\nIf you want maximum accuracy in splitting, place `-ss` and `-t` after `-i` as shown above.\n\nReplace `00:10:00` with your desired split timestamp. If you have multiple split times, run separate commands for each segment accordingly.",
