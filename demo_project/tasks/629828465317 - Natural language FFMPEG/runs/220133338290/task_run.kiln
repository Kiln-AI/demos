    "output": "If a JPEG (.jpg) file is being interpreted as a video file, it’s likely either misnamed (e.g., a frame extracted from a video but still referenced with a .jpg extension), or you need to enforce the image type for compatibility. To convert or re-encode the problematic JPEG to a standard, compliant JPEG format, you can use ffmpeg to read and rewrite the image, ensuring it follows baseline JPEG standards.\n\nThis reads the original file and outputs a new, clean JPEG:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.jpg -vf format=rgb24 -q:v 2 output.jpg\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- -i input.jpg: Specifies the input file.\n- -vf format=rgb24: Ensures the image is in standard RGB color space.\n- -q:v 2: Sets JPEG quality (2 = high quality, 1 = highest, 31 = lowest); 2 is a good default.\n- output.jpg: The corrected output image.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your file is not actually a video with a .jpg extension; it’s a real JPG but potentially malformed or with headers confusing other software.\n- If the file is truly a video misnamed as .jpg, you can extract the first frame as a JPG image:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.jpg -frames:v 1 output.jpg\n```\n\nUse the first command for a standard JPEG re-encode. If ffmpeg reads multiple frames, your input is likely a video, and in that case, use the second command to get a still image.",
