    "output": "To remux a 4K ProRes MOV file to MKV as quickly as possible without re-encoding, you can use stream copying with `-c copy`. This copies the audio and video streams directly without any processing, preserving the original quality and making the process very fast.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c copy` tells ffmpeg to copy all streams as-is.\n- MKV container supports ProRes and many other codecs, so no compatibility issues are expected.\n- Since no re-encoding occurs, the output file size and quality remain unchanged.\n- Just ensure the input streams are compatible with MKV (ProRes in MKV is well supported).\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c copy output.mkv\n```",
