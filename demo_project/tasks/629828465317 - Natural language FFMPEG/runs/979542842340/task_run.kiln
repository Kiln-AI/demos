    "output": "A common reason video files have audio playback issues in some players is the use of uncommon or unsupported audio codecs (e.g., AC3, DTS, etc). To ensure universal compatibility—especially for web, mobile, and most devices—use the AAC audio codec, which is widely supported. To avoid affecting video quality, copy the video stream directly without re-encoding.\n\n- -c:v copy preserves the original video without re-encoding (no quality loss).\n- -c:a aac re-encodes the audio using the AAC codec for broad compatibility.\n- -b:a 192k sets a standard high-quality audio bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart (if outputting MP4) is recommended for web playback.\n\nAssuming your file is input.mkv (or other format), and you want an MP4 output:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command keeps the original video quality and converts the audio to AAC, producing a universally playable file. If your input is already MP4, you may overwrite the file or output to a new filename as needed.",
