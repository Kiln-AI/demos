After conversion, you want to delete the original file automatically.\n\nNote: Deleting the original file automatically makes this a destructive operation, which is usually discouraged as it can lead to data loss if something goes wrong during conversion. However, as per your request, this command performs the deletion after successful conversion.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i old_video.mkv -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4 && rm old_video.mkv\n```",
