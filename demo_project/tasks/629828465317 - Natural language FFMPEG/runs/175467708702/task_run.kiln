    "output": "To convert animation.mov (a QuickTime file) to an MP4 for web use with a limited color palette, you have to reduce colors effectively while maintaining compatibility. Since MP4 videos with limited palettes (like GIF-style palettes) are not standard, the best approach is to reduce the color depth using a palette-based filter and encoding format that supports it. However, widely supported web formats like H.264 don't natively support indexed color palettes. \n\nA practical solution for \"limited color palette\" visual effect is to apply a palette reduction filter (like `paletteuse`) during encoding to reduce color count but still maintain compatibility with common streaming formats, or to apply near-palette-based dithering with a reduced number of colors.\n\nHere I assume:\n\n- You want an MP4 with reduced colors for stylistic or bandwidth reasons.\n- You want broad web compatibility (H.264/AAC).\n- We'll limit colors to 64 using the `pp7` filter (or `palettegen` & `paletteuse` are typically for GIFs, not MP4, so here I reduce colors using `pp7` or `curves` or `format` filters).\n\nSince MP4 can't store palettes, a filter approximation of limited colors is needed. We'll use the `format` filter to convert to a 8-bit pixel format and the `pp7` filter to reduce colors with dithering.\n\nExample command:\n\n- `-vf \"pp7\"` applies a post-processing filter that reduces color banding with some palette reduction.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 codec.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility.\n- `-preset medium`, `-crf 23` balance quality and filesize.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` for audio.\n\nIf you want stronger, explicit palette reduction you could convert to GIF or use alternative containers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i animation.mov -vf \"pp7\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command reduces color artifacts with the `pp7` filter, encodes in H.264, and prepares the MP4 for web streaming with faststart. \n\nIf you want exactly 64 colors, you can use `format=pal8` filter, but it is incompatible with MP4, so not recommended here. The `pp7` filter provides a good balance.",
