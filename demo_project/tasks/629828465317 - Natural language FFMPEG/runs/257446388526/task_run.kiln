    "output": "To reduce the file size of presentation.mp4 by lowering its bit rate, you can use the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) approach for a good balance between quality and compression, or you can set a specific average bit rate. CRF is generally preferred for presentations (which may have still images and low-motion scenes) because it adapts to content while preserving quality.\n\nIn this example, we'll use the H.264 codec with a CRF value of 28, which provides visibly good quality at a much reduced file size for most presentations. For AAC audio, we’ll use 96k for additional size savings.\n\n- -c:v libx264 encodes video with H.264.\n- -crf 28 sets quality (higher = smaller file, lower = better quality; 23 is default, 28 is noticeably smaller with acceptable quality for non-critical content).\n- -preset veryfast speeds up encoding—change to slower for better compression, but slower encode.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 96k compresses audio.\n- -movflags +faststart helps playback start earlier on the web.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i presentation.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart presentation_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want to keep the resolution and frame rate unchanged, just reduce size.\n- The CRF value is a compromise for presentations; adjust (e.g., 26 for higher quality, 30 for even smaller size).\n- If you need a fixed size, target -b:v instead.\n\nLet me know if you need to hit a strict file size or want to set a target bitrate!",
