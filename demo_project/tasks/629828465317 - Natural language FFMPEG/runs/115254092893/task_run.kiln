    "output": "To help reduce background noise in your narration.mp3 using ffmpeg, you can use the built-in afftdn (Adaptive Filtered Frequency Domain Noise reduction) audio filter. This filter suppresses stationary background noise while preserving speech.\n\nParameters:\n- afftdn=nr=20 sets the noise reduction strength. Higher values (e.g., 20) apply more aggressive noise reduction. Adjust as needed based on sample results; values between 10 to 30 are typical.\n- If you want to further tweak the filter for speech/narration, you can use nt=w to optimize filter for wideband speech.\n\nHere's a recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i narration.mp3 -af \"afftdn=nr=20:nt=w\" cleaned_narration.mp3\n```\n\nAssumption: Your input is a typical narration with light-to-moderate stationary background noise. You may need to tweak the `nr` parameter for best results based on your particular recording.",
