    "output": "To crop a 1080x1920 portrait video to a centered 1080x1080 square, you need to use the `crop` video filter with width and height set to 1080. Since the width matches the source width (1080), cropping horizontally is not needed; you will crop vertically by trimming the top and bottom equally. The crop filter parameters will be `crop=1080:1080:0:y` where `y` is the top offset calculated to center the crop.\n\nSince the input height is 1920, and you want 1080, the vertical offset should be (1920 - 1080) / 2 = 420.\n\nCommand explanation:\n\n- `-vf \"crop=1080:1080:0:420\"`: crop to 1080x1080 starting at x=0 (left edge), y=420 (centered vertically).\n- `-c:a copy`: copies audio without re-encoding (assuming audio is present and you want to keep it).\n- For best quality, you may want to specify codecs depending on your use case, but since the user only asked for cropping, this assumes no codec changes.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"crop=1080:1080:0:420\" -c:a copy output_cropped.mp4\n```\n\nIf the input video is in another format or you want to re-encode for certain codecs, you can adjust accordingly. This command preserves the original video codec by default; if you want to re-encode, add `-c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium` or another encoding setting.",
