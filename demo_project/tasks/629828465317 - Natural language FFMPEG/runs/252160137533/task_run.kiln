    "output": "To convert video.mkv to 4K MP4 while achieving a very small file size for email, I'll use aggressive compression settings with H.264 encoding and lower bitrates.\n\nFor 4K resolution (3840x2160) with email-friendly file size:\n- `-vf scale=3840:2160` scales to 4K resolution\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 encoding for compatibility\n- `-preset ultrafast` provides fastest encoding\n- `-crf 18` sets high quality (lower values = better quality)\n- `-b:v 500k` sets very low video bitrate for small file size\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 64k` uses AAC audio at low bitrate\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 18 -b:v 500k -c:a aac -b:a 64k output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: There's an inherent conflict in your requirements - 4K resolution typically produces very large files, while email attachments need to be small (usually under 25MB). This command attempts both but may result in poor quality due to the extremely low bitrate needed for 4K at small file sizes. You may want to consider either reducing resolution or accepting a larger file size.",
