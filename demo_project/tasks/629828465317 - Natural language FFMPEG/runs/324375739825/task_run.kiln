    "output": "To split a large video file (wedding.mp4) into smaller 10-minute segments while preserving the original quality, use ffmpeg's stream copy mode (-c copy). This avoids re-encoding, making the operation fast and lossless.\n\n- -f segment uses the segment muxer to split the file.\n- -segment_time 600 splits every 600 seconds (10 minutes).\n- -c copy copies the original streams without re-encoding.\n- The output filename pattern wedding_part%03d.mp4 will number the segments sequentially.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The input fileâ€™s format (mp4) and codecs are compatible with the chosen container and stream copy.  \n- Splitting at arbitrary points may result in a few second overlap or an incomplete last segment, but is fastest and avoids quality loss.  \n- For more precise splitting at keyframes, add -reset_timestamps 1 for each segment.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i wedding.mp4 -c copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_time 600 -reset_timestamps 1 wedding_part%03d.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will efficiently split your large wedding video into high-quality, lossless 10-minute parts named wedding_part000.mp4, wedding_part001.mp4, etc.",
