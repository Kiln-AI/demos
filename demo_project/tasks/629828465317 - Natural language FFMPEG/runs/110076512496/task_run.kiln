    "output": "Yes, you can remux the audio stream with an offset to correct sync issues without re-encoding the streams, which is faster and preserves quality. This is done using stream copying (`-c copy`) and the audio delay option `-itsoffset`.\n\n- `-itsoffset` specifies the time offset to apply to the input stream (in seconds). Pass a positive value to delay audio or a negative value to advance it.\n- Use `-map` to select the video and audio streams explicitly.\n- Use `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding both audio and video.\n- Make sure to apply the offset only to the audio stream.\n\nAssuming that the audio needs to be delayed by 0.5 seconds, here is the command to remux with audio delayed:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -itsoffset 0.5 -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 1:a -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- The first input (`-i input.mp4`) delivers the video stream as-is (`-map 0:v`).\n- The second input (`-itsoffset 0.5 -i input.mp4`) loads the audio stream delayed by 0.5 seconds (`-map 1:a`).\n- `-c copy` copies both streams without re-encoding.\n- The resulting file will contain video and audio in sync, with audio shifted accordingly.\n\nIf the audio needs to be advanced instead (audio comes too late), use a negative offset, e.g., `-itsoffset -0.5`.\n\n**Note:** Some players might have issues with the resulting timestamps; if problems persist, re-encoding or more advanced editing with filters might be necessary.",
