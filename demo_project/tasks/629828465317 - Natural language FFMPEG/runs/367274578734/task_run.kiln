    "output": "To downscale a 4K video to 1080p and save it as a .mkv file, you should:\n\n- Use the scale video filter to set the height to 1080 pixels while keeping the original aspect ratio (`scale=-2:1080`).\n- Choose appropriate codecs for .mkv, such as H.264 (`libx264`) for video and AAC or Vorbis for audio (here we'll use AAC for compatibility).\n- Set pixel format to `yuv420p` for broad device compatibility.\n- Tune encoding quality and speed as fits (e.g., `-crf 23` for balance, `-preset slow` for better quality at the cost of time).\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input4k.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p output1080p.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is called `input4k.mp4`; replace as needed.\n- Output will be named `output1080p.mkv`; adjust filename as required.\n- Audio is encoded as AAC for maximum compatibility.\n- This preserves aspect ratio and ensures 1080p height.",
