    "output": "To normalize the volume of input.wav so that its peak level reaches -1 dB, use the `-filter:a \"volumedetect\"` filter first to analyze the peak, and then apply the `loudnorm` (for true peak normalization) or `volume` filter for simple peak normalization. Here, I’ll show you the efficient approach using the `volume` filter for peak normalization:\n\n- The `-af \"volumedetect\"` filter can measure the current peak level, but for simple one-step normalization to -1 dBFS, the `-filter:a \"volume=...\"` filter is sufficient.\n- Setting `volume` to “-1dB” increases (or decreases) the signal so the highest peak is at -1 dBFS.\n- Output format is assumed to be WAV for lossless quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -filter:a \"volume=-1dB\" output_normalized.wav\n```\n\nThis command raises the overall volume so that the new maximum peak is at -1 dB, making your audio appropriately louder while avoiding digital clipping. If you need true peak normalization for digital media mastering, the `loudnorm` filter with its `tp` parameter would be preferred, but `volume=-1dB` is a standard and quick method for basic peak normalization.",
