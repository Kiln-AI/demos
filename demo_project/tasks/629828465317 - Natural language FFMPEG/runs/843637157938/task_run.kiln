    "output": "To remove all metadata from an MP3 file with ffmpeg, you would typically create a new file without metadata. However, since you want to modify the file directly, you might try overwriting the same file as output like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.mp3 -map_metadata -1 -c copy song.mp3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map_metadata -1` removes all metadata.\n- `-c copy` copies audio data without re-encoding for speed.\n- The output file is the same as input, so it overwrites it directly.\n\nHowever, please note that overwriting the input file directly isn't always safe and can corrupt the file if ffmpeg can't write properly. Usually, it's recommended to write to a new file then replace manually.\n\nSince you specifically want to modify the original file directly, this command does try to do that, but proceed with caution.",
