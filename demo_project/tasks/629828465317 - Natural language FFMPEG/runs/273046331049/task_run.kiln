    "output": "To permanently embed (burn in) subtitles into a video file, you use the subtitles filter. This \"hardcodes\" the subtitles into the video stream itself so they can't be turned off. The subtitles must be available as an external file (e.g., SRT), or as a stream in a container that ffmpeg can read.\n\nCommon usage:\n\n- -vf subtitles=... applies the subtitles filter.\n- Be sure to use proper paths/escaping if the subtitle filename contains spaces or non-ASCII characters.\n\nAssuming your video is input.mp4 and your subtitles are subs.srt:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=subs.srt -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command does the following:\n\n- -i input.mp4: input video.\n- -vf subtitles=subs.srt: overlays subtitles onto the video.\n- -c:a copy: copies the audio stream unchanged.\n- output.mp4: output file with burned-in subtitles.\n\nIf your subtitle file is in another format (like ASS), adjust the extension in the command.\n\nIf you're on Windows and have issues with font rendering or paths, you may need to provide the full subtitle path and escape backslashes.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The subtitle file is UTF-8 encoded and matches the video's timeline.\n- Both the video and the subtitle file are in the current directory.  \n- There are no special styling needs (for advanced styling, ASS format works best).",
