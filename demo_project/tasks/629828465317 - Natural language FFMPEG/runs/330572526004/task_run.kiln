    "output": "To remove private data or side data during a remux with stream copying, you can use the `-copy_unknown` flag set to 0. By default, ffmpeg preserves unknown streams and side data during stream copy; disabling this option will drop this extra metadata.\n\n- `-c copy` performs stream copy (no re-encoding).\n- `-copy_unknown 0` removes side data and unknown streams from the output.\n- No filters are applied, so original streams are preserved but without the private data.\n\nAssuming your input file is `input.mkv` and you want to output a file `output.mkv` with no private/side data.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy -copy_unknown 0 output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command preserves video, audio, and subtitle streams but strips side data such as private metadata or codec-specific private data blocks. Note some containers/codecs might have specific side data that cannot be removed without re-encoding, but for most cases this suffices.",
