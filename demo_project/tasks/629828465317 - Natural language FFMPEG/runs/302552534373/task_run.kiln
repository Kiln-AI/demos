    "output": "To remove embedded cover art from an MP3 file while copying all other streams without re-encoding, you can use stream copying and selectively exclude the attached picture stream (which is usually the cover art). \n\nIn FFmpeg, cover art in MP3 files is stored as an attached picture stream (usually a video or a data stream). Using the `-map` option, you can include only the audio streams (`-map 0:a`) and exclude the cover art (`-map 0:v?`). The `?` makes the mapping optional if there is no video stream. However, since cover art is typically a \"video\" stream with metadata type \"attachment,\" excluding all video streams removes it.\n\nAlternatively, you can simply map the audio streams only, ignoring any other streams. Using `-c copy` ensures no re-encoding.\n\nHere is a command that copies all audio streams and excludes cover art:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -map 0:a -c copy output.mp3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:a`: Maps all audio streams from input 0 (the input file).\n- `-c copy`: Copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- This excludes the attached picture stream (cover art) because it is not an audio stream.\n\nAssumption:\n- The file contains only audio and cover art streams.\n- You want to keep all audio data intact and remove the embedded cover art.",
