    "output": "Yes, it is possible to extract only the video stream from an AVI file and copy it into an MP4 container without re-encoding. This process is called stream copying or remuxing. However, keep in mind that MP4 containers typically expect video streams to be in codecs compatible with MP4 (commonly H.264 or H.265). If the video codec in the AVI file is not compatible with MP4, the output may not play correctly in players expecting proper MP4 playback.\n\nTo perform stream copying of only the video stream:\n\n- Use `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream without re-encoding.\n- Use `-an` to drop all audio streams (since you want only video).\n- Specify the output container format by the output filename extension (.mp4).\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` to relocate the file metadata to the beginning for better streaming compatibility.\n\nExample command assumes the video codec in the AVI file is compatible with MP4. If your AVI video codec is not compatible, you will need to transcode the video.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v copy -an -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command copies the video stream as is, discards audio, and remuxes the video into an MP4 container suitable for streaming.",
