    "output": "To optimize a large MKV file for web streaming and reduce its size while maintaining good quality, convert it to MP4 using H.264 video and AAC audio codecsâ€”these are widely supported and efficient for streaming. The -movflags +faststart option moves metadata to the beginning of the file for faster playback startup in browsers. Use the -crf (Constant Rate Factor) parameter with libx264 to control quality and compression (a value of 23 is a good balance; lower means better quality, higher means more compression).\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to retain the original resolution.\n- You aim for broad browser/device compatibility.\n- The source MKV contains video/audio compatible with H.264/AAC conversion.\n\nHere's the recommended ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n- -c:v libx264: Encode video with H.264 for compatibility and compression.\n- -crf 23: Balances quality and file size (adjust between 18 [higher quality, larger size] and 28 [lower quality, smaller size] as needed).\n- -preset medium: Good balance of speed and compression; you may use \"slow\" for even better compression at the expense of speed.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: Converts audio to AAC at 128 kbps (sufficient for most web content).\n- -movflags +faststart: Enables immediate streaming/startup in browsers.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures video playback compatibility.\n\nThis conversion will result in a file optimized for smooth, immediate playback and efficient streaming on your website.",
