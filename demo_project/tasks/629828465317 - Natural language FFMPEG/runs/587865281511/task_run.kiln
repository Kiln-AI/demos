    "output": "To mux the subtitles file `subs.ass` into the video file `show.mp4` while keeping all original subtitles, and save as a single MKV container, you can use ffmpegâ€™s stream copying for video, audio, and existing subtitles, and add the new subtitle stream. MKV supports multiple subtitle tracks natively, so all will be preserved.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c copy` copies all streams without re-encoding for a fast and lossless mux.\n- `-map 0` includes all streams from the input video (`show.mp4`), including existing subtitles.\n- `-map 1` adds all streams from the second input file (`subs.ass`), which contains the new subtitle track.\n- Use `-c:s` for subtitles codec; for `.ass` subtitles, copy is possible, so we use `-c:s:1 copy` assuming the new subtitle is the second subtitle stream.\n- Specify output container `.mkv` for subtitle compatibility and stream muxing.\n\nAssumption:  \n- `subs.ass` contains one subtitle stream.\n- `show.mp4` may have zero or more streams, including audio and subtitles.\n- Subtitle codec in `.ass` can be copied.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i show.mp4 -i subs.ass -map 0 -map 1 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command copies all streams from `show.mp4` plus the subtitle from `subs.ass` into `output.mkv` without re-encoding, preserving quality and metadata, and combining original and new subtitles in a single MKV file.",
