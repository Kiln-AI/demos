    "output": "To batch extract 30-second previews starting at 00:10 from every audio file in a folder, you can use a simple shell loop combined with `ffmpeg`. This approach automates the process across all files matching a pattern (e.g., `*.mp3` or `*.wav`) in a directory.\n\nKey points for the `ffmpeg` options:\n- `-ss 00:00:10` seeks to 10 seconds into the input quickly.\n- `-t 30` extracts a 30-second duration segment.\n- `-c copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding (if supported by the format, speeding up the process and avoiding quality loss). If the format or codec does not support stream copy for this operation, you can omit `-c copy` to force re-encoding.\n- Output files are named systematically to avoid conflicts, e.g., appending `_preview` to the original basename.\n  \nExample assumes `.mp3` audio files. Adjust the pattern or codec options as needed for other formats.\n\nHereâ€™s the batch command for a Unix shell (bash):\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n  ffmpeg -ss 00:00:10 -i \"$f\" -t 30 -c copy \"${f%.mp3}_preview.mp3\"\ndone\n```\n\nIf format copy doesn't work (e.g., for some codecs), use this version that re-encodes audio with a common format like AAC:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n  ffmpeg -ss 00:00:10 -i \"$f\" -t 30 -c:a aac -b:a 192k \"${f%.mp3}_preview.m4a\"\ndone\n```\n\nThis approach is easily adaptable to Windows PowerShell or batch scripts by adjusting syntax accordingly.",
