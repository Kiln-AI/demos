    "output": "To efficiently trim the first 10 seconds off your video and save the remaining part in MKV format, you should use the -ss option to seek to the desired start time. For large files, placing -ss before -i uses fast, keyframe-aligned seeking (much faster, possibly less precise), which is efficient for rough cuts. If you need frame-accurate trimming, place -ss after -i (slower, but precise). For best efficiency on large files, keyframe-aligned trimming is often sufficient.\n\n-ss 10 starts the output at 10 seconds.\n-c copy avoids re-encoding, making the operation very fast and lossless (assuming source MKV/MP4 codecs are compatible with MKV).\nThis command assumes you want to efficiently discard the first 10 seconds without re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 10 -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf you need more precise/frame-accurate trimming (slower), use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 10 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nBest practice for handling large files efficiently is to use the first (fast) method unless you specifically need frame accuracy.",
