    "output": "Yes, you can trim the first 5 seconds from a video using stream copy (also called \"copy codec\" mode) with `-ss` and `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding. This is much faster and preserves the original quality, but with a few caveats:\n\n- When using `-ss` as an input option before `-i`, ffmpeg seeks accurately but may still need to decode frames internally to get to the exact frame if the input format doesn't support keyframe-accurate seeking.\n- When using `-ss` as an output option (after `-i`), seeking is frame-accurate but slower.\n- Stream copy trimming generally starts at the nearest keyframe before the requested start time, so the actual trimmed result might start a bit earlier.\n- Some container formats may require re-muxing for proper cutting.\n\nAssuming you want to cut exactly starting at 5 seconds, and are okay with slight inaccuracy depending on keyframes, this command uses `-ss` as an input option for faster start and no re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 5 -i input.mp4 -c copy -avoid_negative_ts make_zero output_trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-ss 5` before `-i` seeks input to 5 seconds.\n- `-c copy` copies all streams without re-encoding.\n- `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero` helps fix timestamp issues in some containers when copying streams.\n- This is best for formats like MP4 or MKV.\n\nIf more precise cutting is needed, re-encoding or keyframe-aligned cuts should be considered.",
