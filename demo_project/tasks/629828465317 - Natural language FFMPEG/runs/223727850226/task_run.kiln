    "output": "To reduce wind noise in your audio recording wind.wav, applying a high-pass filter is effective because wind noise typically occupies the low-frequency range (below 100–150 Hz). A high-pass filter attenuates these low frequencies while preserving the speech and other important sounds.\n\nThe `-af \"highpass=f=150\"` option applies a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 150 Hz (adjust this value as needed; 100–200 Hz are common choices for wind removal in speech). This will help reduce the rumble of wind noise while keeping voice clarity.\n\nHere’s the command to apply a high-pass filter at 150 Hz:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i wind.wav -af \"highpass=f=150\" wind_filtered.wav\n```\n\n**Explanation of parameters:**\n- `-i wind.wav`: Input audio file.\n- `-af \"highpass=f=150\"`: Applies a high-pass filter at 150 Hz.\n- `wind_filtered.wav`: Output file with reduced wind noise.\n\nIf the result is too thin or if some wind noise remains, you can experiment with different cutoff frequencies (`f=100`, `f=200`, etc.) until you achieve the best balance for your recording.",
