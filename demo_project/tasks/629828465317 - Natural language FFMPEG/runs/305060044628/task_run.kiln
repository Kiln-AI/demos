    "output": "Achieving a specific file size (e.g., under 10 MB) while maintaining good quality is challenging with ffmpeg, because quality and file size are influenced by several factors: video duration, resolution, codec efficiency, audio bitrate, and complexity of content.\n\nOften, “failed attempts” happen because:\n\n- **Bitrate/control mismatch**: Using a fixed “-crf” (quality-based) value or default settings gives unpredictable sizes; use average bitrate (“-b:v”) or two-pass encoding for size targeting.\n- **Audio not compressed enough**: Audio can take unnecessary space if left at defaults.\n- **Resolution too high**: High resolutions need more bits to look good.\n- **Too long duration**: No matter the parameters, some videos can’t meet tight size + quality constraints if they’re long or detailed.\n- **Container overhead**: Some output containers are less efficient.\n\n**Best Practice:**  \nUse two-pass encoding with H.264 for efficient compression, target your desired size by calculating total bitrate needed, and consider lowering resolution or audio bitrate as needed.\n\n**How to Calculate Target Bitrate:**  \nSuppose your video is 2 minutes (120 seconds) long:\n- Target size = 10 MB = 80 Megabits (10 × 8)\n- Total bitrate = 80 Megabits / 120 sec ≈ 667 kbps\n- Allocate ≈ 128 kbps to audio, so video bitrate = 667 - 128 = 539 kbps\n\n**Example Command (2-pass, H.264, AAC, assuming input.mp4, for 2-min video):**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 539k -pass 1 -an -f mp4 /dev/null \\\n&& ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 539k -pass 2 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your input is \"input.mp4\".\n- Video is about 2 minutes; adjust bitrates if your video is longer/shorter.\n- Change values if your input video has other specifications.\n\n**Troubleshooting Tips:**\n- Lower resolution (-vf scale=) if quality with low bitrate is poor.\n- Lower audio bitrate if needed.\n- If still too large, reduce bitrate further or trim duration.\n\nLet me know your input file's duration/parameters for precise adjustments!",
