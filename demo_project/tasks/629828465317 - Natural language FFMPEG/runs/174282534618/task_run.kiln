    "output": "To convert a MOV file to AVI format using the MJPEG video codec and uncompressed PCM audio, you should specify the video codec as mjpeg and the audio codec as pcm_s16le (a common uncompressed PCM audio format compatible with editing software). This combination ensures compatibility and minimal quality loss for editing workflows.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v mjpeg -q:v 3 -c:a pcm_s16le output.avi\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v mjpeg sets the video codec to Motion JPEG.\n- -q:v 3 controls visual quality (1 = best, 31 = worst; values 2–5 are commonly used for editing—lower is higher quality).\n- -c:a pcm_s16le sets uncompressed 16-bit little-endian PCM audio for broad compatibility.\n- input.mov is the source file and output.avi is the target file.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The source file is named input.mov.\n- Quality is prioritized for editing, so the video quality is set fairly high with -q:v 3. Adjust as needed for your disk space and workflow.\n- This output produces an AVI file suitable for most editing software.",
