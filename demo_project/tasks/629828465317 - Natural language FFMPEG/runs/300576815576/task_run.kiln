    "output": "To embed subtitles into an MP4 video such that users cannot turn them off, you need to \"burn\" or \"hardcode\" the subtitles into the video itself rather than embedding them as a separate selectable subtitle track. Hardcoding renders the subtitles as part of the video frames, making them always visible and unremovable.\n\nKey points:\n- Use the `subtitles` filter to burn subtitles onto the video.\n- This requires the subtitle file (e.g., .srt) as input.\n- The output will have no separate subtitle track since it is image-composited on the frames.\n- Choose appropriate encoding options to keep a good balance between quality and file size.\n\nExample assumes your subtitle file is `subs.srt` and your input video is `input.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subs.srt\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subs.srt\"` overlays subtitles onto the video.\n- `-c:v libx264`, `-preset slow`, and `-crf 18` encode video with H.264 codec at high quality.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- The output `output.mp4` will have subtitles permanently visible with no way to disable them.\n\nIf your subtitles contain styling (SSA/ASS format), burning them in preserves the styles better than SRT. You would just replace `subs.srt` with your `.ass` file.",
