    "output": "When audio and video are out of sync in an MP4 file, it often means there is a timestamp or container-level issue. A common solution is to remux (remultiplex) the file without re-encoding, using ffmpeg to rewrite the container and fix timestamp issues. If the problem is deeper, re-encoding might be necessary, but first try this lossless approach:\n\n- The `-fflags +genpts` option forces ffmpeg to generate presentation timestamps, which helps correct sync issues.\n- Using `-async 1` or `-vsync 1` can help resynchronize audio and video streams.\n- Copying streams with `-c copy` means no quality loss, just container rewriting.\n\nIf audio delay or advance is consistent and known, `-itsoffset` can offset the audio stream by a specific time (positive or negative). Since the user hasn’t specified this, a general remux to fix timestamps is best.\n\nExample command to remux and regenerate timestamps:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -fflags +genpts -i input.mp4 -c copy -avoid_negative_ts make_zero output_fixed.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-fflags +genpts`: regenerate timestamps.\n- `-avoid_negative_ts make_zero`: shifts timestamps so they do not go negative, which can help sync.\n- `-c copy`: copy audio and video streams without re-encoding.\n\nIf this doesn’t resolve the problem, re-encoding with audio delay adjustment might be required, but that requires exact delay information.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -fflags +genpts -i input.mp4 -c copy -avoid_negative_ts make_zero output_fixed.mp4\n```",
