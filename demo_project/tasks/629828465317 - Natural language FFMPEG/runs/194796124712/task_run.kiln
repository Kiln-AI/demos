    "output": "When extracting subtitles from a Matroska file (.mkv) that are encoded in UTF-16 and converting them to UTF-8, you can use `ffmpeg`'s subtitle codec with a specific encoding option. The trick is to extract the subtitle stream and specify the output subtitle character encoding as UTF-8.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The subtitle is in a format compatible with extraction as text (e.g., SRT, ASS).\n- The subtitles are embedded in the MKV as a separate stream.\n- You want to convert and save the subtitles as a plain text subtitle file (e.g., `.srt`).\n- The first subtitle stream is the targeted one; if not, modify the `-map` accordingly.\n\nHere is a command that extracts the first subtitle stream, converting the charset from UTF-16 to UTF-8:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i encoded_track.mkv -map 0:s:0 -c:s srt -sub_charenc UTF-16 -f srt output_subs.srt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:s:0` selects the first subtitle stream from the input.\n- `-c:s srt` sets the subtitle codec to SRT for extraction.\n- `-sub_charenc UTF-16` tells ffmpeg that the input subtitle charset is UTF-16 (important for decoding).\n- `-f srt` forces output format as SubRip subtitle file.\n- The output file `output_subs.srt` will contain subtitles in UTF-8 encoding by default (the standard encoding for SRT files).\n\nIf the subtitles are in a format other than SRT, replace `-c:s srt -f srt` with the appropriate format, or convert as necessary. This approach ensures proper conversion from UTF-16 to UTF-8 during the extraction process.",
