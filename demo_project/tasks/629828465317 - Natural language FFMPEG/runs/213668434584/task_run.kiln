    "output": "To combine subtitles from two MKV files into a single MKV file with multiple subtitle tracks, you can use `ffmpeg`'s stream copy mode to avoid re-encoding. Specifically:\n\n- Use `-map` to select the video and audio streams from one input (e.g., input1.mkv).\n- Use additional `-map` options to include subtitle streams from both inputs.\n- Use `-c copy` to copy all streams without re-encoding.\n- Assign output file with `.mkv` extension to preserve the Matroska container's support for multiple subtitle tracks.\n\nThis assumes you want to keep the primary video/audio from input1.mkv and just add subtitles from both inputs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input1.mkv -i input2.mkv \\\n-map 0:v -map 0:a \\\n-map 0:s? -map 1:s? \\\n-c copy \\\noutput.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n- `-i input1.mkv -i input2.mkv`: reads the two input files.\n- `-map 0:v -map 0:a`: selects all video and audio streams from the first file.\n- `-map 0:s?`: selects all subtitle streams from first file if present (`?` makes it optional).\n- `-map 1:s?`: selects all subtitle streams from second file if present.\n- `-c copy`: copies all streams (video, audio, subtitles) without encoding.\n  \nThis results in an MKV file that contains video and audio from input1.mkv and subtitle tracks from both inputs as separate tracks.",
