    "output": "To convert a variable frame rate video to a constant frame rate of 25 fps and encode it to an Apple ProRes MOV file with maximum quality, you need to:\n\n- Force the output frame rate to 25 fps using `-r 25`.\n- Use the `prores_ks` encoder, which is a high-quality ProRes encoder supported in ffmpeg.\n- Set the ProRes profile to `hq` (high quality) for near lossless quality.\n- Use `-vsync cfr` to ensure constant frame rate output to avoid timestamp issues.\n- Copy audio or re-encode if needed (default here will copy).\n\nThis command maintains maximum visual quality while ensuring the frame rate is the requested constant 25 fps and the container is MOV.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -r 25 -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -pix_fmt yuv422p10le -vsync cfr -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-r 25` sets the output frame rate.\n- `-c:v prores_ks` uses the ProRes encoder.\n- `-profile:v 3` sets the \"hq\" profile, optimal for high-quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv422p10le` is the native pixel format for ProRes HQ, preserving color and bit depth.\n- `-vsync cfr` ensures constant frame rate muxing.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the original audio stream to avoid quality loss and speed up processing.\n  \nAssumption: The input file is named `input.mp4`; you can replace it with your filename. If audio re-encoding or adjustments are needed, change the audio codec accordingly.",
