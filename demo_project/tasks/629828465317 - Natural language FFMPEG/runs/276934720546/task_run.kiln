    "output": "To reduce the video file size of largevideo.mp4 by roughly 50%, you should lower the bitrate or increase the crf (Constant Rate Factor) value for more compression, and optionally re-encode audio at a lower bitrate. Since exact 50% reduction depends on the source content bitrate and complexity, the most practical way is to estimate the current bitrate and set the new one to half.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n- First, check the current bitrate of the file using:\n  ```\n  ffprobe -v error -select_streams v:0 -show_entries stream=bit_rate -of default=noprint_wrappers=1:nokey=1 largevideo.mp4\n  ```\n  (Suppose this returns 4000k, meaning 4 Mbps.)\n\n- Next, transcode the video with half the original bitrate, and optionally compress audio to 128k.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i largevideo.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart reduced_largevideo.mp4\n```\n\n- -b:v 2000k sets the video bitrate to half (adjust based on the bitrate found by ffprobe).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k compresses audio to 128 kbps (commonly used for space saving).\n- -movflags +faststart helps for smoother streaming/playback.\n\nAssumption: The original video uses a constant bitrate or youâ€™re okay with a rough estimate for file size reduction. For more control over quality, using -crf instead of fixed bitrate is recommended, but for specific size targets, bitrate is more predictable.",
