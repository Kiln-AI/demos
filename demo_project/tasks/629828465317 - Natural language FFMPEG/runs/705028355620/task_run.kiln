    "output": "To create a 48fps duplicate from a 24fps source for smooth slow-motion processing (e.g., if you intend to slow it down to half speed later), you must interpolate frames, rather than simply duplicating them, for a natural look. Using the ffmpeg minterpolate filter achieves optical flow-based interpolation, generating new in-between frames for a fluid motion appearance.\n\n- -filter:v \"minterpolate=fps=48\": Uses motion interpolation to generate intermediate frames, yielding visually smooth 48fps output.\n- -vsync vfr: Ensures the output has a variable framerate if needed, but with interpolation this usually matches the set fps.\n- -c:a copy: Copies the audio stream intact. If you intend to stretch the video for slow-motion, later stretch the audio accordingly, or mute it, as it would get out of sync.\n\nAssumption: You want a 48fps video you can later slow down to 24fps for smooth slow-motion playback.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v \"minterpolate=fps=48\" -c:a copy output_48fps.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will produce a visually correct 48fps version using frame interpolation, optimal for later slow-motion conversion.",
