    "output": "To efficiently reduce the size of a large video file while aiming to maintain as much quality as possible, you can re-encode it using a target bitrate (e.g. 1000 kbps). However, using only a fixed bitrate (-b:v 1000k) may cause quality fluctuations depending on the video’s complexity. A better approach is to use CRF encoding (constant rate factor) which maintains perceptual quality at variable bitrates, but since you specified a bitrate, we'll combine both techniques with two-pass encoding for optimal size and quality.\n\nHere’s how you can do it efficiently:\n\n- Use two-pass encoding (-pass 1 and -pass 2) for H.264 to more evenly distribute bits, especially useful for large files.\n- Set the video bitrate with -b:v 1000k.\n- Downsample or transcode audio to a reasonable bitrate (e.g. 128 kbps AAC).\n- Add -movflags +faststart for quick streaming if intended for web.\n\n**Assumption:** You want H.264+AAC in MP4, a common and efficient format, and preserving quality within the bitrate constraint.\n\nTwo commands (run in sequence):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 1000k -pass 1 -an -f mp4 /dev/null\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 1000k -pass 2 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- The first pass analyzes the video (output to /dev/null).\n- The second pass creates the optimized file.\n\nThis method is best practice for efficiently compressing large media files while maximizing perceptual quality for the given target bitrate.",
