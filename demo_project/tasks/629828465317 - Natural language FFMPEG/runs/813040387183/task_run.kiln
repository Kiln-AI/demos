    "output": "To slow down your video to half its original speed (i.e., make it play twice as slow), you need to adjust both the video and audio streams:\n\n- For the video, use the setpts filter with a value of 2.0*PTS, which stretches the presentation timestamps to twice their original value (slowing it down).\n- For the audio, use the atempo audio filter. atempo only supports values between 0.5 and 2.0 per filter. To halve the speed (x0.5 speed), set atempo=0.5.\n\nKeep in mind: If you want to preserve audio pitch, this approach works; for larger slow-downs, chain multiple atempo filters as needed.\n\nHere’s the appropriate ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i slowmo.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=2.0*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=0.5[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" slowmo_twice_as_slow.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: The input has both video and audio. If there’s no audio, you can skip the audio filter.",
