    "output": "To trim the first minute of video.mp4 and overwrite the original file, you would normally specify the duration with -t 60. However, overwriting the source file directly is destructive and should generally be avoided. But since you explicitly want to save only the trimmed version with the same file name, this command will overwrite the original file with the first minute of video.mp4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -t 60 -c copy video.mp4\n```\n\nNote: This command overwrites the original file, which is destructive. Normally, it's safer to output to a new file and then replace after verifying output.",
