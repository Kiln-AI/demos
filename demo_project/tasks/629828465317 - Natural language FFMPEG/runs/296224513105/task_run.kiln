    "output": "To remove background noise from an audio file like interview.mp3, ffmpeg doesn't have a built-in advanced noise reduction filter comparable to specialized tools (e.g., Audacity or dedicated noise reduction software). However, ffmpeg provides a basic noise gate (\"afftdn\") filter that can help reduce consistent background noise by attenuating quieter signals.\n\n- afftdn applies frequency-domain noise reduction.\n- A higher noise reduction amount removes more noise but can affect audio quality.\n- You can adjust the `nr` (noise reduction) parameter for the filter to tune the amount of noise reduction.\n- This method is best for relatively steady background noise but may not be perfect for complex noise.\n\nFor a basic noise reduction pass, the command would be:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i interview.mp3 -af afftdn=nf=-25 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 cleaned.mp3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-af afftdn=nf=-25`: applies noise filtering with noise floor set to -25 dB; you may adjust this value (`nf`) to increase or decrease noise reduction.\n- `-c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2`: encodes audio using the MP3 codec with high quality (q=2).\n- `cleaned.mp3`: output file with reduced background noise.\n\nAssumption: The background noise in the interview is relatively steady and can be attenuated via spectral noise gating. For more advanced noise reduction, consider using dedicated audio editing tools before or after this step.",
