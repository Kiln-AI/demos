    "output": "To efficiently extract a 10-second audio clip from a large podcast file, you can use ffmpeg’s -ss option to specify the start time and -t to specify the duration. This command performs an in-place “stream copy” (-c copy) which avoids re-encoding and is very fast, making it highly suitable for large files.\n\nAssumption:\n- The excerpt should start at the beginning (00:00:00). If you want a different start time, adjust the value for -ss accordingly.\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -i podcast.mp3 -t 10 -c copy preview.mp3\n```\n\n- -ss 00:00:00: Start at the beginning. Change this to, for example, 01:23:45 for a different section.\n- -i podcast.mp3: Input file.\n- -t 10: Extract a 10-second segment.\n- -c copy: Copy audio without re-encoding (very fast, best for large files). \n\nFor best results with MP3 files, place -ss before -i for maximum speed, and use -c copy to avoid unnecessary processing. If precise cutting on non-keyframes is required, consider re-encoding (drop -c copy) for frame-accurate seeking, but for previews, copy mode is usually sufficient and highly efficient.",
