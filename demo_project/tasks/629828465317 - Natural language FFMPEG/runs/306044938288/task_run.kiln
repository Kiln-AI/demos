    "output": "To quickly remux an MKV file to an MP4 without re-encoding, you can use stream copying. This tells ffmpeg to copy the existing video and audio streams as is, just changing the container format. This is efficient and fast since no decoding or encoding happens.\n\nKey options:\n- `-c copy` means copy all streams without re-encoding.\n- MP4 container supports many codecs like H.264, AAC, but may not support some formats found in MKV (like certain subtitles or audio codecs) well. Assuming your streams are compatible with MP4.\n- If there are subtitle streams or other streams not supported in MP4, you may want to exclude them or map specific streams.\n\nHere is a basic command for remuxing:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-movflags +faststart` moves the metadata to the beginning of the file, which helps with progressive playback/streaming of MP4 files.\n\nIf your MKV has multiple audio or subtitle streams and you only want specific ones, you can use `-map` options, but for a general quick remux, the above works well.",
