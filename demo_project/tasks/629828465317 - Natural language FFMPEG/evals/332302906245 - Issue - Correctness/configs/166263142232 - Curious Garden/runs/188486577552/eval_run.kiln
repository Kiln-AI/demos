  "input": "My file `archive.mkv` has three audio tracks. I need to extract the second audio track and the main video track into a new file `output.mp4` without re-encoding anything.",
  "output": "To extract the second audio track and main video track without re-encoding, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` option and copy codecs to avoid transcoding. This preserves quality and processes much faster since no encoding occurs.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first (main) video stream\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (0-indexed, so index 1 is the second track)\n- `-c copy` copies both video and audio streams without re-encoding\n- The output container MP4 will remux the streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step:\n\n1) Analyze the produced command for validity:\n\nThe model's output:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-i archive.mkv`: Specifies the input file, which is correctly done.\n- `-map 0:v:0`: Specifies that the first video stream from the input should be mapped to the output. This is likely the \"main video track\" mentioned by the user, assuming there's only one video track.\n- `-map 0:a:2`: Indicates that the command attempts to map the third audio stream (0:a:2). However, the user requested the second audio track, which should be `0:a:1`, not `0:a:2`. Given that indexing is 0-based, `0:a:1` correctly corresponds to the second track.\n- `-c copy`: Specifies no re-encoding of the streams, just remuxing, which is consistent with the user's request to avoid re-encoding.\n- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file format, mp4, which is appropriate for the user's request.\n\n2) Check against evaluation criteria:\n\n- The command is mostly runnable but contains an incorrect audio mapping (`-map 0:a:2` should be `-map 0:a:1`), reflecting a misunderstanding of 0-based indexing for audio tracks.\n- The produced ffmpeg command does not correctly follow the user's request for the second audio track due to this index error.\n- There are no invalid parameters or flags in the command, and the suggested command structure is mostly valid.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the eval should fail because the command does not fulfill the user's request due to incorrect mapping of the audio track. The model mistakenly selected a non-existent third audio track (assuming only two exist based on user input). Correcting the mapping to `-map 0:a:1` would make it compliant with the user's request and correct."
