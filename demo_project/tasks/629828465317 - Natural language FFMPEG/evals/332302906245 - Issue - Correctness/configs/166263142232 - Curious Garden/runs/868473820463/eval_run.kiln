  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 8 audio streams. I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. This allows you to choose specific streams by their indices.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_file_index:stream_index` where the input file index is typically 0 for the first (and often only) input file, followed by the stream index within that file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding the streams, which will be faster and maintain original quality. The command maps video stream index 3 (the third video stream) and audio stream index 8 (the eighth audio stream) from the input file to create the output MP4.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Upon reviewing the provided information, let's go through the evaluation step by step:\n\n1) **Command Issues:**\n   - The user specified the intention to use \"video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7\" from the input file `input.mkv`. However, the generated command uses `-map 0:3 -map 0:8`, which is incorrect. The command maps `video stream 0:3` and `audio stream 0:8`, neither of which matches the user's request.\n   - According to FFmpeg's stream indexing, streams start at index 0. So, the user's request for video stream `0:2` and audio stream `0:7` means that the video stream and the audio stream in use should be those respective indices not the ones used in the command.\n\n2) **Criteria Evaluation:**\n   - **Valid Command:** The given command uses valid flags and parameters (`-map` and `-c copy`), and it seems to be syntactically correct and runnable as per FFmpeg syntax.\n   - **Correctness to User Request:** The command fails to follow the user's request by selecting the wrong stream indices. Therefore, it does not adhere to the user directive of using video stream `0:2` and audio stream `0:7`.\n\nIn conclusion, the produced command does not adhere to the user's request due to incorrect stream mapping. Thus, while the command is syntactically valid, it does not fulfill the userâ€™s specified requirement, and the evaluation should fail based on the given criteria."
