  "input": "I want to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of my input file multi_track.mp4 into a single output file",
  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Examination of the produced command:**\n\nThe produced ffmpeg command is:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- **`-i multi_track.mp4`:** Specifies the input file, which is correct as per the user request.\n\n- **`-map 0:2`:** This maps the third stream (index 2) from the input file. The user requests video from stream 2, which is correctly identified with zero-based index.\n\n- **`-map 0:7`:** This maps the eighth stream (index 7) from the input file. The user requests audio from stream 7, which is correctly identified with zero-based index.\n\n- **`-c copy`:** This command tells ffmpeg to copy the streams as they are, without re-encoding. This satisfies the userâ€™s requirement to merge the specific streams into a new file and maintains the original quality, since there is no conversion or compression.\n\n- **`output.mp4`:** Specifies the output file name, which is also correct.\n\nThe command is valid and matches user input based on the description in the man page.\n\n2) **Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n- **Produces a valid and runnable ffmpeg command:** Yes, the command is a standard ffmpeg command and is runnable. There are no invalid flags or parameters.\n\n- **Follows user request as much as possible:** Yes, the command selects the correct video and audio streams using `-map` and copies them into a single output file, as requested by the user. The model correctly uses zero-based indexing to map the requested streams.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe evaluation should pass. The produced ffmpeg command is both valid and follows the user's request accurately."
