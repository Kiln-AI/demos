  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 8 audio streams. I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. This allows you to choose specific streams by their indices.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_file_index:stream_index` where the input file index is typically 0 for the first (and often only) input file, followed by the stream index within that file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding the streams, which will be faster and maintain original quality. The command maps video stream index 3 (the third video stream) and audio stream index 8 (the eighth audio stream) from the input file to create the output MP4.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Step 1: Does the model's output contain the issue described?\n- The user's requirement: Use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 from input.mkv to create output.mp4.\n- The provided command:\n  ```\n  ffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n  ```\n- Issue: In ffmpeg, streams are zero-indexed internally, so video stream 0:2 means the third video stream, audio stream 0:7 means the eighth audio stream. \n- However, the model maps 0:3 and 0:8, which are the fourth video and ninth audio streams, not 0:2 and 0:7 as requested.\n\nStep 2: Is the model's output similar to the example of failing output?\n- The example of failing output is a command using nonexistent parameters.\n- In this case, the parameters exist, but the stream indices do not match the user's input, leading to incorrect stream selection.\n\nStep 3: Does the model's output contain the issue?\n- Yes. The model's command is incorrect: it does not select the correct video and audio streams as per the user's requirement (off by one error in stream indices).\n\nFinal answer: **Fail**"
