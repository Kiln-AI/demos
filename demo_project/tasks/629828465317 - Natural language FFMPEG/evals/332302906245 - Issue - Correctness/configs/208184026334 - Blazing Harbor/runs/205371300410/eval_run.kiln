AVI format can handle H.265 streams, and the higher compression will reduce file size significantly compared to H.264.\n\nThe command uses:\n- c:v libx265 for H.265/HEVC video encoding\n- crf 28 for good quality balance (lower values = higher quality)\n- preset medium balances encoding speed and compression\n- c:a copy preserves the original audio without re-encoding\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a copy video.avi\n```",

    "reasoning": "**Analysis of the Proposed FFmpeg Command**\n\nOkay, so I'm looking at this proposed FFmpeg command for converting an MP4 to AVI using H.265 (HEVC) and something immediately strikes me. While the command itself *appears* correct at first glance, specifying the input and output files, using `libx265` for HEVC encoding, a reasonable CRF value and preset, and copying the audio, there's a serious underlying issue: the AVI container.\n\nMy gut feeling is that AVI and HEVC aren't a good match. AVI is an ancient format, and while FFmpeg is incredibly versatile and *might* be able to force this combination, that doesn't mean it's standard or a good idea. In fact, it's pretty much guaranteed to cause playback issues across a wide range of media players. I know that the AVI format predates HEVC by decades.\n\nDigging deeper, I remember that the AVI format relies on FourCC codes to identify the video codec. There's no standard FourCC code for HEVC (h265 or hevc), so FFmpeg is likely using some non-standard entry. This is a red flag.  I can almost *hear* FFmpeg complaining about this, perhaps generating a warning about non-standard combinations. I should check the output of `ffmpeg` immediately.\n\nMy experience and standard practice say that if I need to use HEVC, I should be using a modern container like MKV or MP4.  These containers are designed to handle modern codecs like HEVC correctly.  Any expert in my field would be wary of creating an AVI file with an HEVC codec, because it's an inefficient use of my time, and a recipe for user frustration. This means the model's claim that AVI can handle HEVC is technically incorrect, from a compatibility and standards perspective, it's just not good advice. The resulting file is likely not playable in most scenarios, which makes this entire response a failure. If I were the user, I'd want a command tailored for MKV or MP4."
