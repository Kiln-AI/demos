  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio filters - normalize volume, remove noise, and add a fade in/out effect. Can you show me the filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple audio filters in sequence, you'll use the `-af` (audio filter) parameter with filters separated by commas. This creates a filter chain where audio passes through each filter in order: volume normalization, noise reduction, and fade effects.\n\nFor your specific requirements:\n- `dynaudnorm` normalizes volume dynamically\n- `afftdn` removes noise using spectral subtraction\n- `afade` adds fade in and fade out effects\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2;afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n```\n\nThe filter chain applies:\n1. Dynamic audio normalization to even out volume levels\n2. FFT denoising with noise reduction factor of 10\n3. 2-second fade in starting at 0 seconds, followed by 2-second fade out starting at 58 seconds (adjust timing based on your audio length)\n\nThe semicolon separates the two fade filters since they're both `afade` filters with different parameters.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Step-by-step evaluation:\n\n1. **Valid and Runnable Command:**  \n   - The command given is:\n     ```\n     ffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2;afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n     ```\n   - It uses standard arguments and filters: `-i`, `-af`, and two `afade` filters separated by a semicolon.\n   - The filter chain includes `dynaudnorm`, `afftdn`, and two `afade` filters.\n   - `dynaudnorm` and `afftdn` are standard ffmpeg audio filters.\n   - The command syntax essentially chains these filters.\n   - **BUT:** In ffmpeg filter syntax, filters are separated by commas to make a chain. If you want to apply the same filter (afade) twice (with different arguments), you just add them with a comma as part of the chain, e.g.,  \n     `... -af \"filter1,filter2,afade=...,afade=...\" ...`  \n     The semicolon in ffmpeg's filtergraph denotes splitting into different streams (complex filtergraphs). Here, it isn't necessary; the correct approach is using a comma.\n   - **Conclusion:** The semicolon between the two `afade` filters is not the correct way to write a simple serial filter chain; this command will fail. (ffmpeg will treat `afade` after the semicolon as a new, parallel audio stream, which is not intended here.)\n\n2. **Does it Follow the User Request?**\n   - The explanation is correct and covers the intention (normalize, denoise, fade in/out).\n   - The selection of filters (`dynaudnorm`, `afftdn`, `afade`) matches the goal.\n   - The attempt to apply both fade-in and fade-out is correct in intention.\n\n3. **Other Considerations:**\n   - Assumes a fixed fade-out start time of 58s, without explicit input from the user about the duration â€” but the model does clarify to adjust as needed.\n   - Parameters for the filters are reasonable defaults.\n\n**Final Judgment:**  \n**FAIL**\n- The produced command will not run as intended because the use of a semicolon in the `-af` simple filterchain is not valid ffmpeg syntax. To chain multiple `afade` filters, you must separate them with a comma (for serial application).\n\n**Example of a correct command:**\n```\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2,afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n```\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe model's intent and filter choices are good, but the command would not run due to invalid chaining syntax. **Eval FAILS.**"
