  "output": "To extract a specific video track and audio stream from your input file, you'll use FFmpeg's stream mapping feature with the `-map` parameter to select exactly which streams you want in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:0` selects the first video stream from the input file\n- `-map 0:5` selects the sixth audio stream from the input file  \n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:6 -c:v copy -c:a copy simple.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes your input file has at least 6 audio streams (indexed 0-5) and uses stream copying to avoid quality loss and speed up the process.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's step through the evaluation:\n\n**1. Command validity:**  \nThe command given is:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:6 -c:v copy -c:a copy simple.mp4\n```\n- All flags and syntax are valid ffmpeg options.\n- `-i complex.mov` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:6` is mapping the seventh stream from input 0 (streams are zero-indexed).\n- Copying both video and audio streams (`-c:v copy -c:a copy`) is valid, and generally best when simply \"combining\" without alteration.\n- Output file name is `simple.mp4`.\n\n**2. Does it follow the user's request?**  \nThe user's message was:\n> Take the first video track (0:0) and the sixth audio stream (0:5) from my input file complex.mov and combine them into simple.mp4\n\n- The user wants the first video (0:0) and the sixth audio stream (0:5).\n- The command maps video 0:0 (correct) and audio 0:6 (incorrect).\n- Streams are numbered from zero, so the sixth audio stream is 0:5, not 0:6.\n- Therefore, the command is mapping the audio stream AFTER the requested one.\n\n**3. Any other issues?**\n- Explanation was correct except in the command the mapping index is wrong for the audio stream.\n- The assumptions and explanation noted stream indices, and mapped the correct video, but got the audio mapping wrong in the command (explained 0:5 but wrote 0:6).\n\n**Verdict:**  \nThis does not pass the eval. The `-map 0:6` is not the 6th audio stream; it is the seventh stream (assuming the default ordering of streams: video, audio, etc).  \nThe criteria say: \"the produced ffmpeg command follows user request, as much as a valid command can follow the user request\".\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**FAIL** â€” The command does not map the requested sixth audio stream (should be `-map 0:5`), so the answer does NOT pass according to the eval criteria."
