For maximum quality MP3, use a bitrate of 320 kbps which is the highest standard bitrate for MP3.\n\n- `-vn` disables video processing since we only want audio\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` uses the LAME MP3 encoder for high quality\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (maximum standard MP3 bitrate)\n- `-q:a 0` sets the quality to highest (0 is best quality for VBR, but we're using CBR here)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 audio.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model output against the outlined criteria:\n\n**1. Valid, runnable ffmpeg command?**\n\n- The command:\n  ```bash\n  ffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 audio.mp3\n  ```\n- All of these are valid ffmpeg parameters:\n  - `-i video.mkv`: input file provided\n  - `-vn`: disables video stream, as only audio is to be extracted/encoded\n  - `-c:a libmp3lame`: chooses MP3 (LAME) encoder\n  - `-b:a 320k`: sets audio bitrate to 320kbps (the maximum for standard MP3)\n  - `-q:a 0`: sets audio quality to best for variable bitrate (VBR), but see below for interaction with `-b:a`\n\n**2. Matches user request?**\n\n- The user wants to extract audio from video.mkv and save as high-quality MP3 with maximum bitrate.\n- The model chooses the correct encoder (`libmp3lame`) and sets to maximum standard MP3 bitrate (320kbps).\n- User didn't specify CBR vs. VBRâ€”both quality (VBR) and bitrate (CBR) are addressed, but usage of both together is somewhat redundant/conflicting: in ffmpeg, if both `-b:a` (CBR) and `-q:a` (VBR) are specified, behavior can be unpredictable and may revert to CBR.\n- The explanation notes that CBR is being used, so `-b:a 320k` is the controlling/important parameter. Including `-q:a 0` is harmless but unnecessary here.\n\n**3. Would the command run?**\n\n- Yes, the command runs. ffmpeg would encode the audio to mp3 at 320kbps. It might either ignore one of the parameters (`-q:a 0`) or prefer the CBR bitrate command as intended.\n\n**4. Does it explain assumptions?**\n\n- The model explains the rationale behind parameter selection, including that 320k is the standard maximum for MP3.\n\n**5. Is any small issue a true 'fail'?**\n\n- The only small confusion is specifying both `-b:a` and `-q:a` flags (CBR vs VBR), which is slightly redundant in ffmpeg, but doesn't invalidate the command.\n- This doesn't warrant a fail under the guidance: \"Only fail commands that make a mistake, not just those that could be improved in some way.\"\n\n**Conclusion: The model output should PASS.**\n\n- The produced ffmpeg command is valid, runnable, and accomplishes the user's task as described.\n- The command slightly over-specifies parameters, but errs on the side of user benefit and clarity.\n- Explanations are correct and informative.\n- No hard or soft invalidities.\n\n**Eval result: PASS**"
