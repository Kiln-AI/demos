  "output": "To extract a specific video track and audio stream from your input file, you'll use FFmpeg's stream mapping feature with the `-map` parameter to select exactly which streams you want in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:0` selects the first video stream from the input file\n- `-map 0:5` selects the sixth audio stream from the input file  \n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:6 -c:v copy -c:a copy simple.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes your input file has at least 6 audio streams (indexed 0-5) and uses stream copying to avoid quality loss and speed up the process.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let me analyze the model's output step by step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe issue is about generating incorrect ffmpeg commands that don't work or don't match user requirements. Let me examine the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:6 -c:v copy -c:a copy simple.mp4\n```\n\nThe user requested:\n- First video track (0:0) ✓\n- Sixth audio stream (0:5) ❌\n\nThe model used `-map 0:6` instead of `-map 0:5`. This is a critical error because:\n- Stream indexing starts at 0\n- The \"sixth audio stream\" would be indexed as 0:5, not 0:6\n- Using 0:6 would actually select the seventh stream, not the sixth\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n\nYes, it's similar in nature. While the failure example shows a non-existent preset, this output shows an incorrect stream index. Both are concrete technical errors that would cause the command to either fail or produce incorrect results.\n\n3) **Does the model's output contain the issue?**\n\nYes, the model's output contains the issue. The command uses `-map 0:6` when it should use `-map 0:5` to select the sixth audio stream. This is a factual error in the ffmpeg command syntax that doesn't match the user's requirements.\n\nAdditionally, the model's explanation correctly states \"selects the sixth audio stream\" but then provides the wrong index in the actual command, showing an inconsistency between explanation and implementation.\n\n**Conclusion: FAIL** - The model generates an incorrect ffmpeg command that doesn't match the user's requirements."
