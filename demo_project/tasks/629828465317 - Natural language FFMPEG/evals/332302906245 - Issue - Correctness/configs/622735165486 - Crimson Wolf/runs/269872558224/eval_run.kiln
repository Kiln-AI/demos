  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 6 audio streams. I need to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12 for my output file final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you use the `-map` parameter to specify which input streams to include in the output. This allows you to cherry-pick exactly which video and audio tracks you want.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_index:stream_type:stream_index` where stream indices start from 0. So to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:v:8` selects video stream 8 from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:12` selects audio stream 12 from input 0  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\nI assumed your input file is named something like `input.mkv` since you didn't specify the filename, and used copy mode to preserve quality and speed up processing.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let me analyze the model's output step by step:\n\n## Step 1: Does the model's output contain the issue described?\n\nThe issue is about the model making mistakes in ffmpeg commands that cause them to not work correctly or match user requirements.\n\nLooking at the user's request:\n- User has a file with 4 video streams and 6 audio streams\n- User wants to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12\n\nLooking at the model's command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\n## Step 2: Analysis of the command correctness\n\nThere's a critical error here. The user states they have a file with:\n- 4 video streams (so valid video stream indices would be 0, 1, 2, 3)\n- 6 audio streams (so valid audio stream indices would be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n\nBut the model's command tries to select:\n- Video stream 8 (which doesn't exist - only streams 0-3 exist)\n- Audio stream 12 (which doesn't exist - only streams 0-5 exist)\n\nThis command would fail with an error like \"Stream specifier '0:v:8' does not match any streams\" because stream 8 doesn't exist when there are only 4 video streams (indexed 0-3).\n\n## Step 3: Does this match the failure pattern?\n\nYes, this is similar to the failure example. Just like the example used a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), this command references non-existent streams (video stream 8 when only 0-3 exist, audio stream 12 when only 0-5 exist).\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The model's output DOES contain the issue described.** The command will fail because it attempts to map streams that don't exist in the input file. The model failed to recognize that if there are only 4 video streams, the highest valid index is 3, not 8, and if there are only 6 audio streams, the highest valid index is 5, not 12.\n\nThis is a clear case of generating an ffmpeg command that doesn't work correctly and doesn't match what's actually possible given the user's file specifications."
