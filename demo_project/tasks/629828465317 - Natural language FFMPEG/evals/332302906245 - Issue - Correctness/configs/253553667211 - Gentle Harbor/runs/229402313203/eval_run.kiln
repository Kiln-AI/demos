  "input": "I want to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of my input file multi_track.mp4 into a single output file",
  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here: The command must work correctly and match user requirements (take video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of the input).\n\nThe model's answer uses:\n```\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\nIt also correctly explains that `-map` uses zero-based indexing and that streams are specified as `-map input_index:stream_index`.\n\nSo it maps stream 2 (third stream) and stream 7 (eighth stream) from the file as desired. It uses `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding, which is appropriate to just combine selected streams.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to the failure example?\n\nNo. The command is syntactically correct. It uses valid parameters and the approach is standard for stream selection.\n\n3) Does the command break any requirements from the man page?\n\nNo. The usage of `-map 0:2` and `-map 0:7` is correct for selecting streams from input file 0. The usage of `-c copy` is valid to copy streams. The order of options is correct. The model also explained the reasoning.\n\n4) Considering the above:\n\nThe command is valid, meets the user request, and is explained well.\n\nNo correctness issues.\n\n# Final assessment:\n\nThe model correctly produced a valid, working ffmpeg command matching the user's request to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of a single input file, without re-encoding.\n\nThe explanation is clear and accurate.\n\nThis is a correct and high quality answer."
