  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 8 audio streams. I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. This allows you to choose specific streams by their indices.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_file_index:stream_index` where the input file index is typically 0 for the first (and often only) input file, followed by the stream index within that file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding the streams, which will be faster and maintain original quality. The command maps video stream index 3 (the third video stream) and audio stream index 8 (the eighth audio stream) from the input file to create the output MP4.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Step 1: Check if the command matches the user's request.\n\n- User wants to select video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 from input.mkv and create output.mp4.\n- Model command: \n  ```\n  ffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n  ```\n- Model maps streams 0:3 and 0:8 instead of 0:2 and 0:7.\n- The index is off by one for both streams.\n\nStep 2: Verify if ffmpeg parameters used are valid.\n\n- `-map` uses zero-based indexing, so the user's requested streams are 0:2 (third video stream) and 0:7 (eighth audio stream).\n- The model uses 0:3 and 0:8 instead, which are the fourth video stream and ninth audio stream (indexes start at 0). Since the input reportedly has only 4 video and 8 audio streams, the model's 0:8 likely doesn't exist.\n- The parameter `-c copy` is valid and copies streams without re-encoding.\n\nStep 3: Does this break any ffmpeg requirements?\n\n- Using stream indexes that don't exist (0:8 when there's only 8 audio streams indexed 0:0 to 0:7) would cause ffmpeg to fail.\n- The command will fail due to out-of-range stream mapping.\n\nStep 4: Final conclusion on correctness.\n\n- The ffmpeg command is invalid because it maps the wrong stream indexes.\n- The model is off by one for both video and audio streams.\n- This will cause the command to fail, not fulfilling the user's request.\n\nOverall, the model output contains correctness issues: it does not correctly interpret the user request for video 0:2 and audio 0:7, and produces invalid stream indexes that will cause ffmpeg to fail. The rest of the command is fine (using `-map` and `-c copy`).\n\n# Final evaluation\n\nThe model's command is invalid because it uses the wrong stream indices (0:3 and 0:8 instead of 0:2 and 0:7), likely causing ffmpeg to fail. Thus, this output is incorrect and does not fulfill the user's request correctly."
