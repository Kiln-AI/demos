  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio filters - normalize volume, remove noise, and add a fade in/out effect. Can you show me the filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple audio filters in sequence, you'll use the `-af` (audio filter) parameter with filters separated by commas. This creates a filter chain where audio passes through each filter in order: volume normalization, noise reduction, and fade effects.\n\nFor your specific requirements:\n- `dynaudnorm` normalizes volume dynamically\n- `afftdn` removes noise using spectral subtraction\n- `afade` adds fade in and fade out effects\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2;afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n```\n\nThe filter chain applies:\n1. Dynamic audio normalization to even out volume levels\n2. FFT denoising with noise reduction factor of 10\n3. 2-second fade in starting at 0 seconds, followed by 2-second fade out starting at 58 seconds (adjust timing based on your audio length)\n\nThe semicolon separates the two fade filters since they're both `afade` filters with different parameters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Step 1: Check if the command matches the user's requirements.\n- User wants to apply multiple audio filters: normalize volume, remove noise, and add fade in/out.\n- The model uses ffmpeg -af with filters: dynaudnorm (dynamic normalization), afftdn (noise reduction), and two afade filters separated by semicolon for fade in and fade out.\n- Filter chain syntax uses correct syntax with commas for chaining and semicolon to separate multiple afade filters that overlap.\n\nStep 2: Check for invalid or incorrect parameters.\n- dynaudnorm exists and performs dynamic normalization.\n- afftdn is the FFT-based denoiser with the parameter nr=10, which is valid.\n- afade is the correct filter for fading audio; separate fade-in and fade-out with appropriate params and separated by semicolon.\n- The fade-out uses st=58 (start time), which assumes an audio length longer than 60 seconds for a 2-second fade out. The model remarks this may need adjustment based on actual audio length.\n- The command line syntax is correct: -af \"filterchain\".\n\nStep 3: Check compliance with ffmpeg requirements from the man page.\n- The use of -af followed by correct filter chain is supported.\n- The filters used are all valid audio filters.\n- No invalid or misspelled parameters.\n- The semicolon usage is valid to separate filters when needed.\n- Assumes input filename input.wav and output.wav, which the explanation says to adjust as needed.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion on correctness.\n- The command is valid, syntactically and semantically.\n- The command does exactly what was requested.\n- The explanation is clear about the filter chain and parameters.\n- Minor assumption about audio duration for the fade-out start time is noted.\n\nFinal evaluation: The model output is correct and usable for the task, and the command is valid and matches user requirements.\n\n# Rating: Pass"
