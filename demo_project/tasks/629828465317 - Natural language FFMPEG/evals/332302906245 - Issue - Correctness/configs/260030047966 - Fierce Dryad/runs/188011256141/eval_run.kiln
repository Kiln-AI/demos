  "input": "I want to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of my input file multi_track.mp4 into a single output file",
  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Evaluating the criteria step by step:\n\n- **Validity and Runability:** The command provided by the model is valid and should run successfully with ffmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` parameter to select specific streams from the multi-track file, and `-c copy` is used to copy the streams without re-encoding, ensuring faster processing and maintaining quality.\n  \n- **Adherence to User Request:** The user requested to merge stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file into an output file. The model correctly identifies that ffmpeg uses zero-based indexing, and therefore, it maps stream 2 (video) using `-map 0:2` and stream 7 (audio) using `-map 0:7`. This is exactly in line with the user's request.\n\nThe model did an excellent job explaining the use of the `-map` parameter and providing a direct, appropriate ffmpeg command. The command is both valid and accomplishes the task as specified by the user. \n\nThe eval should pass as the model met all the necessary criteria, providing a valid, runnable command that aligns with the user's request."
