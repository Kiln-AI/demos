  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 6 audio streams. I need to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12 for my output file final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you use the `-map` parameter to specify which input streams to include in the output. This allows you to cherry-pick exactly which video and audio tracks you want.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_index:stream_type:stream_index` where stream indices start from 0. So to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:v:8` selects video stream 8 from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:12` selects audio stream 12 from input 0  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\nI assumed your input file is named something like `input.mkv` since you didn't specify the filename, and used copy mode to preserve quality and speed up processing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Let's evaluate the command against the criteria step by step:\n\n- The command is syntactically correct and valid based on ffmpeg parameters, with each part of the command logically set up to perform the desired actions. It uses the `-map` parameter correctly to specify streams for both video and audio.\n  \n- The user requested to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12 for the output file. In the ffmpeg command, this request is properly followed by using `-map 0:v:8` and `-map 0:a:12`, starting from an assumption of common index starting at 0, which is standard in ffmpeg.\n\n- The use of `-c copy` is appropriate as it allows the streams to be copied directly without re-encoding, which matches the userâ€™s implicit needs for maintaining original quality and efficiency.\n\n- The model made a reasonable assumption about the input file's name being `input.mkv` since it wasn't specified and could likely contain multiple streams, as indicated by the indices used. \n\n2) Additional considerations:\n- There are no invalid parameters or flags used in this command, fulfilling the requirement that the command should be error-free.\n- The model addressed a naming assumption directly by informing the user, which is a good practice when information is missing.\n\nOverall, the model provided a valid and executable ffmpeg command, and importantly, it adheres to the user's request within the assumptions it had to make.\n\nThe evaluation result is a pass."
