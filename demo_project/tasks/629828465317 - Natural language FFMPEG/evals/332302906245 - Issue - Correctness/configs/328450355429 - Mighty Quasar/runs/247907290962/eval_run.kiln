  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "VP9 is a video codec typically used with the WebM container, not AVI. AVI container doesn't officially support VP9, so muxing VP9 into AVI may cause compatibility issues or may not be supported by ffmpeg.\n\nAssuming you still want to proceed to transcode input.mp4 into an AVI file using libvpx-vp9 codec with 2-pass encoding, I'll show you the commands. Note that libvpx-vp9 is the VP9 encoder commonly used, and 2-pass encoding improves the quality/bitrate tradeoff.\n\nThe process:\n- First pass: analyze video and create log file; output discarded.\n- Second pass: do actual encoding using analysis data; output saved.\n- Choose suitable bitrate since VP9 is bitrate controlled using -b:v.\n- Audio in AVI typically uses codecs like PCM or MP3 since AAC is not common in AVI; I'll choose MP3 audio.\n\nExample uses 1M bitrate, adjust as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1M -pass 1 -an -f avi /dev/null && \\\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1M -pass 2 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 4 output.avi\n```\n\nNote: On Windows, replace `/dev/null` with `NUL`, and use separate commands rather than chaining with &&. Also, 2-pass VP9 in AVI is unusual and may be unsupported by most players.\n\nIf a WebM or MKV container is acceptable, VP9 support is native and is recommended. Let me know if you want commands for that.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. It recognizes that the AVI container does not officially support the VP9 codec, which is a significant compatibility concern. This suggests that the command may not work correctly, as it may create an output file that cannot be played back in common media players or may encounter issues during playback. \n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided, since the ffmpeg command generated by the model is constructed correctly and does not contain any nonexistent options. The failure example describes a command that would fail due to an invalid option, while the command produced by the model is technically valid in terms of syntax.\n\n3) The command output by the model does not break any explicit requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page, but it does use the VP9 codec with an unsupported container format (AVI). While syntactically correct, using VP9 in AVI can lead to unexpected behavior or compatibility issues. So, while it may not directly violate any syntax rules, it contravenes best practices for using codecs in appropriate container formats.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output fails the evaluation because it issues a command that may not work correctly due to a mismatch between codec and container. The model should have recommended a more compatible container, like WebM or MKV, instead of AVI for VP9, thus not adhering to user requirements effectively."
