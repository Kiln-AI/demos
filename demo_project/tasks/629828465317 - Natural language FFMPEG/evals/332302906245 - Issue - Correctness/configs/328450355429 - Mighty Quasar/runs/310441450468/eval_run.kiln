  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from the `source.mkv` file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. Based on your request, you want to select stream 15 (video) and stream 22 (audio) from the input file. \n\n- `-map 0:v:15` selects the 15th video stream from the first input file.\n- `-map 0:a:22` selects the 22nd audio stream from the first input file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding, preserving quality and reducing processing time.\n- `output.mp4` is the resulting file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Based on the issued user input, the model's output correctly implements the required ffmpeg command to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file. It uses the appropriate `-map` options and `-c` parameters for copying the streams without re-encoding. There are no evident errors in the command, and it aligns with the user's request. Therefore, the model's output does **not** contain the issues described.\n\n2) The command generated by the model is not similar to the failure example provided. The command includes valid options according to the ffmpeg documentation and adheres to the correct syntax. There are no invalid or non-existent parameters like `extra_fast` in the output. Hence, it does not represent a failing output.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-map`, `-c:v copy`, `-c:a copy`) are valid and correctly implemented according to the syntax rules outlined. There are no issues with ordering or misused arguments.\n\n4) As the model's output passes all checks without containing any of the discussed issues, we conclude that it correctly fulfills the requirements posed in the user input. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the model's output is correct and functional. It successfully maps the streams without re-encoding them, leading to efficient processing while preserving quality."
