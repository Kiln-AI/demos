  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To accomplish this, you'll use the `\\an` mapping option in `ffmpeg` so that the third audio stream (\\an=2, numbering starts from 0) is included in the output, while the video remains unchanged.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i movie.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:v` maps the video stream from the first stream (index 0) to the output.\n- `-map 0:a:2` maps the third audio stream (index 2, considering 0-based indexing) from the first input stream to the output. The `0:` before `a:2` is necessary to indicate that we are mapping a stream from the first input stream.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding, which is efficient for mapping audio streams.\n- `output.mkv` is the name of the output file.\n\nThis command assumes that the first input stream contains both the video and multiple audio streams, and you want to output a file with the original video and the third audio stream mapped to it.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly maps the third audio stream from the input file while keeping the original video intact, in accordance with the user's request. The command uses `-map` options properly and includes `-c copy` to ensure the streams are copied without re-encoding, which aligns with the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the example of a failing output. In the failing example, the command provided a preset that does not exist (`extra_fast`), leading to a likely runtime error. The command generated by the model correctly follows established syntax and parameters that are recognized by `ffmpeg`, meaning it should work properly without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The mapping specified for video and audio streams is correct (indexing starts from 0), and the `-c copy` option is appropriate for preserving the quality of the streams. The command structure adheres to the guidelines outlined in the man page, ensuring the syntax, option usage, and parameter definitions are valid.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the concern, as it generates a correct and complete `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements precisely. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
