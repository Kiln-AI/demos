  "output": "To extract only the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from a complex MOV file, use stream mapping with the -map option. The streams are zero-indexed, 7th video = v:6 and 14th audio = a:13.\n\n- The -map 0:v:6 option selects the 7th video stream (0-indexed, 0 = first)\n- The -map 0:a:13 option selects the 14th audio stream\n- -c copy performs a lossless/stream-copy (no re-encoding; fastest approach)\n- output.mp4 uses MP4 container which supports both H.264 and AAC most commonly\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The 7th video stream and 14th audio stream exist in the source file\n- You want to keep the original codecs (hence -c copy)\n- MP4 container is acceptable for the output",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Analyzing the command produced by the model, it does not contain any apparent mistakes that would prevent it from executing correctly in FFmpeg. The command follows the correct structure for mapping video and audio streams, and no unsupported or incorrect options are used. Thus, the output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model correctly utilizes valid options, and there are no known issues with the options used (like the non-existent preset `extra_fast` in the failure example). The use of `-map` for selecting video and audio streams is also appropriate.\n\n3) Evaluating against the man page for FFmpeg, the command adheres to all requirements. The `-map` options are appropriately utilized to select the specified video and audio streams, and `-c copy` ensures a lossless copy. There are no violations of the man page specifications.\n\n4) Considering all analyses, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a valid command that meets the user's requirements and adheres to the specifications dictated in the FFmpeg man page. Therefore, it should pass on this evaluation."
