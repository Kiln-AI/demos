  "input": "Convert my video using a bitrate of 25000k for video and 320k for audio to balance quality and size.",
  "output": "To convert your video with a fixed bitrate of 25,000k for video and 320k for audio, you should specify the target video and audio bitrate in ffmpeg options. Both libx264 (H.264) and AAC (audio) accept hard bitrate parameters for constant quality or size control.\n\n- -b:v 25000k sets the constant bitrate for the video stream to 25 Mbps.\n- -maxrate 25000k limits the maximum bitrate (recommended to avoid bitrate spikes exceeding your budget).\n- -bufsize 10000k sets the buffer size for bitrate control; 4x target bitrate is a typical starting value.\n- -b:a 320k sets the constant audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- -c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding.\n- -c:a aac uses AAC audio encoding (high quality, widely compatible).\n- -movflags +faststart moves MP4 moov atom to the start for web streaming.\n\nAssumption: Output should be an MP4 with faststart enabled (suitable for online playback).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 10000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nAdjust input.mp4 and output.mp4 to your filenames if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output seems to meet the user's request for a conversion with specific bitrates for both video and audio. The command correctly specifies the video bitrate (`-b:v 25000k`), the audio bitrate (`-b:a 320k`), and utilizes appropriate codecs (`-c:v libx264` for video and `-c:a aac` for audio). It also includes a control mechanism to handle bitrate spikes (`-maxrate` and `-bufsize`). All relevant parameters are in line with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the provided example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is complete and employs valid options that are consistent with the requirements and standard practices in using the ffmpeg command line tool.\n\n3) As per the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The options used (`-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, and `-movflags`) are valid and appropriate for the specified task. The order of options is also respected, with all input/output specifications properly formulated.\n\n4) Given that the model's output does not contain any issues, and the command is well-formed and consistent with user requests and standard ffmpeg usage, it passes the evaluation."
