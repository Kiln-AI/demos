  "output": "To convert your 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset and copy the audio stream without re-encoding, you want:\n\n1. Scale the video to 1080p instead of 720p (taller resolution).\n2. Use H.264 video codec with the veryslow preset for high-quality encoding.\n3. Copy the audio stream directly with `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding.\n4. Set `-movflags +faststart` so the MP4 is optimized for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf scale=-2:1080` resizes height to 1080, width auto-scales proportionally.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes video with H.264 codec.\n- `-preset veryslow` optimizes for the best quality, slower encoding.\n- `-crf 23` a decent quality setting.\n- `-c:a copy` avoids audio re-encoding.\n- `-movflags +faststart` helps playback start before the entire file is downloaded.\n\nAssumptions: Your source file is named `input.mp4`. Adjust the input/output names as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's request to convert a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset and to copy the audio stream without re-encoding. All specified options are valid and correctly implemented according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The generated command (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4`) uses valid options and parameters, confirming that the preset \"veryslow\" does exist and is implemented correctly.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. All options used are valid according to the options listed, including video scaling with `-vf scale=-2:1080`, selecting a video codec with `-c:v libx264`, and copying the audio with `-c:a copy`.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, the evaluation passes, as the model generated a correct and valid `ffmpeg` command."
