  "output": "To convert a video to MP4 using the HEVC codec with the veryslow preset, I'll use the libx265 encoder which provides excellent compression efficiency. The veryslow preset will prioritize maximum compression over encoding speed.\n\n- `-c:v libx265` uses the HEVC/H.265 video codec\n- `-preset veryslow` applies the slowest preset for maximum compression efficiency\n- `-crf 28` sets a reasonable quality level for HEVC (can be adjusted between 20-32)\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio codec for MP4 compatibility\n- `-tag:v hvc1` ensures proper HEVC tagging for broader device compatibility\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a aac -tag:v hvc1 output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: I assumed you want to maintain the original audio and that the input filename follows a standard format. The encoding will be significantly slower due to the veryslow preset, but will achieve maximum compression efficiency.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is syntactically correct and matches the user requirements for converting a video to MP4 using the hevc codec with the veryslow preset for maximum compression.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated uses valid parameters and options. It does not contain a preset that does not exist, like the `extra_fast` preset in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are valid and consistent with the expected parameters of FFmpeg, including the video codec (libx265), preset (veryslow), CRF value, audio codec, and tagging for HEVC.\n\n4) Given that the command does not contain any issues, it should be evaluated as passing."
