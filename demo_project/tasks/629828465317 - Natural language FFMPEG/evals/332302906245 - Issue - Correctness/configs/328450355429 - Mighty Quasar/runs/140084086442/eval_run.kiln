  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract PNG frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds at the highest resolution, we use the `-vsync 0` and `-vf fps=1/2` options to control the frame extraction rate, and specify `image2` with `png` as the output format.\n\n- `-vf fps=1/2` extracts one frame every 2 seconds.\n- `-vsync 0` ensures that FFmpeg does not duplicate or drop frames during the process, for precise timing.\n- `image2` is the default format for image sequences.\n- `frame_%04d.png` names the extracted files sequentially with zero-padded numbering.\n\nFFmpeg will use the original video resolution unless specific scaling is required (e.g., if you wanted a different resolution). Since you requested \"ultra high resolution\", we assume you want the frames as close to the original videoâ€™s resolution as possible.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=1/2\" -vsync 0 frame_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain an issue as it produces a valid ffmpeg command that correctly meets the user's requirements. The command extracts frames from the specified video every two seconds and saves them as PNG images at the original resolution, adhering to the user's input. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced is correct and valid according to ffmpeg syntax. There are no invalid parameters or incorrect command structure in the output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not violate any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-i` option for input file specification, applies the `-vf fps=1/2` for frame extraction at a two-second interval, and does not specify any conflicting options. It is in line with the general rules of option application and order.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   **Pass**: The model's output does not contain the issue described; the command is correct and fulfills the user's request."
