  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the original video stream and only map the third audio stream from the input, use `-map` options accordingly. `-map 0:v` will include all video streams, and `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (indexing from zero). \n\nAssuming you want to keep the original video quality and codec (not re-encoding), you can use `-c:v copy` to copy video directly, and specify the audio stream you want with `-c:a copy` for that specific stream, or re-encode for compatibility. Here, I'll copy both video and the selected audio stream.\n\n- `-map 0:v` copies all video streams, or you can specify a particular stream if needed.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis keeps the video as-is and includes only the third audio stream in the output.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model correctly implements the mapping of video and audio streams as per user requirements without any functional errors.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The generated command does not contain any invalid options like the nonexistent `extra_fast` preset; instead, it uses valid `-map` and `-c copy` options.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The command is correctly structured, following the syntax rules, and uses valid options (`-map`, `-c`, etc.) for stream mapping and copying.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and therefore should be evaluated as **passing**."
