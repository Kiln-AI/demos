  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 with the fastest encoding, use libx264 with the ultrafast preset (which corresponds to very fast but lower compression efficiency), often referred to as \"rocket\" speed. \"rocket\" isn't an official ffmpeg preset, but \"ultrafast\" is the fastest available.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The \"rocket\" preset refers to `-preset ultrafast`.\n- Output video needs to be playable as a standard MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast` sets fastest encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio to AAC at standard 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart` helps with progressive streaming in browsers.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   \n   No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and matches the requirements stated in the user input: transcoding `video.webm` to MP4 format using `libx264` with the `ultrafast` preset for the fastest encoding. All parameters and options included are valid and appropriate for the task.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   \n   No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) uses valid presets and options. The \"rocket\" reference was addressed correctly by using `-preset ultrafast`, which is an official ffmpeg preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   \n   No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options were used correctly and are in accordance with the usage guidelines provided in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   \n   The output does not contain the issue described as it successfully meets the user's request without errors or invalid options. Thus, it should pass based on the evaluation criteria provided."
