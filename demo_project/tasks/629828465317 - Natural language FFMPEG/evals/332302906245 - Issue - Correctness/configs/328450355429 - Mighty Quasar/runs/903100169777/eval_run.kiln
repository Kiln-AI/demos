  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode input.mp4 to AVI format using the VP9 codec with 2-pass encoding, you need to perform two separate ffmpeg commands:\n\n1. **First pass**: Analyze the video and create a stats file without producing the final output.\n2. **Second pass**: Use the stats file to perform high-quality encoding.\n\nMajor points:\n- VP9 is a modern, efficient codec but is not well supported inside AVI containers; however, since you explicitly requested AVI as output, we can still try this. \n- 2-pass encoding improves quality and bitrate accuracy.\n- For VP9 inside AVI, ensure video is compatible since AVI has limitations with modern codecsâ€”it might not be widely playable.\n- Use `libvpx-vp9` codec.\n- Use `-b:v` for specified bitrate (e.g., 0 and `-crf` for quality), but for 2-pass generally `-b:v` is used for bitrate control.\n- For best compatibility with VP9 in AVI, set `-pix_fmt yuv420p10le` for 10-bit, but for example purposes, this will be yuv420p.\n\nAssuming you want a target bitrate of 2 Mbps (`-b:v 2M`), and audio copy to preserve audio since 2-pass is mainly for video quality.\n\n**Note**: Since VP9 in AVI is unusual and can cause compatibility issues, this might lead to a frozen or unplayable file in typical players.\n\n---\n\n### First pass:\n- Generate 2-pass stats file: `ffmpeg ... -an -f null /dev/null`\n\n### Second pass:\n- Full transcode using the stats file to output AVI file.\n\n---\n\n### Commands:\n\n**First pass:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 1 -an -f null /dev/null\n```\n\n**Second pass:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 2 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p -f avi output.avi\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` selects the VP9 encoder.\n- `-b:v 2M` sets a target bitrate of 2 Mbps.\n- `-pass 1` and `-pass 2` are used for 2-pass encoding.\n- `-an` disables audio processing in first pass.\n- `-f null /dev/null` discards the first pass output.\n- `-pass 2` uses the stats file produced during first pass.\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio to avoid resampling.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility (psycho-visual and some players have issues with YUV420P10LE).\n- Output container is AVI (`output.avi`).\n\n---\n\n### Important Note:\nSince AVI generally doesn't support modern codecs well, consider  container better suited for VP9, e.g., WebM or MP4. The above commands demonstrate 2-pass transcoding with re-encoded video using VP9 into AVI as requested.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output generated by the model does have a significant issue with the command for transcoding to AVI using the VP9 codec. While it is technically possible to use VP9 with AVI, it is an uncommon choice that leads to low compatibility with most players. Thus, the first command should produce a playable file, but there is a risk the output AVI file could be unplayable due to codec limitations inherent in the AVI format. Therefore, it fails the requirement to generate a command that works correctly in a practical scenario.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe output is structured correctly, and the commands don't reference invalid options (like the non-existent `extra_fast` preset in the failure example). Instead, the model correctly applies FFmpeg command line syntax. So, it does not closely resemble the provided failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo direct violations concerning syntax or required options are present within the provided commands. The commands follow the correct FFmpeg structure and use valid options for VP9 encoding, creating a valid flow for 2-pass encoding. However, the usage could still be argued as unconventional due to the use of a modern codec (VP9) in the AVI container, which is not well supported. This suggests an inconsistency rather than a direct violation of the command-line requirements.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nOverall, the model's output does contain the issue described in that transcoding to AVI with VP9 is likely to result in compatibility problems with playable files, despite no syntax errors present. Thus, it should fail as it does not meet the practical requirements of the user."
