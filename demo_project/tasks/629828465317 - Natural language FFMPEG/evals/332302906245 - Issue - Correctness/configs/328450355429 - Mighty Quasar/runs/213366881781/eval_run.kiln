  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert the 5.1 surround sound video to stereo audio with the rear channels mixed at 50% volume, we'll use the following ffmpeg command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af \"atempo=1.85,aechannel_layout=stereo,c مختargec-min=-0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:0.5,w=0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:0.5\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `-af` specifies audio filtering.\n* `atempo=1.85` adjusts the pitch of the audio to make it stereo-compatible.\n* `achechannel_layout=stereo` forces the audio to be laid out in a stereo configuration, overwriting the original 5.1 layout.\n* `mixargec-min=-0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:0.5,w=0.5:-0.5,w=0.5:0.5` mixes the rear channels (center and low center) at 50% volume by setting the minimum volume to -0.5 (which is equivalent to 50% of the maximum volume). The `w` specifies the volume ranges for the different channels.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The original video has a 5.1 surround sound audio track with center and low center channels.\n* The `concert.mp4` file is in a format that can be read by ffmpeg (e.g., MP4).\n* The desired output file will have a stereo audio track.\n\nNote: The `atempo=1.85` value may not be perfect for all types of music. If you need more accurate pitch adjustment, you can experiment with different values.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains issues. The produced command has syntax errors and incorrect parameters that do not match any known `ffmpeg` functionality. Specifically, the audio filter specified (`mixargec-min`) does not exist. This command will not work correctly as is.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, the output is similar to the failure example provided. Just like the example where a non-existing preset is used, the parameters in the model's output are incorrectly formatted or incorrect, making the command invalid. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the command breaks multiple requirements. The audio filter options are incorrectly named and formatted, which is not compliant with the `ffmpeg` documentation that defines how to structure commands and use audio filtering. Specifically, `mixargec-min` as shown in the output is incorrect and doesn't match any understood `ffmpeg` filter.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described, as it fails to generate a functional `ffmpeg` command that aligns with user requirements due to incorrect syntax and command structure. Therefore, it should fail the evaluation."
