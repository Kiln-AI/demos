  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility across all devices, it's best to convert the video to H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec inside an MP4 container. These codecs are widely supported by almost all devices and browsers. We'll use these settings:\n\n- `-c:v libx264` to encode video with H.264 codec.\n- `-profile:v high -level 4.0` to ensure broad compatibility.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` to maximize compatibility with players.\n- `-c:a aac` for AAC audio codec.\n- `-movflags +faststart` to make the video start faster when streamed.\n- Keep the original filename as output with `_compatible.mp4` appended.\n\nAssuming your input file is named `input.mp4`.\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output_compatible.mp4\n```\nIf your input file has a different name, replace `input.mp4` accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is correctly formatted and uses valid options, ensuring it should work correctly for converting the video to a compatible format.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not use any invalid options or non-existent presets, unlike the example failure where an invalid preset was used.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page. All options used in the command are valid and correctly formatted according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Final assessment:**  \nBased on the above analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the failing output example, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page for FFmpeg. Therefore, the model's output is correct and should be considered a successful performance on the task."
