  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 from the input file `broadcast.ts`, you can use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include in the output. Stream indexes in ffmpeg are zero-based and accessed using `-map 0:v:10` for the 11th video stream and `-map 0:a:18` for the 19th audio stream (note that `broadcast.ts` is a Transport Stream file, common in broadcast H.264/H.265 content).\n\nIn the following command, we output the combined video and audio as an MPEG-TS stream (to preserve container format compatibility) to a new file `output.ts`. Alternatively, you can re-encode video and audio to a different format (e.g. MP4/H.264+AAC), but by default, the data is copied without re-encoding unless specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 -c copy output.ts\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-map 0:v:10` selects the 11th video stream (0-based index 10).\n- `-map 0:a:18` selects the 19th audio stream (0-based index 18).\n- `-c copy` copies without re-encoding.\n\nIf you want to re-encode to MP4 for better browser compatibility or to keep audio in AAC and video in H.264, you would replace `-c copy` with appropriate encoder options, such as:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -map 0:a:18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nBut if just extracting for streaming or testing without quality loss, the first command is sufficient.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly specifies the streams to be extracted from `broadcast.ts`, using appropriate `-map` options with correct syntax. The choices made in the command do align with user requests, ensuring that the video and audio streams are properly selected.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command it generated does not contain any non-existent parameters or syntax errors like the mentioned `extra_fast` preset. Instead, it uses valid ffmpeg syntax and options.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` for selecting specific streams aligns with the provided documentation, and copying streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`) is a valid operation that adheres to the syntax rules stated.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a correct ffmpeg command that will function as intended based on the user's input. Therefore, the evaluation passes."
