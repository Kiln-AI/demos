  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To reduce the size of `video.mp4`, you have a few key options: reducing the video resolution, lowering the framerate (e.g., from 60fps to 30fps), decreasing the audio bitrate, or adjusting the video bitrate (CRF). Here, I'll help you by using a good trade-off approach: downscale the video resolution, reduce the audio bitrate, and modify the video bitrate.\n\n- `-vf scale=-2:720` scales the video to 720p height, maintaining aspect ratio.\n- `-r 30` limits the frames per second to 30 frames.\n- `-b:v 3000k` sets the video bitrate to 3 megabits per second.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 96k` sets AAC audio bitrate to 96 kbps.\n\nThese parameter choices generally keep the video visually okay and 2-4 times smaller.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=-2:720 -r 30 -b:v 3000k -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart optimized_video.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:  \n- You're okay with 720p video and 30fps (you could scale further or change frame rate as needed).  \n- The original audio should be converted to AAC-96k.  \n- You want to keep the MP4 format and enable fast start for streaming/download compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described in the problem statement. The ffmpeg command generated should work correctly for reducing the size of the video file. It includes valid options that are appropriate for the stated task. The parameters chosen (resolution, framerate, video bitrate, audio bitrate) are sensible for optimizing the file size while maintaining an acceptable quality. Therefore, the command is valid and aligns with the user requirements.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated uses valid options and formats that are correctly applied to the input file and output file. It does not contain any options or presets that are not recognized by ffmpeg (such as `extra_fast`). The model appears to have properly constructed the command.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model adheres to the guidelines specified in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options is respected, the parameters used (`-vf`, `-r`, `-b:v`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, etc.) are all valid and applicable to the functionality of ffmpeg, and they do not conflict with any rules provided in the man page. Each option is applied correctly, maintaining a logical flow in the command syntax, ensuring the command would execute without error.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Since the command generated is functional, follows the man page specifications, and is appropriate for the user-provided task of reducing video size, it does not contain the issue described in the initial evaluation point.\n\n   **Final Evaluation: Pass**"
