  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode SRT subtitles into a MKV container with yellow font color, you can use ffmpeg with the `subtitles` filter. By configuring the filter, you can set the background opacity and color foreground (subtitles). \n\nKey points:\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontColor=yellow,BackOpacity=0'\"` applies yellow subtitles styled in front of the video with transparent background.\n- Ensure you input both `movie.mkv` and `subtitles.srt`.\n- The `backOpacity=0` parameter is added so the subtitles appear always on top (since the backdrop is not used in this case, making it optionally 100).\n- It's best to check the actual fonts supported by ffmpeg and your player, but yellow RGB is `(255, 255, 0)`, which is valid.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontColor=yellow,BackOpacity=0'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command will create a new MKV file with hardcoded subtitles in yellow.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the performance of the model's output based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model generated a command that matches the user's requirements: to hardcode subtitles from `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` with yellow text. The command appears to be logically constructed and addresses the userâ€™s request correctly. Therefore, it does not contain the described issue; it should pass this check.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command produced by the model does not include any non-existent options or parameters. It uses valid ffmpeg syntax. Thus, this check passes.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command generated by the model:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontColor=yellow,BackOpacity=0'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n   ```\n   - The input file is specified correctly with `-i movie.mkv`.\n   - A video filter is used with `-vf` to apply the subtitles.\n   - The subtitles filter syntax is valid, allowing for subtitle styling (in this case, to set the color to yellow).\n   - The audio is copied without re-encoding, which is appropriate given that the user did not request any audio changes.\n   - Lastly, the output file is specified correctly. \n\n   Therefore, this command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page, passing this check as well.\n\n4) **Final Check:**\n   Since the command does not contain any issues, is not similar to a failing output, and adheres to the specifications outlined in the man page, we conclude that the model's output is accurate and fulfills the user's request effectively.\n\n**Evaluation Result:** Pass."
