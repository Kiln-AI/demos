  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from the input file to the output file, use the `-map` option.\n\n- `-map 0:3` selects the video stream from the input file (assuming it's an mkv container).\n- `-map 0:5` selects the audio stream from the input file.\n- `-c copy` is used to copy the streams without re-encoding, assuming the streams are already in a suitable format for the output container (MP4). If re-encoding is needed or desired, you can specify the codecs as in the previous example.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n\n* The video stream at index 3 (0-based indexing) and the audio stream at index 5 are the desired streams.\n* The selected streams are already in a format compatible with the MP4 container and do not need re-encoding. If re-encoding is necessary, additional parameters would be required to specify the desired codecs and settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses `-c copy` to copy them without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated is correct and does not reference any invalid options. It correctly handles stream mapping and copying, and it follows the proper syntax.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax and uses valid options (`-i`, `-map`, `-c copy`) as detailed in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the modelâ€™s output successfully meets the requirements of the task and does not contain any mistakes in the generated ffmpeg command. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
