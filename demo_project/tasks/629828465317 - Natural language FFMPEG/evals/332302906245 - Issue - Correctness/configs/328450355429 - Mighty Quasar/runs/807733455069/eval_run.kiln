  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to rotate their video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, rotating a video in FFmpeg. The rotate filter is the way to go. For 90 degrees clockwise, the filter is rotate=90. But wait, the syntax might be rotate=90, but I need to check if there are any parameters needed. Also, the video orientation might affect the output dimensions. Rotating 90 degrees changes the width and height. So, if the original is 1920x1080, after rotation, it becomes 1080x1920. But maybe the user wants to maintain the aspect ratio? Or maybe just rotate and let the dimensions change. The user didn't specify, so I'll assume they just want the rotation without adjusting dimensions, but maybe need to transpose the video as well. Wait, the rotate filter can handle that. Alternatively, the transpose filter might be used for 90-degree rotations. Let me recall: transpose=1 is 90 degrees clockwise, transpose=2 is 180, transpose=3 is 270. But transpose is for flipping, maybe not exactly rotation. Wait, maybe the rotate filter is more accurate. The rotate filter can take degrees, so rotate=90 is correct. But I need to make sure that the video is rotated properly. Also, if the video is not square, the aspect ratio might change. But the user didn't mention anything about that, so proceed with rotation.\n\nNext, noise reduction. FFmpeg has several noise reduction filters. The most common ones are nlmeans and dnxhd. But which is the strongest? The nlmeans filter is a non-local means filter, which is effective for noise reduction. Also, there's the deinterlaced filter, but that's not noise reduction. Or maybe using the hqdn3d filter, which is a simple denoise filter, but not as strong as nlmeans. However, nlmeans might be more computationally intensive. Since the user wants the strongest filters, maybe using nlmeans with parameters tuned for maximum noise reduction. But the parameters need to be set. The nlmeans filter has parameters like strength, search, and block. The default might not be the strongest, so I need to specify them. For example, strength=0.5 might be a good starting point. But perhaps increasing strength? But too high might remove details. Maybe the optimal values are needed. Alternatively, other filters like \"noise\" filter, but that's more for removing noise in a more brute-force way. However, the noise filter might be less effective than nlmeans. So, using nlmeans with higher parameters. Let me check: the nlmeans filter's parameters are strength, search, and block. For stronger noise reduction, I might set strength to 0.8 or higher. However, this might affect the video quality. Also, the exact parameters might vary, but the user wants the strongest available. So, including the nlmeans filter with parameters like strength=0.8, search=32, block=8. Alternatively, the user might need to experiment with those values. But for the command, I'll include it with the default parameters, or maybe suggest them. Wait, in the example response, the user's answer included specific parameters. So I should include those.\n\nAdditionally, the user might need to make sure that the video is properly scaled after rotation. For example, if the original video is 1920x1080, rotating 90 degrees would make it 1080x1920, which is the same aspect ratio. But if the user wants to maintain the original aspect ratio, perhaps using the scale filter with specific dimensions. However, the user didn't mention scaling, only rotation. So, just rotate and apply noise reduction.\n\nAnother aspect: audio. The user didn't mention audio processing, so assuming the audio remains as is. But it's possible that the noise reduction might affect audio, but the filters mentioned are for video. So, the audio is left untouched. However, if the user wants to also process audio, but the question is about video rotation and noise reduction. So, the command would process the video stream and leave the audio as is.\n\nPutting it all together. The command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90, nlmeans\" output.mp4\n\nBut wait, the nlmeans filter needs to be properly set up. The example I think uses parameters. So, maybe the command should include parameters for nlmeans. For example, strength=0.8, search=32, block=8. But what is the default? Let me check. The default parameters for nlmeans in FFmpeg are strength=0.6, search=40, block=8. So, maybe increasing strength to 0.8 for stronger noise reduction. But the user might need to adjust based on their video. However, the problem says to use the strongest filters available, so perhaps using the highest possible parameters.\n\nWait, but the nlmeans filter might not be the most effective. Alternatively, using a combination of filters. But the user asked for advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available. So, using nlmeans with stronger parameters.\n\nAnother point: the rotate filter might need to be informed about the rotation direction. For example, rotate=90 degrees clockwise is correct. Also, the transpose filter may be useful here. Wait, transpose=1 is rotate 90 degrees clockwise and flip. But that might not be the same as rotate=90. Wait, the difference between the rotate filter and transpose filter. The rotate filter actually rotates the video frame by the given degrees, which can be any angle. The transpose filter swaps the width and height and/or flips the image. For example, transpose=1 rotates 90 degrees clockwise and flips vertically. So, if the user wants to rotate 90 degrees clockwise without flipping, the rotate filter is better. But maybe the transpose filter is simpler. But the user wants the video rotated 90 degrees clockwise. So, the correct approach is to use rotate=90.\n\nSo, the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90, nlmeans=strength=0.8:search=32:block=8\" output.mp4\n\nBut need to check the parameters for nlmeans. The parameters are strength, search, block. So, the syntax for the filter is nlmeans=strength=0.8:search=32:block=8. So, including that.\n\nBut perhaps the user wants the strongest filters available. Maybe using multiple filters? For example, combining nlmeans with other denoising steps. However, in FFmpeg, the nlmeans is a strong filter. Alternatively, the hqdn3d filter, which is a simple denoiser, but not as strong. So, nlmeans is the right choice.\n\nAnother consideration: the output format. The user didn't specify the container, so assuming that the output is in the same format as the input, but if the input is a different container, the output might be mp4 or another. But the user hasn't mentioned that, so leave it as is. Also, the user might want to ensure that the preview is suitable, so maybe adding -movflags +faststart if it's for streaming, but that's not mentioned here. The user's original example included that for streaming, but in this case, the user hasn't mentioned streaming, so perhaps not necessary.\n\nSo, the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90,nlmeans=strength=0.8:search=32:block=8\" output.mp4\n\nBut let me check the correct syntax for the filters. The rotate filter is used with the rotate=angle. The nlmeans filter takes parameters in the format name=value. So the correct syntax is -vf \"rotate=90, nlmeans=strength=0.8:search=32:block=8\". Also, the order of the filters matters. The rotate is applied first, then noise reduction. That's correct.\n\nNow, the explanation: The rotate filter rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise, which changes the dimensions. Then, the nlmeans filter is used for noise reduction with increased strength to maximize noise removal. The parameters strength=0.8, search=32, and block=8 are chosen to balance between noise reduction and preserving detail. The user should adjust these parameters based on the specific video for optimal results.\n\nBut wait, the strength parameter in nlmeans can be up to 1.0. So maybe setting strength=1.0 would be the strongest. However, that might remove too much detail. But the user said \"strongest filters available\", so perhaps maximum strength. But I need to check FFmpeg's documentation. The strength parameter is a float between 0 and 1. So, strength=1.0 would be the maximum. But maybe that's not advisable. However, the user's request is to apply the strongest filters, so perhaps include strength=1.0. But that's a trade-off. Alternatively, using more aggressive parameters. But the exact parameters can vary, so maybe using default values but stating that the user can adjust them. However, the question says to apply the strongest available, so perhaps using maximum strength.\n\nAlternatively, using the noise filter. Wait, the noise filter is more for removing noise in a more crude way, but maybe not as effective as nlmeans. So, sticking with nlmeans.\n\nSo, the final command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90,nlmeans=strength=1.0:search=32:block=8\" output",
