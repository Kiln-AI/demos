  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert `movie.mkv` to MP4 using the `ultrafast` preset (for maximum encoding speed), we'll use H.264 video encoding (common in MP4 containers) and AAC audio (standard for MP4). The `-preset ultrafast` option prioritizes speed over compression efficiency. While no specific resolution or quality is requested, we include `-movflags +faststart` to optimize for web streaming (though it's optional and depends on use case).\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The input file `movie.mkv` uses a compatible audio codec (e.g., AAC, MP3). If not, audio re-encoding may be required.\n- You want to maintain the original resolution and quality unless specified otherwise.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is added for streaming compatibility, but can be omitted if not needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The provided `ffmpeg` command is properly formatted and includes valid options that would allow the conversion of the video file `movie.mkv` to MP4 format. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly uses the `-preset ultrafast` option, which is valid. There are no invalid options like `extra_fast` present in the command.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The order of options is correct, and each option is valid and applicable for the conversion task described.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as the generated command should work correctly and meets the userâ€™s request to convert the video to MP4 format using the `ultrafast` preset. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
