  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to compress their video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main goal is compression with a focus on speed. The hyper preset in ffmpeg is part of the x264 codec's presets, which prioritize speed over compression efficiency. So I should use that.\n\nThey mentioned \"compress\" but the hyper preset might not be the best for compression efficiency. However, the user specifically asked for hyper preset, so I should follow that. Maybe they need the video to be processed quickly, even if the compression isn't optimal.\n\nI need to set the preset to hyper. The default codec for video is usually libx264, so I'll stick with that. The user didn't specify a target size, so I should use a reasonable CRF value. A CRF of 23 is standard for a good balance, but if they want smaller size, maybe 24 or higher. However, since they want fast processing, maybe a higher CRF is acceptable. Wait, CRF doesn't directly relate to speed. The preset does. So maybe they just want the fastest encoding, regardless of the output size. So keeping CRF at 23 is safe.\n\nAudio codec isn't mentioned. The default might be aac, but maybe I should specify it to ensure consistency. Also, the output format is mp4, which is common. They didn't mention audio bitrate, so using the default for aac is okay. \n\nThey might not need to change the resolution, so keep the original. But maybe they want to maintain compatibility, so yuv420p is a good choice. Also, adding -movflags +faststart could help with streaming, but the user didn't mention that. However, since they're compressing, maybe they plan to stream it later. Including that as an option might be helpful.\n\nSo the command would include -preset hyper, libx264, crf 23, maybe aac audio, and movflags. Also, check if the user wants to specify the output file name. They said \"compress video.mov\", so the output could be video_compressed.mp4. \n\nI should structure the command with these parameters. Let me put it all together.\n</think>\n\nTo compress `video.mov` using the `hyper` preset for maximum encoding speed, we use the `libx264` codec with the fastest preset. The `hyper` preset prioritizes speed over compression efficiency, making it ideal for rapid processing. A standard CRF (Constant Rate Factor) of 23 is used for balanced quality, and `aac` audio is retained for compatibility. The output is saved as `video_compressed.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 23 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart video_compressed.mp4\n```\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `-preset hyper`: Enables ultra-fast encoding at the cost of compression efficiency.\n- `-crf 23`: Sets quality (lower = higher quality; 23 is a default balance).\n- `-c:a aac`: Retains AAC audio for broad compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Optimizes MP4 files for web streaming by moving metadata to the start.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated appears to be valid and correctly structured based on the user's request to compress the video with certain parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it provided (`ffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 23 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart video_compressed.mp4`) uses a valid preset (`hyper`), which is an existing option in x264. Therefore, it does not present a similar issue.\n\n3) According to the man page for ffmpeg, the command constructed by the model does not violate any requirements. The order of options and the syntax used are correct. All specified options are valid and applicable to the input and output files as described in the input.\n\n4) Since the command is valid and does not contain issues regarding the requirements, it should pass the evaluation. The model successfully created a command that meets the user's request, ensuring both accuracy and adherence to ffmpeg's command structure."
