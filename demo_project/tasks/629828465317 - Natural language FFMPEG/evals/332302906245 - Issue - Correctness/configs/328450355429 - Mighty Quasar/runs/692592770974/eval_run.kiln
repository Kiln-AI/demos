  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert a video from MKV to MP4 with 4K resolution and compress it for email attachment, we need to use appropriate codecs and encoding settings. H.264 video and AAC audio are widely supported and efficient for compression. Setting a high CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value like 28 will reduce file size significantly while maintaining acceptable visual quality. The -preset parameter can be set to \"ultrafast\" to prioritize encoding speed over compression efficiency, which is useful when size is more important than speed.\n\nNote: 4K resolution typically refers to 3840Ã—2160 pixels. If the original video is already 4K, this command will preserve it. If not, it will upscale to 4K, which could affect quality and file size. Also, the -movflags +faststart option is not necessary for general compression but helps with streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 64k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues that align with the concerns raised in the issue description. The generated command is appropriate for converting the specified input format and follows the user's requirements for output format and resolution. It also adequately prioritizes file size reduction.\n\n2) The output from the model is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not use a non-existent preset. Instead, it uses a valid preset (\"ultrafast\") which is recognized by `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) Evaluating against the `ffmpeg` man page, the command does not break any requirements. The options are used correctly, such as specifying the input file, scale to the desired resolution, codecs, and bitrate for audio. All options are appropriate and comply with the commands described in the man page.\n\n4) Since there are no issues in the command, it does not contain the described issue and therefore, the evaluation passes. The command generated is both appropriate for the transformation specified and adheres to the required syntax and options valid within the `ffmpeg` framework."
