  "input": "Please convert video.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast preset",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast encoding preset, you should set the -preset superfast option. This increases encoding speed while slightly reducing compression efficiency (bigger files/lower quality per bitrate) compared to slower presets. H.264 is specified via -c:v libx264, and AAC audio is used for broad compatibility. The -preset superfast option and -movflags +faststart for fast streaming are recommended.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart video.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Default quality (CRF 23) is acceptable. Adjust as needed for bitrate/visual quality tradeoff.\n- Audio encoded to AAC at 128 kbps for compatibility.\n- Metadata is placed at start for fast streamability.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output specifically mentions using the `libx264` codec with the `superfast` preset and includes the `-movflags +faststart` option to ensure fast streaming. Each part of the command adheres to requirements specified in the user message without any mistakes in command format or parameter values. Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The output does not contain an erroneous preset or flag that does not exist, such as `extra_fast`, which would fail. Instead, it correctly identifies and uses `-preset superfast`, which is a valid preset option in `ffmpeg`. Thus, this output is not similar to the failure example provided.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the command generated by the model correctly follows the proper syntax and structure for `ffmpeg` commands. The order is respected (input file -> options -> output file). The use of `-c:v libx264`, `-preset superfast`, `-c:a aac`, and `-movflags +faststart` is compliant with the standard requirements. As such, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the reported issues, it successfully meets the criteria described in the task. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
