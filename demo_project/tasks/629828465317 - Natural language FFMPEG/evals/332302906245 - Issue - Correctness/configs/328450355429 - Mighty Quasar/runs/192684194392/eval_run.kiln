  "output": "To extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3, I'll use the MP3 encoder with maximum bitrate (320 kbps), which is the highest quality setting for MP3 format.\n\n- `-vn` disables video stream processing (audio only)\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` uses the LAME MP3 encoder (highest quality MP3 encoder in ffmpeg)\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (maximum for MP3)\n- `-q:a 0` sets the highest quality setting for the LAME encoder (scale 0-9, where 0 is best)\n\nI'm assuming you want the entire audio track extracted. If the source has multiple audio streams, this will extract the first one by default.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 output.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated will work correctly to extract audio from the video file and save it as a high-quality MP3 file at maximum bitrate, consistent with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, as the command generated contains valid parameters and options for the `ffmpeg` tool. There are no incorrect options present that would lead to a failure.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. All the options used (`-vn`, `-c:a libmp3lame`, `-b:a 320k`, `-q:a 0`) are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation, and they serve the purpose of extracting audio in MP3 format at a high bitrate.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the model's performance on this task meets the requirements accurately, and there are no identified issues with the command generated."
