  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To encode your video at an 8000k bitrate and ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality, you can use the following command. \n\nWe will use H.264 for video encoding and AAC for audio encoding, as these codecs are widely supported. We'll also set the video bitrate to 8000k and the audio bitrate to 2048k.\n\nAssuming the input file is input.mp4 and the output file is output.mp4, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -c:a aac -b:a 2048k output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes your audio is in a format that can be converted to AAC with a bitrate as high as 2048k. Also, your input video is input.mp4 and the output file will be output.mp4 in the same directory.\n\nNote that using a high bitrate for video (8000k) will result in a larger file size and may not be necessary for all use cases, but we've implemented it as per your request. For most use cases, bitrates between 1000k and 5000k are considered sufficient for high-quality video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly specifies the video and audio codecs, sets the desired bitrates, and assumes appropriate input and output file names. There are no errors in the command given the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model contains valid parameters and does not reference any nonexistent options or incorrect syntax. It is a functional command that would execute successfully given valid input files.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All parameters used, including codecs and bit rates, are in accordance with the documented options. There is no use of deprecated options, and the correct format for specifying bitrates is followed. \n\n4) Since the model's output meets the criteria required for the task, it passes the evaluation. The command is well-formed and matches the user's request without issues."
