  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress video.mp4 using the maximum efficiency preset and save storage space, use the libx264 video codec with the veryslow preset (offers the best compression efficiency but is slower), and enable variables like: te te, set video quality to a sane default, and copy audio from the original file.\n\n- te te enables te, for maximum speed preset with least efficiency chosen which should be veryslow \n- crf sets quality (lower is better), 23 is a good default value\n- -maxrate and -bufsize should be specified together, the -maxrate is used to restrict bitrate for scaling speed\n- preset veryslow focuses on compression efficiency over encoding speed. Use `fast` to invert that priority\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding\n- c:a copy re-encodes nothing in the audio file (reduces extra processing load at relatively little effect)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -te te -crf 23 -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1200k -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. Firstly, the option `-te te` is incorrect and doesn't make sense in this context. There is no `-te` option in ffmpeg. Secondly, the sentence mentions \"maximum efficiency preset\" but refers to the `veryslow` preset, which might not be what the user intended as maximum efficiency. It also fails to explain the use of `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` correctly in the context of compression.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example provided. The use of `-te te` indicates a misunderstanding of ffmpeg's command structure, just as `-preset extra_fast` was incorrect in the failure example.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break requirements dictated in the man page as it includes invalid options like `-te te`. Additionally, while `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` are valid options, their application without proper context is misleading. The command does not follow the expected syntax and order of parameters as described in the man page of ffmpeg. \n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output contains significant issues that lead it to fail in generating a correct and valid ffmpeg command for the task at hand."
