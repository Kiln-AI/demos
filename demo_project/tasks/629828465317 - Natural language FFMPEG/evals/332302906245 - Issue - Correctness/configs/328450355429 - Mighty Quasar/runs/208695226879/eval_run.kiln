  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To create a video with maximum compatibility across all devices, use H.264 Baseline profile with AAC audio, conservative settings, and widely supported parameters.\n\nThe Baseline profile (profile:v baseline) is the most compatible H.264 profile, supported by older devices, mobile phones, and basic players. Level 3.0 ensures compatibility with older hardware. The yuv420p pixel format is universally supported, and the conservative CRF of 23 balances quality with file size. AAC audio at 128kbps with a 44.1kHz sample rate works on all devices.\n\nKey compatibility settings:\n- `-profile:v baseline -level 3.0` for maximum H.264 compatibility\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for universal color format support\n- `-movflags +faststart` for web/streaming compatibility\n- `-ar 44100` sets standard audio sample rate\n- Conservative bitrates and settings to work on low-power devices\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -crf 23 -maxrate 2M -bufsize 4M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 2 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes you want MP4 output format (most universal). The maxrate and bufsize parameters prevent bitrate spikes that might cause issues on slower devices or connections.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command generated matches the user requirements for maximum compatibility settings with correct options applied.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not include any non-existent options or incorrectly specified parameters, and all options used are valid and appropriate for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used are correctly applied to the output file, and the commandâ€™s structure follows the expected syntax for `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the model's output does not contain any issues and thus should pass evaluation for generating a valid and correct `ffmpeg` command."
