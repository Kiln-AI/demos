  "input": "Convert video.mov to MP4 format with lossless compression but also apply heavy compression to reduce file size",
  "output": "To convert video.mov to MP4 format applying both lossless and heavy compression, you must understand that \"lossless\" and \"heavy compression\" represent opposing goals. By its nature, heavy compression means lossy compression, which sacrifices quality for file size. To balance them, you'd use lossless compression for video and lossy but highly efficient compression for audio (since lossless audio for MP4 is rarely supported and impractical).\n\nFor video, use the libx264 with CRF (Constant Rate Factor); a lower CRF (e.g., 18) gives high quality, while a higher one (e.g., 28–30) drastically reduces size at noticeable visual loss. For truly lossless video within the MP4 container, use ffv1 or H.264 lossless, but lossless inside MP4 has limitations (high bitrate and broad compatibility).\n\nHere, I'll show you how to use lossless video (H.264 lossless, which is widely supported) with AAC lossy audio for practical use. Then, I'll show you strong lossy compression as an alternative—this is generally what's used for file size reduction.\n\n**Lossless (H.264 lossless) Video with Lossy Audio:**\n- -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 0 uses lossless H.264 encoding.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k compresses audio to a reasonable size.\n\n```\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 0 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart lossless_output.mp4\n```\n\nAlternatively,\n\n**Heavy Lossy Compression (H.264 at CRF 30 for maximal size reduction):**\n- -crf 30 achieves very high compression with visibly degraded quality.\n- -preset veryslow favors compression efficiency (lower file size).\n- Audio is still AAC at 128k.\n\n```\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 30 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart compressed_output.mp4\n```\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- For lossless video with good compatibility, H.264 lossless (-crf 0) is the best choice, but note lossless in MP4 limits performance and filesize.\n- For maximum file size reduction, use a lossy CRF value (e.g., 30); lower number is better quality.\n- In general, applying both true lossless and \"heavy\" compression to a single stream isn't supported—you must choose one approach. Thus, typically \"lossless\" for video while \"compressed\" audio achieves a reasonable balance.\n\nAssumption: You want broadly compatible MP4 for playback using standard players and browsers.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue as described in the issue description. The user request to apply both lossless and heavy compression in an MP4 format presents contradictory goals. The model correctly noted that lossless compression generally conflicts with heavy compression, and thus it suggested two commands: one for lossless video and lossy audio, and the other for heavy lossy compression. However, it didn’t strictly address the user's request by providing a single command that achieves what the user wants. Instead, it provided two separate commands without clarifying that the user needs to choose one approach.\n\n2) The model's output does not contain a failing example similar to the one provided. The commands generated by the model are valid and do not use any incorrect syntax or nonexistent presets, unlike the `preset extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated by the man page for FFmpeg. Both commands are syntactically correct and follow the acceptable format for specifying input and output options.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation, the model's output can be marked as failing because it did not fulfill the user's request properly. The user wanted both lossless and heavy compression applied in one command, but the model offered two separate commands that do not satisfy that aspect. Thus, it does contain the issue described."
