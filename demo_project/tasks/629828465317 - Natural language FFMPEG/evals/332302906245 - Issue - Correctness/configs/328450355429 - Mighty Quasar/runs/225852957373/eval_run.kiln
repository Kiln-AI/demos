  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility across all devices, the best choice is to convert your video to an MP4 container using H.264 video codec (libx264) and AAC audio codec, as these are almost universally supported. \n\nAlso, using the pixel format yuv420p ensures compatibility with older devices. The preset medium balances encoding speed and quality, and the CRF 23 offers a good quality-to-size balance. The -movflags +faststart option makes the file web-streaming friendly by moving the metadata to the beginning.\n\nAssuming your input filename is \"input.ext\" and output is \"output.mp4\":\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated by the model is valid and aligns with the user's request to ensure maximum compatibility across all devices using universally supported codecs. The command includes appropriate settings, such as using the H.264 codec for video (libx264) and AAC for audio, which are indeed widely supported.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command is correctly structured and does not reference any non-existent presets, such as `extra_fast`. The `-preset medium` used in the command is a valid option and exists in the ffmpeg preset list. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the ordering rules of ffmpeg commands and properly specifies the input and output files, along with the correct options. All options used are standard and recognized within the ffmpeg documentation.\n\nBased on these evaluations, the model's output passes all checks and effectively meets the user's request."
