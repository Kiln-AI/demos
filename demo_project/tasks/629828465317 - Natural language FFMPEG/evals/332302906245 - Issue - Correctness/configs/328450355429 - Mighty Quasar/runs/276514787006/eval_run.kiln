  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode (burn-in) the subtitles from `subtitles.srt` into the video stream of `movie.mkv`, you can use the `subtitles` filter in ffmpeg. To set the color of the subtitles to yellow, you need to modify the subtitle rendering options. The most reliable way is to explicitly style the subtitles with the desired color via the filter options.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The `.srt` file uses standard subtitle format.\n- You want to preserve the original audio and video codecs, but re-encode as needed for the filter to apply.\n- Output will be `.mkv` as well (but can be changed if desired).\n\nThe color yellow in ASS/SSA format is `&H00FFFF00` (BBGGRR in hex, with `&H00` as alpha), or in standard RGB: `full opacity, red=255, green=255, blue=0`. For SRT, the filter’s `force_style` sets color as `&H00FFFF00` for yellow.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'\" -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast output_with_yellow_subs.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation of options:\n\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'\"`: Burns in the subtitles with the primary color set to yellow.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast`: Re-encodes the video with high quality and decent speed.\n\nChange the output filename or codec/preset as needed for your workflow.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command appropriately hardcodes subtitles into the video and sets the color as requested by the user. The command syntax is also valid, adhering to the expected structure for `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does not include any non-existent options (like `-preset extra_fast`), but rather uses valid and recognized `ffmpeg` options and parameters.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the command against the man page, it does not break any specified requirements. All options used in the command are valid, and the syntax is followed correctly. The options are ordered correctly, and the necessary components for input and output are included.\n\n4) Considering the above, the output passes the evaluation criteria—it does not contain any issues, utilizes valid options, and follows the requirements dictated in the man page. Therefore, the command generated by the model can be considered correctly functioning according to the user's request."
