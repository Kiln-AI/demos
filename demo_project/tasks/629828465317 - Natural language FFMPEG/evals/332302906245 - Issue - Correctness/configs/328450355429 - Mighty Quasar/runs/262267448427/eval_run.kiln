  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you can use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n- `-i video.mp4`: This specifies the input file.\n- `-acodec flac`: This specifies the audio codec to use, which in this case is FLAC.\n- `-compression_level maximum`: This sets the compression level to maximum for FLAC, ensuring the highest level of compression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -acodec flac -compression_level maximum output.flac\n```\n\nThis command will extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as `output.flac` with maximum compression. Note that the `-compression_level maximum` option is specific to the FLAC codec and is used to ensure the highest compression possible.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command `-compression_level maximum` is incorrect because the correct flag for setting the compression level for FLAC in FFmpeg is `-compression_level` followed by a number from 0 to 12, with 12 being the maximum compression level. \"maximum\" is not a valid input.\n\n2) No, the model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. In the failure example, the command used a non-existent preset `extra_fast`, while in this case, the command format is correct, but it uses an invalid argument for an existing option.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks the requirements dictated in the man page. The flag `-compression_level maximum` is not valid as \"maximum\" is not a number within the expected range for the compression level of the FLAC codec.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output does contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command it generated will not work correctly because it does not adhere to the necessary syntax for setting the compression level for FLAC audio extraction in FFmpeg. Therefore, it fails the evaluation."
