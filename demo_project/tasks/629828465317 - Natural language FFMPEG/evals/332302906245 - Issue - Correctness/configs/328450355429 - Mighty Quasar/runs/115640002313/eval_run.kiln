  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a file with multiple tracks, you can use the `-map` option with the stream index.\n\nAssuming you want to copy the selected streams without re-encoding, use the `-c` option with `copy` as the codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nHere, `0:v:15` selects the 16th video stream (streams are 0-indexed), and `0:a:22` selects the 23rd audio stream. The `0:` prefix refers to the input file index (in this case, the only input file).\n\nNote that if you want to re-encode the selected streams, you'll need to specify codecs and other encoding options instead of using `-c copy`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that selects video stream 15 and audio stream 22 from the input file. It uses the `-map` option appropriately to specify the desired streams. There are no mistakes in the command generation, and the output matches the userâ€™s requirements accurately. Therefore, it does **not** contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output provided. The command is valid, does not contain any incorrect options, and uses valid syntax. \n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements set forth in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly maps the input streams and applies the copy codec for both video and audio streams, which is permissible in the context given by the user. Therefore, the command does not break any requirements detailed in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, and it successfully meets the user's request. Thus, the evaluation passes."
