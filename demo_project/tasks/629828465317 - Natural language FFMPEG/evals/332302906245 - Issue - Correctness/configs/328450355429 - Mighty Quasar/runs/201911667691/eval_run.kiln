  "input": "Convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound using the cinema_quality preset and save as WAV",
  "output": "To convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound, we'll use the `ffmpeg` audio filter `pan` with cinema_quality preset (`-preset cinema_quality`). The 7.1 layout requires 8 channels (FL, FR, FC, LFE, BL, BR, SL, SR), so we'll map the stereo channels appropriately and generate the remaining channels.\n\nWe'll:\n- Use `-ac 8` to output 8 channels for 7.1 surround\n- Use `aformat=channel_layouts=7.1` to ensure proper channel ordering\n- Use `pan=7.1` filter to route stereo L/R to multiple channels (front left/right) and duplicate to create fill channels\n- Use `-preset cinema_quality` which prioritizes audio quality preservation\n- Output as WAV (uncompressed, high quality)\n\nNote: This creates artificial 7.1 by duplicating content to surround channels. For proper upmixing, more sophisticated tools would be needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_stereo.wav -preset cinema_quality -af \"pan=7.1|FL=c0|FR=c1|FC=0.5*c0+0.5*c1|LFE=0.5*c0+0.5*c1|BL=0.5*c0|BR=0.5*c1|SL=0.5*c0|SR=0.5*c1,aformat=channel_layouts=7.1\" -ac 8 output_7.1.wav\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command appears to be valid and correctly addresses the user's request to convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound using the appropriate parameters and techniques. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model does not include any references to non-existing presets or invalid options. The use of `-preset cinema_quality` suggests it is valid as it matches standard audio processing practices.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used (like `-preset`, `-ac`, `-af`, etc.) are appropriate for audio processing in ffmpeg.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the command is valid and meets the user's requirements without any errors or invalid syntax. Therefore, the response should pass as it correctly follows the task instructions and utilizes valid ffmpeg commands."
