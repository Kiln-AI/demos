  "input": "I want to apply a complex video filter chain to add a watermark and adjust brightness. Use -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' to resize, add watermark, and brighten the video.",
  "output": "You're asking to apply a series of video filters to a video, including resizing, adding a watermark, and adjusting brightness. The `-vf` option allows you to specify a filter chain. I'll break down the filters used and explain the parameters. I assume you have a watermark image named \"watermark.png\" in the same directory as the input video.\n\n- `scale=1280:720` resizes the video to 1280x720 pixels.\n- `overlay=10:10:watermark.png` overlays the \"watermark.png\" image onto the video, starting at the coordinates (10, 10).\n- `brightness=0.2` increases the brightness of the video by 0.2.  A positive value increases brightness, and a negative value decreases it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2\" output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and matches the user requirements for applying a filter chain to resize, add a watermark, and adjust brightness. Thus, it should pass this evaluation step.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is correctly formed and uses valid ffmpeg options. The example of a failing output contains references to a non-existing preset, while this command accurately uses the appropriate filters without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax used is correct, and all options specified are valid as per the documented ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
