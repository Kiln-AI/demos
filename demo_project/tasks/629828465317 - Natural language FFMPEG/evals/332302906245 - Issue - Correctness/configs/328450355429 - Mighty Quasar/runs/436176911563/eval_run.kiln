Use the `fast` encode preset for efficiency and quality settings that optimize for broad playback compatibility.\n\n- scale -2:720 for 720p at right aspect ratio.\n- crf 23 balances quality and file size.\n- -movflags +faststart ensures fast progressive playback.\n- -c:v libx264 and -c:a aac for universal codec support.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p for device compatibility.\n  \n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -vf \"scale=-2:720,format=yuv420p\" -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any mistakes in the ffmpeg command it generates in relation to the user's request. The command includes all necessary components to ensure maximum compatibility across devices. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example given. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -vf \"scale=-2:720,format=yuv420p\" -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) is syntactically correct and utilizes existing parameters and options without errors. \n\n3) The command breaks no requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, utilizes valid options and parameters, and maintains the required output format.\n\n4) Since the command provided by the model is valid, properly structured, and aligns well with the user's request and the FFmpeg guidelines, I would conclude that the model's output is satisfactory. Thus, it passes the evaluation criteria."
