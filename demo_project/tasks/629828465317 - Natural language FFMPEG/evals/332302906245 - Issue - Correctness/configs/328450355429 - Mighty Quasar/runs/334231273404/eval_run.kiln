  "input": "Extract frames from video.mp4 every 5 seconds and save as PNG images using the lossless preset",
  "output": "To extract frames every 5 seconds, we use the `-vf fps=1/5` filter which takes one frame every 5 seconds. For PNG output with lossless quality, PNG by default is lossless, so no special preset is needed beyond specifying the PNG format. The output filename should include a pattern like `%04d.png` to save sequential images.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=1/5 frame_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output successfully meets the requirements laid out in the user's input. It correctly specifies extracting frames every 5 seconds and saving the frames as PNG images with a proper filename pattern for sequential numbering. The use of `-vf fps=1/5` is appropriate for achieving this frame extraction at 5-second intervals, aligning with user specifications.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command constructed by the model is valid and adheres to the requirements stated in the user's input; there is no mention of a non-existent preset or conflicting parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The parameters used are correct for the intended function—extracting frames and saving them in a specified format.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It correctly generates a functional command based on the user’s request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
