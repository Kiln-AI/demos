  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "If you want both H.264 and H.265 versions of the same video in a single output file, you need a format that supports multiple video streams. The Matroska (.mkv) container is ideal for this purpose. You can use ffmpegâ€™s stream mapping to encode your input into both codecs and include both streams in one MKV.\n\n- -map 0:v:0 -c:v:0 libx264 encodes the first video stream in H.264.\n- -map 0:v:0 -c:v:1 libx265 encodes the same video again in H.265.\n- -map 0:a? -c:a copy includes all original audio streams unchanged (assuming you want to copy audio).\n- The output file will have two selectable video streams: one H.264, one H.265.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:0 -c:v:0 libx264 -map 0:v:0 -c:v:1 libx265 -map 0:a? -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nYou can select which video stream to play in compatible players like VLC or with ffmpeg in later processing.\n\nAssumptions:\n- input.mp4 is your source file; change as needed.\n- All audio streams are copied, not re-encoded. If you want to encode audio as well, specify -c:a accordingly.\n- If your file contains subtitles or other streams you want to keep, add corresponding -map and -c options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The `ffmpeg` command it generated appears to be valid for producing an output file with both H.264 and H.265 streams. The explanation provided aligns with the user's request. Therefore, it passes this check.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated does not feature a syntax or codec error that would cause it to fail as shown in the example. The command structure and options used are appropriate for achieving the desired outcome of encoding in two codecs simultaneously.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command generated adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option for specifying the input streams and their corresponding output streams. Additionally, it properly handles the multiple codecs within a single output file, using the `-c:v` option for assigning codecs to the video streams. Therefore, it passes this check as well.\n\nBased on the evaluations above, the output does not contain issues, is not similar to the examples of failing outputs, and conforms to the man page requirements. Thus, the performance of the model on this task is satisfactory."
