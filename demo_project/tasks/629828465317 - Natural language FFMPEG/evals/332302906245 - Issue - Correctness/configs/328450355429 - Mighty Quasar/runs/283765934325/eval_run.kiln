  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream file using `ffmpeg`, you can use the `-map` option. Here's the command to extract the 3rd video stream (index 3) and the 5th audio stream (index 5) from your file source.mkv and output them into a new file called edited.mp4:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copiesource.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions: \n\n- In this command, the numbers in `-map` refer to the stream index. The first two numbers (0:0) would define the source file and the first stream (video) from it. I assumed stream numbers start from 0, even for audio streams from the same file.\n- The `-c copies` specifies that whatever codec is transferred, should be copied without re-encoding, saving bandwidth. If you need to re-encode the extracted streams as well, use `-c:v` and `-c:a` instead of `-c`. However, using `-c` without a codec will cause an error since we are trying to extract streams that can't be re-encoded by default.\n- `_source.mkv` was used here to explicitly mention the necessary input file in the command to ensure clarity. In a real-world usage, `-map` usually only specifies the input stream selection.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy edited.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The generated command (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copiesource.mkv`) is incorrect. The syntax used for the codec copy option (`-c copiesource.mkv`) is wrong, as it should specify the codec type immediately (like `-c:v copy -c:a copy`) or simply `-c copy` for all streams. This would lead to an invalid command.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example, as both commands contain invalid syntax. However, the specific reason for failure differs in this case. The model's output fails because it incorrectly specifies codec options rather than due to a nonexistent option. Nonetheless, it can be considered a failing output.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page. The `-c` option is not used appropriately, leading to an invalid command. According to the man page, the correct usage to copy streams would be either `-c:v copy -c:a copy` for specific video and audio streams or `-c copy` without specifying codecs if copying all formats.\n\n4) Overall, the model's response contains significant errors in the ffmpeg command that violate the requirements, leading it to fail in producing a viable command for the user's request."
