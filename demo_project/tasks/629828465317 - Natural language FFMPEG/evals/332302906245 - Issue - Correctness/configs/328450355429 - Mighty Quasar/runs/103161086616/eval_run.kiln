  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with noise reduction applied, we'll use the following technique:\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-vn` disables video recording, so only audio is processed.\n- `-af afftdn` applies a simple noise reduction using Fast Fourier Transform Domain Denoise filter. This filter examines an FFT of the audio, sets very quiet coefficients to zero, and the reverses the FFT.\n- `-c:a flac` specifies the FLAC audio codec.\n- `-flac-compression-level 12` adjusts the compression level to the highest. A higher compression level will result in more time-consuming encoding.\n- `-sample_fmt flac24` selects a 24-bit sample format to use. You can adjust according to the input format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af afftdn -c:a flac -flac-compression-level 12 -sample_fmt flac24 output.flac\n```\n\nNote that I assumed you want to maintain the original sample rate of the input file. If you want to change that, you'll need to add a `aresample` filter or `ar` option. Also note that afftdn filter tends to alter an original audio significantly. Some noise may not be reduced.  Alternative denoising solutions, such as RNNoise, exhibit better quality, however may additionally depend on librnnoise installation and filter examples tend to require an already tuned configuration.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance based on the provided output and the specified criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model did generate a command that is likely correct given the user request to extract audio, encode it to FLAC using the \"experimental codec,\" and apply noise reduction. The techniques and parameters mentioned in the explanation seem appropriate for these tasks. The command itself does not exhibit syntax errors or unsupported operations based on the general understanding of ffmpeg usage. Thus, it does **not** contain the described issue.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The generated command does not mirror the failing output example provided. The command generated does not utilize any undefined or incorrect parameters (like `-preset extra_fast`) and follows a logical structure, which indicates it is more aligned with well-formed commands. Therefore, it does **not** resemble the example of a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generally adheres to the specifications provided in the ffmpeg man page. It specifies the input file correctly, applies filters, suppresses video output with `-vn`, and encapsulates the audio in the FLAC format correctly utilizing the supported codec. Additionally, `-af afftdn` is a valid audio filter for noise reduction. There are a couple of issues, however: \n      - `-flac-compression-level` is miswritten: it should be `-compression_level` for FLAC, meaning this part of the command could lead to errors.\n      - `-sample_fmt flac24` also seems incorrect; the sample format should instead be specified with `-sample_fmt s16` or an appropriate option for the output. \n   - Therefore, while the overall command is mostly correct, the specific flags mentioned make the command potentially problematic.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation:**\n- Since I have identified potential issues regarding miswritten flags in the command though it meets the overall user requirements, the model's response could lead to issues being encountered during execution. Thus the output contains an issue due to these inaccuracies despite being a good effort overall. It ultimately leads to a determination of “fail” because the command generated has inaccuracies that could prevent it from executing correctly."
