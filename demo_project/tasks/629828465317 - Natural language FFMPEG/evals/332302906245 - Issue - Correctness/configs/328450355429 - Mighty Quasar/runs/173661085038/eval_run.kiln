  "input": "I need to compress a video to 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming.",
  "output": "To compress a video to a 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding, you should use the `-b:v` option to explicitly specify the video bitrate. This is important for controlling the bitrate, especially during streaming.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies H.264 encoding.\n- `-b:v 500M` sets the video bitrate to 500 Mbps (use \"M\" for megabits per second).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio to AAC at 128 kbps (a common audio bitrate for streaming).\n- Adding `-x264opts keyint=30:min-keyint=30:no-rc:vfr -movflags +faststart` (for MP4) or similar for your container option can help with compatibility and smooth streaming.\n- Using `-preset fast` balances speed and compression efficiency to reduce encoding time.\n\nIf your input container is different (e.g., `.mkv` and your container choice could be different), just change the output extension accordingly and possibly the container-specific options.\n\nExample command for MP4 container:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 500M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -x264opts keyint=30:min-keyint=30:no-rc:vfr -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command ensures proper bitrate control for streaming via H.264 encoding and optimal compatibility by placing metadata in the right position within the MP4 file.\n\nUse this template with the appropriate output file extension and container encoding options as necessary for your case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description> because the generated ffmpeg command effectively meets the user's requirement to set a video bitrate of 500 Mbps using H.264 encoding for streaming.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the <failure_example>. The command generated by the model uses the proper syntax and includes valid parameters. The option `-preset extra_fast` which does not exist is not present; instead, it uses `-preset fast`, which is valid.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are correctly structured, and the order of input/output files follows the required syntax: inputs followed by options before outputs.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue; therefore, it should pass this evaluation. The generated ffmpeg command is correct and appropriately matches the user's request."
