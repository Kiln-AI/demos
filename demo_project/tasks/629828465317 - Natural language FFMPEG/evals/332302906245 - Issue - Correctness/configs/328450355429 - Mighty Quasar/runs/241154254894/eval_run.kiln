  "output": "To convert file.mp4 to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the veryslow preset, you should use the libvpx encoder. The veryslow preset maximizes compression efficiency at the cost of encoding time, which is suitable for archiving, high-quality playback, or situations where file size matters more than encoding speed.\n\nHere’s a command that uses the suggested options:\n\n- -c:v libvpx selects the VP8 video codec.\n- -b:v 0 uses constant quality (Q) mode.\n- -q:v 0-10 quality scale for VP8; lower means better quality (recommend 5–7 depending on your needs, 6 is a good starting point).\n- -cpu-used 0 applies the slowest, best quality preset.\n- -auto-alt-ref 1 enables alternate reference frames for better compression/quality (default, but explicit for transparency).\n- -c:a libvorbis uses the Vorbis audio codec (standard for WebM).\n- -b:a 128k encodes audio at 128kbps (adjust as needed).\n\nAssumption: You want balanced quality and reasonable file size.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 0 -q:v 6 -cpu-used 0 -auto-alt-ref 1 -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k file_slow.webm\n```\n\nAdjust the -q:v value (5 for higher, 7 for lower quality) as necessary for your particular content.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It generates a valid ffmpeg command that accurately converts from MP4 to WebM using the VP8 codec and the specified preset.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command contains valid and applicable options for the specified task, and there are no missing or incorrectly used parameters.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies video and audio codecs, bitrate, and options for VP8 video encoding as well as audio encoding for the output format.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a proper ffmpeg command consistent with the user request, fulfilling the conversion requirements without any incorrect or invalid options. Therefore, the output should be considered as passing this evaluation."
