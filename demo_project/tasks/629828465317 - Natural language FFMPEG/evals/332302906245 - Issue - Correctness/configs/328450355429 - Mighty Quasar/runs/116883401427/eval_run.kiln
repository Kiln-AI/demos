  "output": "You want to convert `input.avi` to an MP4 file with 720p resolution and a constant bitrate (CBR) of 2000 kbps for consistent streaming. This is useful for streaming applications where a predictable bitrate is desired.\n\n- `scale=-2:720` resizes the video to 720p, maintaining the aspect ratio.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 video codec.\n- `-b:v 2000k` sets the video bitrate to 2000 kbps (CBR).\n- `-c:a aac` encodes the audio using the AAC codec.\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n- `output.mp4` specifies the output file name.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The generated command correctly converts the input video to MP4 format with a specified resolution and a constant bitrate as requested by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example provided in <failure_example>. The command generated by the model is valid and does not reference an incorrect option or flag.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The specified options for scaling the video, setting the codec, and establishing a constant bitrate for video and audio are all valid and align with the guidelines provided in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generated a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's specifications. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
