  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from an input file and combine them into one output file, you use `-map` options. Here, `-map 0:10` selects the 10th stream (video) and `-map 0:18` selects the 18th stream (audio) from the input `broadcast.ts`. By default, ffmpeg will copy the codec if you specify `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding.\n\nAssuming you want to keep codecs as is for efficiency and your output container supports these codecs (e.g., MP4 or MKV), here's the command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i broadcast.ts`: input file\n- `-map 0:10`: selects stream 10 from input 0 (the only input)\n- `-map 0:18`: selects stream 18\n- `-c copy`: copies streams without re-encoding\n- `output.mkv`: output filename with MKV container supporting many codecs and multiple streams\n\nIf you know the codecs and want a different container, you can adjust accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The output appears to correctly address the user's request to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of the input file `broadcast.ts`, and then combine these streams. The command uses appropriate `-map` options and `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding, which aligns with the user's requirements. Therefore, the output does **not** contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The model's output command is valid and does not resemble the failing output example, which features an incorrect preset command. The command generated by the model correctly specifies the streams to map and utilize the `-c copy` option. Additionally, there are no invalid options in the command. Hence, the output is **not** similar to the failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model adheres to the specifications in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to select streams and uses `-c copy` to copy codecs without re-encoding. The output format specified (`output.mkv`) is compatible with both video and audio streams, ensuring that it does not violate any requirements found in the man page. Therefore, **the command does not break any requirements** dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the"
