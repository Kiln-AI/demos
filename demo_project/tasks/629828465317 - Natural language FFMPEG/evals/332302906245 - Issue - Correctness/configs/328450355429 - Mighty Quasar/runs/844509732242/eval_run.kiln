  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract high-quality audio from video.mkv and save it as an MP3, use a high-bitrate audio codec such as libmp3lame with a maximum bitrate of 320 kbps, which is widely regarded as the best quality for MP3.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` selects the MP3 encoder.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the output audio bitrate to 320 kbps for maximum audio quality.\n- No video output is specified, so only the audio is extracted.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k audio.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command produced correctly implements the requirement of extracting audio from a video and saving it as an MP3 file with maximum bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated does not have any incorrect or non-existent options like `-preset extra_fast`; all the options used in the command are valid as per the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. There are no violations in the syntax or usage of the options provided. The command correctly specifies the input file (`video.mkv`), utilizes the `libmp3lame` codec for MP3 audio extraction, and sets the bitrate to 320 kbps, which is supported and documented.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a valid and requirement-compliant FFmpeg command. Thus, it would pass the evaluation criteria."
