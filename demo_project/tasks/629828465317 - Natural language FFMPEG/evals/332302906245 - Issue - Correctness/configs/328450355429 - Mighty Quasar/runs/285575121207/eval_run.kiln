  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, we'll use the `vstack` filter in FFmpeg, which stacks input videos vertically (or horizontally with `hstack`).\n\nAssuming both videos have the same width (if not, you may want to add scaling or padding), the command will be straightforward:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-filter_complex vstack` is where the magic happens, vertically stacking the two input videos.\n- Since we're not specifying an input for the filter, FFmpeg will automatically use all input streams (i.e., both videos).\n- `-c:v libx264` selects the H.264 video codec for efficient compression and broad compatibility.\n- `-crf 18` sets a high quality for the output; adjust as needed (lower values result in higher quality, but larger file sizes).\n\nIf the videos have different widths, you may need to add scaling or padding to ensure proper alignment. For example, to scale the wider video to match the narrower one, you could use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=768:-1[v0];[1:v]scale=768:-1[v1];[v0][v1]vstack\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4\n```\n\nHere, `[0:v]` and `[1:v]` refer to the video streams from the first and second input files, respectively. The `scale` filter is used to set the width of both videos to 768 pixels (adjust this value as necessary), and then `vstack` is applied to the scaled streams (`[v0]` and `[v1]`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated is valid for stacking two videos vertically, utilizing the `vstack` filter correctly, and includes proper codec settings. The command should work as required given the provided user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4`) is structured correctly and uses recognized options available in FFmpeg. It does not contain any invalid options or syntactical mistakes.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly uses the `-i` option for input files, `-filter_complex` for applying the vertical stack filter, and specifies codec and quality settings that are valid. The output file name is provided correctly at the end of the command line.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output passes the evaluation since it does not contain the described issue, aligns with the expected format, and adheres to the guidelines set forth in the FFmpeg man page."
