  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from the MKV and encode it as high-quality MP3, copy the extracted bit-stream into LAME’s highest-quality preset (320 kb/s CBR) and stereo channel mode.  \n(VBR “–V0” would actually yield slightly larger files while retaining perceptual transparency, but the prompt says “maximum bitrate”, so we pick 320 k CBR.)\n\n- **-vn** disables all video streams (pure audio output).  \n- **-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k** encodes the audio with LAME at its maximum constant bitrate.  \n- If the original track >2 channels we add **-ac 2** to force stereo; leave it out if you want to preserve multi-channel audio verbatim.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described where the generated ffmpeg command fails to work correctly or does not match the user's requirements. The command provided effectively extracts audio from the specified video file and encodes it as a high-quality MP3 with a maximum bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid, and uses existing parameters and commands relevant to the task at hand, thereby following the proper syntax and guidelines set forth by ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-i` option to specify the input file, `-vn` to disable the video stream, `-c:a libmp3lame` to specify the audio codec, and `-b:a 320k` to set the audio bitrate to the desired maximum of 320 kbps. The output format is properly designated with an appropriate filename.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issues described. The command generated is appropriate, works correctly according to the ffmpeg documentation, and aligns with the user’s request for extracting audio from a video file and saving it as a high-quality MP3 file. Thus, it passes evaluation."
