  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set your video bitrate to 10,000,000 bps (10 Mbps) and your audio bitrate to 1,000,000 bps (1 Mbps) for streaming, use the -b:v and -b:a options respectively in your ffmpeg command. For max streaming compatibility, also encode your video with H.264 and audio with AAC, set pixel format to yuv420p, and enable faststart for web streaming.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file is input.mp4.\n- Youâ€™re targeting browser/device compatibility for streaming.\n\nCommand explanation:\n- -c:v libx264: Use the H.264 encoder for video.\n- -b:v 10000k: Set video bitrate to 10 Mbps.\n- -maxrate 10000k -bufsize 20000k: Limit bitrate and provide a buffer, good for streaming.\n- -c:a aac: Use AAC for audio.\n- -b:a 1000k: Set audio bitrate to 1 Mbps.\n- -movflags +faststart: MP4 metadata is moved to the start for faster streaming initiation.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures pixel format compatibility across browsers and devices.\n- -preset fast: Balances speed and quality; use slow for better compression, faster for faster encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000k -maxrate 10000k -bufsize 20000k -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output_stream.mp4\n```\nThis command will produce a high-bitrate MP4 file optimized for streaming with strong media compatibility. Adjust the preset and values as needed for your specific requirements.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the stated issue. The command generated is well-structured and appropriate for the user's requirements of setting specific video and audio bitrates, as well as optimizing for streaming.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is logically constructed and does not utilize any non-existent flags or presets.\n\n3) Upon review of the man page for FFmpeg, the command does not break any requirements dictated. It correctly applies options to set the video and audio bitrates as per the user's request and uses supported codecs and formats.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it should pass. The command works correctly and matches the user's requirements accurately."
