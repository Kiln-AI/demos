  "input": "I want to encode my video with the flash preset to get the conversion done as quickly as possible.",
  "output": "The \"flash\" preset in ffmpeg refers to an extremely fast encoding preset that prioritizes speed over compression efficiency. It encodes video very quickly but results in larger file sizes and lower compression quality compared to slower presets.\n\nAssuming you're using libx264 for H.264 encoding, you can specify the preset as \"ultrafast\" which corresponds to the fastest encode speed (similar to \"flash\").\n\nHere's a basic command structure, assuming your input is input.mp4 and you want output.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Takes input.mp4 as input file\n- Uses the x264 encoder with the ultrafast preset\n- Encodes audio as AAC at 128kbps\n- Outputs the new file output.mp4\n\nIf you want me to incorporate any other options like resizing, format changes, or bitrate settings, just let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated is valid and should work correctly, aligning with the user's request for fast encoding with the \"flash\" preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example. The preset \"ultrafast\" does exist and corresponds to a valid encoding speed category in ffmpeg. This confirms that the command is valid.\n\n3) Reviewing the command against the ffmpeg man page, it adheres to the general rules regarding command structure, order of options, and use of valid codec and preset names. There are no requirements from the man page that the command breaks.\n\n4) Based on the overall evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described, passes comparison with the failing example, and complies with the requirements in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should be marked as a successful output."
