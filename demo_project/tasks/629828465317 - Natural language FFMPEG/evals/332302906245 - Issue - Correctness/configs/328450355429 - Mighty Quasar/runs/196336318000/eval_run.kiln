  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To apply stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformation in series, we’ll build a single `-vf` (video-filter) chain so the frames flow from one step to the next in memory with no intermediate files.  The recommended order is:\n\n1. **deshake** (or vidstabdetect/ vidstabtransform) – works best on the original motion data  \n2. **color-grading** – operate on the now-steady image so masks stay aligned  \n3. **rotate / scale / crop** – final geometric stage, after color changes\n\nI’m assuming you have already generated the initial transforms file with vidstabdetect in a prior pass (typical workflow).  If needed, drop the `transforms.trf` generation command into an earlier `ffmpeg` call, but here we only showcase the **apply** pass.\n\nParameters that may need tuning  \n- ‑vf \"vidstabtransform …\" trf file injects the studied motion  \n- \"colorchannelmixer …\" example adds a warm, slightly contrasted grade  \n- \"rotate … n*PI/180\" rotates clockwise n degrees  \n- \"scale\" final resizes, here to 1920×1080 while keeping SAR 1:1  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i shaky.mp4 \\\n  -vf \"vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:zoom=5:optzoom=1:interpol=bicubic,\\\n       colorchannelmixer=.393:.769:.189:0:.349:.686:.168:0:.272:.534:.131,\\\n       rotate=4*(PI/180),\\\n       scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=1920:1080\" \\\n  -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -c:a copy stabilized_graded_scaled.mp4\n```\n\n- `vidstabtransform` reads the pre-computed `transforms.trf` (created earlier by `-vf vidstabdetect`)  \n- `colorchannelmixer` is one possible LUT-free grade; swap in `curves` or `lut3d` if you have a .cube file  \n- `rotate` value is in radians; replace `4*(PI/180)` with your desired angle  \n- Final `scale / crop` guarantees a full-window 1920×1080 output; adjust or omit to taste",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is logically constructed and aligns with the user’s request to apply stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations in series. The command appropriately chains the filters in the `-vf` option and does not make conflicting claims or include erroneous syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given in the failure example. The command generated by the model does not contain any clearly incorrect parameter names or missing required elements. It uses valid `ffmpeg` constructs, such as suitable video filters and codecs.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options and filters used (`vidstabtransform`, `colorchannelmixer`, `rotate`, and `scale`) are correctly structured according to `ffmpeg` syntax. The command follows the requirement that options be applied to the specified input or output file.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation steps above, the model's output passes as it does not contain any errors regarding the correctness of the `ffmpeg` command or its adherence to `ffmpeg` requirements. The command functions as intended and meets the user's requirements without issues."
