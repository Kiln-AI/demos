  "output": "To convert input.flv to an MP4 using the x264 codec for video and AAC audio at 320 kbps, the command includes:\n\n- `-c:v libx264` to use the high-quality x264 codec for video encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 320k` to encode audio with AAC at 320 kbps for clear quality.\n- `-crf 23` to balance quality and file size; values below 18 mean higher quality, above 28 mean smaller size.\n- `-preset slow` for better compression efficiency and smaller output size (adjust to faster/smaller if preferred).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` to make the output ready for streaming.\n\nAssuming the output will be called output.mp4 and you want to maintain the original resolution and audio channels.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.flv -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain issues as described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model appears to be correctly structured and fulfills the userâ€™s requirements for converting `input.flv` to MP4 using `libx264` for video and `AAC` at `320kbps` for audio.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated by the model uses valid options and parameters, whereas the failure example uses an invalid preset which does not exist. The model correctly specifies a valid encoding codec and bitrate.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. The options and their usage are aligned with what is outlined in the man page, including correctly specifying the codecs and bitrates. The `-preset` option is valid, and `-pix_fmt yuv420p` is a suitable choice for compatibility.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
