  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple video filters in a single command, you can chain them using the `-filter` keyword. Each filter should be specified separately, often separated by commas or semicolons.\n\nI assume you want to:\n\n1.  **Overlay text**:\n\n    *   `-vf`, short for \"video filter\", is prepended to all filter names. You'll likely use it, but it's good to know that it covers all video filters.\n    *   `fgd`, short for \"framegrabdownfilter\", overlays a single image on the top left corner. Be sure to replace \"image.jpg\" with your video card\n2.  **Apply blur**:\n\n    *   `unsharp`, short for \"unsharp mask\", adds a subtle brightness-contrast adjustment. If only wanted sharpness, use filter `fftune`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"fgd=text 'overlaid_text.txt':x=0:y=0,\nunsharp=2:1:1:2,fftune=2\" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n    Replace `\"text 'overlaid_text.txt':x=0: y=0\"` with the desired text (`file:overlay_on the same line as the \\text`) or more than one line is your desired text to show and replace `(0,0)` within overlay text if you had an entire window for the overlaid image since is done in one command.\n\nPlease note: The actual command can be as long as ever",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the output contains issues. Specifically, the command generated is incorrect because it uses the filter `fgd`, which is not a valid FFmpeg filter for overlaying text. Instead, the correct filter is `drawtext`. The command also incorrectly references `unsharp` for applying a blur effect, which is meant for sharpening, not blurring. The correct filter for blurring would be `boxblur` or `gblur`. Thus, the command is not valid and will not work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output does share similarities with the example of a failing output. It provides a command with incorrect filter names and parameters that won't execute correctly in FFmpeg, paralleling how the `extra_fast` preset does not exist in the failure example.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page because it uses nonexistent filters and syntax. The right filters and syntax for overlaying text and applying a blur effect should follow the guidelines provided in FFmpeg's documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output fails because it contains an issue - the command is invalid due to the incorrect filter names and parameters. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements of the task."
