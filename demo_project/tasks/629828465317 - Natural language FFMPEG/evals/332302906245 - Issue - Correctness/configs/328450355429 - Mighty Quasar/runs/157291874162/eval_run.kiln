  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo extract high-resolution frames every 2 seconds from your video and save them as PNG images, use the `-vf fps=0.5` filter (since 1 frame every 2 seconds equals 0.5 frames per second) and specify the format option `-f image2` to generate numbered image files. PNG preserves full resolution and image quality.\n\nAssuming you want the output files named like `frame%04d.png` (which gives frame0001.png, frame0002.png, etc.), and you want to extract them without any resizing (so you get the full original resolution), here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -f image2 frame%04d.png\n```\n\n- `-i video.avi`: input video.\n- `-vf fps=0.5`: extracts 0.5 frames per second (every 2 seconds).\n- `-f image2`: specifies image output format.\n- `frame%04d.png`: output naming pattern. You can change the format string if different numbering is needed.\n- PNG format is selected by the `.png` extension, which ensures lossless, ultra-high-quality images.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the \"<issue_description>\". It generates a command that is valid and correctly matches the user's request to extract frames from a video every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided \"<failure_example>\". The command produced by the model is effective and adheres to the requirements of the task without including any nonexistent parameters or erroneous syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input and output, utilizes the appropriate options for frame extraction (e.g., `-vf fps=0.5`), and does not contradict any rules stated in the documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, it should pass since it does not contain the issue described, nor does it resemble a failing output or violate any command requirements ultimately predicted by the man page."
