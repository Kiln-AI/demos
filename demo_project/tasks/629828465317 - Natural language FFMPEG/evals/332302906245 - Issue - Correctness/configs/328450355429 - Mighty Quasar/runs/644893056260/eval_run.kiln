  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from video.avi and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution, you can use the fps filter to get one frame every 2 seconds (0.5 fps), and scale the video up to a very high resolution. Assuming \"ultra high resolution\" means something like 4K (3840x2160), you can scale frames accordingly.\n\n- -vf \"fps=0.5,scale=3840:2160\" extracts 1 frame every 2 seconds and scales to 4K.\n- Output files named frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, etc.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=0.5,scale=3840:2160\" frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nIf your input video resolution is lower, upscaling may reduce quality, but this approach gives ultra high output resolution frames. Adjust scale parameters as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly matches the user's requirements to extract frames from a video every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images while maintaining the desired ultra-high resolution.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and adheres to the ffmpeg syntax requirements.\n\n3) The code does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid options such as `-vf` for applying video filters, and the syntax is structured correctly to specify input video, filter options, and output file naming conventions.\n\n4) Based on the considerations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, hence it should pass."
