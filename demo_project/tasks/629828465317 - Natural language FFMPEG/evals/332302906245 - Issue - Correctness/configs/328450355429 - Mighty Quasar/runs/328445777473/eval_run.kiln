  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert the MKV file to MP4, we need to use the libvpx codec, also known as VP8 or VP9, for the video encoding, and the vorbis or opus codec for the audio. However, the opus codec is only supported with the WebM container. Since you want to use an MP4 container, I'll use the VP9 codec for video and aac (Advanced Audio Coding) for audio which is a widely used and supported codec.\n\n- c:v libvpx-vp9 tells FFmpeg to use VP9 for video encoding. VP9 is a royalty-free codec with similar, or even better, performance than H.264.\n- -crf 10 controls the quality, lower values increase the quality and the bitrate.\n- c:a libvorbis isn't suitable here. Let's use aac codec instead.\n-strict experimental isn't needed anymore.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 10 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\nHowever, without more info on your video, you might need to specify some additional parameters (video resolution, frame rate) to adapt the output according to your needs. This would typically be handled with the `scale` or `fps` filters, respectively:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf scale=-2:720 -r 30 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 10 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\nThe -vf scale=-2:720 here specifies a 720 height resolution with an automatically chosen width, and the -r 30 option limits the frame rate to 30 FPS.\n\nKeep in mind these codecs are supported by newer browsers for MP4 WebM (mtx chrome not having decode any mp4 that isn't h264 and h265).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1. **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue_description?**\n   - Yes, the output does contain an issue. The primary problem is that the model recommended using the `libvpx-vp9` codec for converting to MP4, but this codec is not compatible with the MP4 container format as it typically requires `libx264` or `libhevc` for video encoding in MP4 files. Thus, this conversion command will not work as intended. Additionally, using `libvorbis` for audio was mentioned but then corrected to `aac`, which is appropriate for MP4, but the video codec choice remains incorrect.\n\n2. **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - While the model's output is not identical to the provided failure example (which featured an incorrect preset), it does still generate a command that is fundamentally flawed due to the incompatibility of codec and container format, which would lead to a failure in achieving the desired result.\n\n3. **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Yes, the command breaks the requirements dictated in the man page as explained above. Specifically, using `libvpx-vp9` for a format that doesn't support it (MP4) leads to an incompatible output. The output essentially would not produce a valid MP4 file, making it incorrect according to FFmpeg's guidance.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The model's output contains a significant issue by suggesting an improper codec for the told MP4 container. Therefore, it does indeed fail the evaluation."
