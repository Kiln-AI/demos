  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize the shaky video using FFmpeg's `deshake` filter, use the `deshake` filter which applies motion compensation to reduce camera shake. The `deshake` filter has parameters like `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` to define the stabilization rectangle, and `rx`/`ry` for maximum shake in pixels (default 64).\n\nSince no specific parameters were provided, I'll use basic defaults with reasonable settings for handheld shake (max 32px horizontal, 32px vertical shake). The filter will be applied to the entire frame.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=rx=32:ry=32\" -c:a copy stabilized.mp4\n```\n\nNote: I'm copying the audio stream (`-c:a copy`) to avoid re-encoding audio. The output will have the same codec as input but with video stabilized. If you want better quality, consider using `-c:v libx264 -crf 23` instead of the default codec settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly uses the `deshake` filter, with appropriate parameters for stabilization. Therefore, it matches the requirements from the user, and the command should function as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The generated command does not include any non-existent parameters or options; all components (including the `deshake` filter and parameters used) are valid within FFmpeg's capabilities.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options and parameters used (such as `-vf`, `-c:a copy`, etc.) are all appropriate and correctly formatted according to the synopsis of the `ffmpeg` command in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output passes all evaluation checks listed, it does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should be marked as passing."
