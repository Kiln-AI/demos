  "output": "To convert `input.mp4` to MKV using the x265 encoder with the `veryslow` preset while copying the audio stream, use the following command:\n\n- `c:v libx265` specifies the x265 encoder for the video stream.\n- `preset veryslow` uses the `veryslow` preset, providing better compression at the cost of encoding time.\n- `c:a copy` directly copies the audio stream from the input file to the output file without re-encoding.\n- The `.mkv` extension ensures the output is in the Matroska container format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly matches the user's requirements of converting `input.mp4` to MKV using the x265 encoder with the `veryslow` preset and copying the audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is valid and does not use any non-existent parameters or presets.\n\n3) The command follows the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options and parameters is correct, and all specified codecs and options (`libx265`, `veryslow`, and `copy`) are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues described and adheres to the requirements, it can be concluded that the model's output is correct and successful in generating a valid `ffmpeg` command. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
