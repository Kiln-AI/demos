  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert an OGG audio file encoded with the Vorbis codec to a WAV file with a sample rate of 48 kHz, you can use ffmpeg's audio resampling feature (-ar 48000) and specify the input and output formats. ffmpeg will automatically use the appropriate decoder based on the input file format (vorbis in OGG by default).\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -ar 48000 audio.wav\n```\n\nThis command takes \"audio.ogg\" as input, sets the output sample rate to 48,000 Hz, and saves the result as \"audio.wav\" in WAV format.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain an issue. The command it generated is valid and correctly reflects the user's request to convert an OGG file to WAV format using a 48 kHz sample rate.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated is syntactically correct and does not include any non-existent options or incorrect parameters.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Reviewing the command `ffmpeg -i audio.ogg -ar 48000 audio.wav`, it adheres to the requirements laid out in the man page:\n     - It uses `-i` to specify the input file correctly.\n     - The `-ar` option to set the sample rate is appropriately used.\n     - The output file is specified at the end of the command, maintaining the correct order of parameters.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - It should pass as it does not contain any issues. The command is valid, syntactically correct, and fully meets the user's requirements."
