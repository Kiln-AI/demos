  "output": "To select only video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from broadcast.mkv and save them as an MP4 file, use the -map option. This allows you to specify exactly which streams to include in the output, ignoring all others. H.264 video and AAC audio will be used inside the MP4 for maximum compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Video = stream 0:4 (fourth video stream)\n- Audio = stream 0:9 (tenth audio stream)\n- You want to convert them to commonly-supported codecs for MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -c:v libx264 -map 0:9 -c:a aac -b:a 128k trimmed.mp4\n```\n\n- -map 0:4 selects the fourth video stream.\n- -c:v libx264 encodes it in H.264 format.\n- -map 0:9 selects the tenth audio stream.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio in AAC at 128 kbps.\n- output file is named trimmed.mp4.\n\nThis command will copy only the specified streams and transcode them appropriately for the MP4 container.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams, and properly encodes them into a compatible MP4 format.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any erroneous parameters like a non-existent preset. Instead, it uses valid and standard parameters for the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax and utilizes the `-map` option appropriately to select the specified input streams and encode them correctly. The usage of `-c:v libx264` for video encoding and `-c:a aac` for audio encoding is also in line with the recommended practices for MP4 files.\n\n4) The model's output is correct and appropriate based on the user input, as it meets the specified requirements of selecting the correct streams and saving them in the desired output format. Therefore, it should pass."
