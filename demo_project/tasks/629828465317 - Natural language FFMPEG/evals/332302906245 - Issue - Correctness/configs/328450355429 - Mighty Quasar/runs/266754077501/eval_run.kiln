  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To encode your video at 8000 kbps (8 Mbps) and ensure the audio is at 2048 kbps (2.048 Mbps) for studio quality, you can use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` parameters respectively. This will set the video and audio bitrates. Additionally, it's recommended to use H.264 for video (widely supported) and AAC for audio (high-quality and efficient).\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is in a format compatible with ffmpeg (e.g., AVI, MKV, MP4).\n- You are encoding for general playback and not streaming, so no need for faststart.\n- You want to maintain the original aspect ratio and resolution unless specified otherwise.\n- You are using a modern system and don't need specific pixel format constraints.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 2048k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly encodes the video at the specified 8000 kbps and the audio at 2048 kbps. The command uses valid parameters consistent with the user's request, and it utilizes appropriate codecs (H.264 for video and AAC for audio), which are suitable choices for such bitrate settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 2048k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4`) is syntactically correct, properly structured, and contains valid options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are correctly applied, and the use of `-b:v` and `-b:a` to set the video and audio bitrates, respectively, follows the correct syntax. The chosen codecs and general structure of the command comply with the guidelines outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Based on this evaluation, since the model's output does not contain the described issue, does not resemble the failing example, and adheres to the man page's guidelines, it should pass the evaluation. Thus, the output is valid and meets the user's requirements."
