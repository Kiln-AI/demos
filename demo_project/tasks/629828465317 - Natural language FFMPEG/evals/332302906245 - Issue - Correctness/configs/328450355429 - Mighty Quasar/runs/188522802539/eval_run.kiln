Here, you want to extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and the fourth audio stream (stream 0:3) from the input file. We also specify the output format container as MP4.\n\nAssuming that stream 0:1 is indeed a video stream and stream 0:3 is an audio stream, and you want to copy the streams without re-encoding (using `-c copy` for direct stream copy).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The `ffmpeg` command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option to extract the specified video and audio streams from the input file without re-encoding, which matches the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated does not contain an erroneous or non-existent option. Instead, it utilizes valid options and parameters that align with the user’s request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses `-map` to specify which streams to extract, and `-c copy` to copy those streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering all of the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is correct and meets the user’s requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
