  "input": "Transform input.mp4 to MKV using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copy the video stream",
  "output": "To transform `input.mp4` to MKV with the x265 encoder and the veryslow preset, and copy the video stream:\n\n`x265` is used for encoding video, available transcoding to both H.265/HEVC and H.264/AVC. However, since `x265` is not default (it's in `ffmpeg` 3.10 and later in Git, and likely in your system for distribution to a newer user or a specific, modern system), in the past, you would use hand-developed tools (`x265-distribute`, `x264` if you want real-time transcoding or needed raw video data).\n\nFirst, ensure that `x265` and `ffmpeg` are installed. If `x265` is available, remove it to start fresh (the usual process depending on the environment of the system).\n\n`ffmpeg` has a filter for using `x265` or `libx265` that does this successfully but only if `ffmpeg` has a compatible `ffmpeg` version (`version >= 4.2`):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -map_metadata 1 -map_chapters -1 -c:v libx265 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a copy input.mp4 output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-map_metadata 1` maps all metadata to the output file.\n- `-map_chapters -1` disables this feature (not applicable in this case because the input does not have chapters), this value has to be set otherwise. The -1 tells the input file all chapters to be mapped to the output\n- `-c:v libx265` specifies that video is encoded using the x265 encoder.\n- `-crf 23` sets the quality level for video encoding (lower is better). The value is between 1 and 51; the lower the value, the better the video quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` sets the output pixel format to the one used in the input file, specifically yuv420p which is suitable for all common platforms (including those for web-browsers).\n- `-movflags +faststart` enables fragmented MP4 for optimal streaming (previously introduced in version 4.3, so apply if all your systems need to stream fast).\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio stream from the source (in this case, a single track), this value, combined with no other parameters, yields optimal results, with best compatibility with browsers for 2000+ users.\n\nPlease, note that the veryslow preset is not a standard preset used by `ffmpeg` and x265 (from development) for encoding video, where `ffmpeg` or x265 are running. That preset is not going to be valid in a current (3.10 or later)  `ffmpeg` command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The generated command does not match the user request, particularly because the user specifically asked for the `x265 encoder with the veryslow preset` but the output command uses `libx265` without specifying the `veryslow` preset.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example given in that it generates a command that may not work correctly since the preset `veryslow` is not applied. While the command structure is valid, it doesn't satisfy the full requirements stated in the user input, which is a key aspect of evaluating the command's correctness.\n\n3) The command slightly breaks requirements mandated by the FFmpeg man page, namely by not accurately incorporating the user-requested preset. The model's use of `libx265` is correct for x265 encoding, but it should include the specific `-preset veryslow` option to meet the user's requirement fully.\n\n4) The model's output fails the overall evaluation because it does not produce an ffmpeg command that fulfills the user request for the specific preset, leading to the conclusion that the command generated may not execute as intended."
