  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "To set a video bitrate of 100 Gbps in high quality, you'll want to use a much lower pixel format rate factor to minimize quality loss. The pixel format rate factor controls the number of colors reused in the pixel plane, affecting quality and file size ( Higher factor = larger data, lower quality; lower factor = smaller data, higher quality).\n\nFor audio, setting a bitrate of 500 kbps ensures good audio quality.\n\n- Use -pix_fmt yuv444p or yuv422p for better color coding, impacting quality (yuv422 is widespread, yuv444 provides even better color fidelity but is less common — use this for highest quality).\n- Set -pix_fmt yuv444p for highest quality for video, or yuv420p for wider compatibility (if quality is acceptable).\n- Use -movflags +faststart if you plan to stream the output; otherwise, it's not necessary.\n- Output the file with appropriate container extension, e.g., .mov or .mp4, depending on your inputs.\n\nHere’s an example command assuming you want to output to .mov for high quality video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v hevc -pix_fmt yuv444p -maxrate 1000000k -muxrate 1000000k -bufsize 1836000k -c:a aac -b:a 500k -movflags +faststart output.mov\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v hevc uses H.265 for lossless or near-lossless encoding (or can be used for much smaller streams without compression artifacts).\n- -pix_fmt yuv444p enables the highest color precision for video.\n- -maxrate, -muxrate, -bufsize are rate control parameters to ensure constant quality (useless with hevc, but can be used with other codecs).\n- This command sets video bitrate to significantly less than 100 Mbps, but for true \"100 Gbps,\" you need much lower quality.\n- Audio is AAC at 500 kbps for good quality.\n- -movflags +faststart allows for progressive streaming.\n\nFor higher quality (lower bitrate), videos are typically around 50 Mbps or less. For example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v hevc -pix_fmt yuv444p -maxrate 5000k -muxrate 5000k -bufsize 9000k -c:a aac -b:a 500k output.mov\n```\n\nIf you need lower bitrate for 100 Gbps and willing to use higher quality, use -pix_fmt yuv422p (which is a good tradeoff for big bitrate with minimal quality impact), for example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v hevc -pix_fmt yuv422p -maxrate 1250000k -muxrate 1250000k -bufsize 2295000k -c:a aac -b:a 500k output.mov\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is input.mp4; adjust input filename as needed.\n- 100 Gbps corresponds approximately to 1250 Mbps (1000000000 bit / 8 bit = 125 Mbps per channel in video, so around 3 channels * 1250 Mbps = 3750 Mbps = 3.75 Gbps = 4.76 Gbps for stereo; for true 100 Gbps, input format would have to be re-encoded as RAW video or with uncompressed bitstream).\n\nFor very large bitrate video, typically you'd use uncompressed bitstream output (e.g., raw video container), but that's for much deeper (revised) transcoding often needing to use raw video with ffmpeg. For high-quality output around 100 Gbps, the best tradeoff is to use a high bitrate (say 500 Mbps) with high compatibility pixel format and a high input format pixel format for maximum quality, even if bitrate is not exactly 100 Gbps.\n\n---\n\nSummary: \n- Set video bitrate with -c:v hevc or raw video encoding for high quality and low bitrate.\n- For browser compatibility, use AAC audio at good quality.\n- -pix_fmt yuv444p or yuv422p control color format/quality.\n- For MP4, the above commands work; for MOV, be aware of player support.\n\n---\n\nIf you have a raw or uncompressed video source, it's easier to output to raw video container like .mov4vraw_eyer (or .mov4vraw_1010):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v RawVideo -pix_FMT yuva420p -format 1010 -f mov4vraw -encoding parameters bits_per_sample_x 12 input.mov4vraw_1010.mov\n```\n\nPlease specify the exact input format/pixel format you desire, noting older players or encoders limits.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues in the generated ffmpeg command. The video bitrate specified as '100 Gbps' is excessively high for typical video encoding, and the command initializes the -maxrate parameter with a value of '1000000k', which does not correspond to the intended '100 Gbps' setting, indicating a mismatch between the user's request and what the command does.\n\n2) The model's output has similarities to a failing output example; while it does not include an invalid preset option, it generates a command that does not meet the user's specifications properly. The bitrate settings in the command (e.g., `-maxrate 1000000k`) suggest an extreme miscalculation about what can be feasibly supported in video encoding.\n\n3) The command breaks specific requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. For instance, setting an effective bitrate of '100 Gbps' is impractical and not supported by the ffmpeg guidelines. Additionally, with a video codec using H.265 (indicated by `-c:v hevc`), there are specific bitrate management parameters (-maxrate, -bufsize) that need to be calibrated to match expected output qualities, which this command fails to optimize for. \n\n4) Given the above evaluation:\n- The command fails to meet the user's requirements as intended, which is a clear problem in the model's output. \n- Therefore, based on the presence of issues, I conclude that the model's output contains the problem described, resulting in a failing assessment."
