  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the VP9 codec with 2-pass encoding, you use the libvod (VP9) codec and specify both pass 1 and pass 2 input streams to the encoder for better quality output. \n\n- `-c:v libvod` selects the VP9 codec.\n- The bitrate needs to be specified in two passes to get optimal quality and efficiency. \n- You must specify `-b:v` twice (once for pass 1, generating bitstream info, and again for pass 2 for final output).\n- Input format specified as AVI container (which supports VP9) because standalone players rarely support VP9 in WebM format.\n- Audio codec should be copy-friendly codec if the source audio codec is compatible (usually PCM or Opus) or you can re-encode it to Opus.\n- This is best suited for high-quality, progressive transmission or encoding scenarios. If exact bitrate isn't needed, you can force exact bitrate in pass 1 for quality consistency.\n\nHere are commands for 2-pass VP9 encoding in AVI container:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvod -pass 1 /dev/null -an -f webm -y output_webm_1pas.html\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvod -pass 2 -preset slow -b:v 2500k output_webm_2pas.webm\n```\n\nIf you need AVI container instead, the command will be:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvod -pass 1 /dev/null -an -f avi output_1pas.avi\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvod -pass 2 -preset slow -b:v 2500k output_2pas.avi\n```\n\nThis approach ensures high-quality compression on 2 successive passes, suitable for advanced users wanting optimal encode performance and best visual quality. \n\nAssumption: Input audio is compatible with copying or re-encoding to Opus; if not, add `-c:a copy` or `-c:a libopus -b:a 128k` after first command. Adjust the `-b:v` value as needed for your quality/compression ratio.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue?**\nThe model's output contains an issue. Specifically, it incorrectly mentions \"libvod\" as the VP9 codec, which is a typographical error. The correct codec should be \"libvpx-vp9\". This mistake undermines the accuracy of the command provided.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nWhile the model's output does not contain a command or option that is guaranteed to fail outright (like the `extra_fast` preset), it does generate commands that wouldn't work correctly due to the incorrect codec name. Thus, the output aligns with the concept of failing due to an incorrect command; it may not execute successfully.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe commands, as structured, theoretically should comply with ffmpeg requirements regarding two-pass encoding. However, due to the incorrect codec name and the use of an audio output that doesnâ€™t specify a codec, the command violates best practices outlined in the man page, particularly regarding the need to specify a compatible codec in the audio stream and using the correct codec name.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains issues that could prevent the ffmpeg command from functioning correctly, particularly with the incorrect use of codec names and the lack of appropriate audio options. Hence, the model's output fails to meet the task's requirements."
