  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert `movie.mkv` to MP4 with quick encoding using the ultrafast2 preset, you should specify a widely supported video codec like H.264, set the preset for encoding speed, and copy the existing audio stream to avoid re-encoding if possible. This ensures fast processing and broad compatibility.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies encoding video using H.264.\n- `-preset ultrafast2` sets the encoding preset for speed. (Note: `ultrafast2` is unusual; standard presets are `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, etc. Verify in your ffmpeg version if `ultrafast2` is supported or if you meant `ultrafast`.)\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream directly without re-encoding for speed.\n- The output filename is `movie.mp4`.\n\n*Assuming you want to keep the existing audio codec and only recode video for speed.*\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast2 -c:a copy movie.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue related to the non-standard preset `ultrafast2`, which may not be recognized by all versions of FFmpeg. The explanation notes that `ultrafast2` is \"unusual\" and suggests verifying its support, indicating a potential error in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example, as it mentions a preset (`ultrafast2`) that does not conform to the standard preset names recognized by FFmpeg. Standard presets are `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, `faster`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, and `veryslow`. The command generated would likely fail if the user or environment does not support the `ultrafast2` variant.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements in the FFmpeg man page; however, the use of `ultrafast2` is likely to result in an error if it is not supported. While the command structure itself follows the guidelines from the man page, the choice of preset is critical for the commandâ€™s success.\n\n4) The model's output contains the issue described, as it uses an invalid preset (`ultrafast2`). Therefore, it should fail based on the requirement for the command to work correctly and meet the user's request."
