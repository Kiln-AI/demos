  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add your own subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks from a video, you can instruct ffmpeg to ignore (not map) any existing subtitle streams, and explicitly add your new subtitles via the -vf subtitles filter (for burned-in subtitles) or by including a single subtitle stream (for soft subs). \n\nAssumptions:\n- Your video file is input.mp4 and your new subtitle file is subs.srt.\n- You want to hardcode (burn in) the subtitles for maximum compatibility.\n\nThis command omits all existing subtitle streams by mapping only video, audio, and data, and burns in your new subtitles:\n\n- -map 0:v -map 0:a? selects only video and audio streams, skipping any existing subtitles.\n- -vf subtitles=subs.srt burns in the subtitles.\n- If you want soft subs instead (multiplexed, selectable subs), replace the filter with -map subs.srt and use -c:s mov_text (for MP4).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a? -vf subtitles=subs.srt -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to add soft subtitles rather than burning them in:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a? -map subs.srt -c copy -c:s mov_text -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- The first command removes all original subs and hardcodes your new ones.\n- The second command removes all original subs and adds your new subs as a soft (selectable) subtitle track.\nChoose the approach that fits your use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains an issue. While the command syntax appears to be largely correct, it lacks explicit mention of the input file for the subtitle stream in the first command. This is crucial because failing to specify the input for the new subtitle results in an invalid command. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the provided example in that it does not generate a command with a non-existent option. The issue lies instead with the absent specification of the input for the subtitles.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, by omitting the specification of the subtitles input file for the command `-map subs.srt`, this breaks the requirement in the man page that specifies that options are applied to the next specified file. The command provided for adding subtitles does not correctly identify `subs.srt` as an input stream.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains the issue described, as it does not fully comply with the requirements and details necessary to generate a valid `ffmpeg` command for the userâ€™s request. Thus, the command would likely fail when executed in its current form."
