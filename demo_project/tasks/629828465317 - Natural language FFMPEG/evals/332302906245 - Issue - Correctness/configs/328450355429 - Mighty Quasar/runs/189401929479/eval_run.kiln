  "output": "To convert input.mkv to AVI format using the libx265 (HEVC) codec with the placebo preset, you’ll use the following settings:\n\n- -c:v libx265 encodes the video with the HEVC/H.265 codec.\n- -tag:v hvc1 ensures proper AVI codec tag for HEVC video in AVI output (though HEVC in AVI has limited compatibility; for broader support, consider MP4 or MKV).\n- -preset placebo uses the slowest and highest compression setting (placebo is even slower/better than slower).\n- -crf 28 is a suitable default CRF for H.265/HEVC. You may reduce (e.g., 24–26) for higher quality at the cost of larger file size.\n- -c:a libmp3lame encodes audio to MP3 (since AVI does not support AAC).\n- -b:a 128k encodes audio at 128 kbps.\n\n**Assumption:** The goal is for maximum compression and as high quality as possible given that constraint. This increases encoding time significantly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -tag:v hvc1 -preset placebo -crf 28 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k output.avi\n```\n\n**Important Note:** Using H.265/HEVC in AVI containers is non-standard and may not be playable in all players. For best compatibility with HEVC, use MKV or MP4. If AVI output is required, test your target players.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   The model's command seems to be correctly formed for the specified task of converting an MKV file to AVI format using the libx265 codec. The options used align with the requirements set forth in the user message, and the command syntactically appears valid. Therefore, the command does not contain any apparent issues. **Result: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The comparison to the provided failure example indicates that the model's output does not contain the same type of mistakes. The example showcases an invalid preset (`extra_fast`), which does not exist, while the model's output correctly uses a valid preset (`placebo`). **Result: Pass**\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command seems to adhere to the requirements laid out in the FFmpeg man page. The options are properly ordered and specified, and there are no indications of unsupported formats or codecs. One potential issue noted in the output regarding using HEVC in AVI is correct, as HEVC is not widely supported in AVI formats, but it has been acknowledged by the model with a warning, which doesn't invalidate the command itself. Thus, it does follow the man page's requirements. **Result: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The evaluation shows that the model's output does not contain issues that match the described problem. The output provided is accurate, valid, and includes necessary warnings regarding format compatibility for the chosen codec in the AVI container format.\n   \nFinal verdict: **The model's output passes all evaluation criteria and does not contain issues as defined.**"
