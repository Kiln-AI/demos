  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate 90° clockwise and apply aggressive noise reduction, I'll combine:\n\n- transpose=1 → 90° clockwise rotation (0=90° counter-clockwise, 1=90° clockwise, 2=90° counter-clockwise + vertical flip, 3=90° clockwise + vertical flip)\n- hqdn3d with high values → traditional spatial/temporal denoiser\n- nlmeans with strong settings → modern non-local means denoiser (superior to hqdn3d but heavier)\n- -tune film → libx264 tune for real-life footage (when using the encoder)\n\n`nlmeans` will be chained after `hqdn3d` for maximum effect. Generally start with moderate values and only increase if needed—the settings below are intentionally aggressive (may soften picture too much on some sources).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=8:8:6:6,nnlmeans=9:9:9:21:3\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -tune film -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is H.264 or another lossy codec; re-encoding needed after filtering (audio copied passthrough).\n- Generic container/extension used (.mp4/.mkv); change extensions if needed.  \nDrop `-tune film` for 2D/animated content.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any command issues according to the user's requirements. It correctly includes a command for rotating the video 90 degrees clockwise and applies advanced noise reduction filters using `hqdn3d` and `nlmeans`. Both filters are valid and well-configured. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided since all the parameters and filters used in the command seem to be valid and achievable within the constraints of the command line format. There are no made-up options or erroneous preset values like `extra_fast`.\n\n3) Evaluating against the ffmpeg man page shows no violations. The options specified in the command match the expected use cases and are appropriately applied to the input and output files as per the synopsis. The presence of noise reduction filters is consistent with the functionality offered by ffmpeg.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, it adheres to the requirements of the user message, is coherent with the man page for ffmpeg, and does not include any commands or options that are invalid or nonexistent. Therefore, it can be deemed a correct and high-quality output."
