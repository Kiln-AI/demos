  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg.\n\n- With -map 0:v:1, ffmpeg selects the second video stream (streams are numbered from 0, so v:1 is the second).\n- -map 0:a:3 picks the fourth audio stream (a:3).\n- By mentioning only these streams in -map, any other streams are ignored in the output.\n- This command outputs to output.avi, using the same codecs as the input (you can specify codecs if needed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.avi\n```\n\nAssumptions:  \n- complex.avi contains at least two video streams and four audio streams.\n- You don't need to transcode. If you want to, for example, convert to H.264/AAC:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -map 0:a:3 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.avi\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command matches the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from the input file and uses the correct syntax with the `-map` option. The explanation provided is clear and accurately describes the command's function, ensuring it aligns with the user requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The failing output example contained incorrect parameters that do not exist in the ffmpeg tool (`-preset extra_fast`). In contrast, the model provided a command that correctly makes use of existing ffmpeg parameters and mappings.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command structure follows the proper ordering and syntax conventions laid out in the man page. The `-map` options are appropriately structured, and the `-c copy` option for copying codecs is valid. Additionally, the model specifies the necessary input and output formats correctly.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation steps. It correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's request without errors or unsupported options. Thus, the output should be considered as passing the evaluation."
