  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically with `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, use the `vstack` filter. This filter requires that both videos have the same width (height can differ). If the widths are different, you should first scale/pad them to match.\n\nAssuming both videos have the same width, here’s the simplest command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart stacked.mp4\n```\n\n- `-filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\"` stacks the two video streams vertically.\n- `-map \"[v]\"` selects the stacked video for output.\n- Audio is not included; to add audio, decide which input’s audio you want, e.g., add `-map 0:a?`.\n- Encoding options (`-c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast ...`) produce a compatible MP4.\n\nIf the widths differ, you can add scale filters to match them:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=iw*min(1\\,min(1\\,1)),setsar=1[top]; [1:v]scale=iw*min(1\\,min(1\\,1)),setsar=1[bot]; [top][bot]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart stacked.mp4\n```\n\nBut typically, both sources for stacking should be prepared to have the same width for best results.\n\nLet me know if you need to include audio or handle differing widths!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command correctly stacks the two videos vertically and includes options that are valid based on the specifications provided by the user. It effectively addresses potential concerns regarding video width matching and provides a fallback command if the widths differ. Therefore, the output appears to fulfill the requirements set by the user without errors that would cause the command to fail.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command does not utilize any invalid or non-existent options. All specified options and parameters in the command are legitimate and documented in the FFmpeg manual, making the output a well-formed and functional command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used (`-filter_complex`, `-map`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, etc.) are all valid and conform with the described functionality in the man page. The model also correctly notes that audio is not included, which is consistent with the task of stacking videos and is an appropriate assumption based on the user's request.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and can successfully execute the desired transformation of stacking two videos vertically, therefore it should pass the evaluation."
