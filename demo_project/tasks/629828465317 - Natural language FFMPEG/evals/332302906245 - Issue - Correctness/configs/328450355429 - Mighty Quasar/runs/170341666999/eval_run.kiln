  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To quickly compress your large movie.mkv file, you can use the libx264 encoder with the \"turbo\" preset, which prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency. This will reduce file size faster but may result in a larger file compared to slower presets. We'll also use AAC audio to keep it compatible.\n\nHere's a command that compresses the video with the turbo preset, uses a reasonable CRF value for quality (you can adjust CRF for smaller or higher quality outputâ€”lower CRF means higher quality), and outputs to a new compressed file named movie_compressed.mkv.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k movie_compressed.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to keep the MKV container.\n- AAC audio encoding is sufficient.\n- CRF 28 is a good balance for fast size reduction with acceptable quality. You can adjust as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command produced is syntactically correct and utilizes appropriate options based on the user's request to compress the file using the turbo preset.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command contains valid options and parameters that exist in the `ffmpeg` tool. The \"turbo\" preset is used correctly, so it does not exhibit a similar failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The `-c:v libx264`, `-preset turbo`, `-crf 28`, `-c:a aac`, and `-b:a 128k` options are all valid and correctly applied for video encoding with the specified audio format. The order of the parameters is also followed properly in accordance with `ffmpeg` command syntax.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output is correct, meets the user's request for compressing the movie file quickly using the turbo preset, and does not violate any `ffmpeg` syntax rules. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
