  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To reduce the file size of `video.mp4`, the best approach is to re-encode and optimize the video settings for smaller size. Using a higher quality setting (like CRF), reducing the resolution or video bitrate may be used. Since you want to email, ensure the codec and container support web browsers — H.264/AAC within MP4 is common.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want a reasonable quality for viewing but need reduced file size.\n- Web compatibility is important.\n- The video has a standard resolution or you want to retain the original (just shrink size).\n\nRecommended technique: Use a relatively high quality setting (CRF), reduce the file size with decent quality via `-b:v` (bitrate) and `-movflags +faststart` for progressive download.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 500k -crf 20 -preset veryslow -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output_smaller.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264` — encode video with H.264.\n- `-b:v 500k` — set video bitrate to 500 kbps, adjustable for quality/compression.\n- `-crf 20` provides a good size/quality tradeoff; lower CRF means higher quality (default 18-23 is reasonable).\n- `-preset veryslow` slows down encoding for better compression (use fast for faster).\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows players to start streaming before full download.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` re-encodes audio at 128 kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility on most players.\n\nAdjust `-crf` for bigger/lower quality or bitrate for smaller/larger files as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is syntactically correct and includes appropriate parameters to achieve the task of reducing the file size of `video.mp4`. Each parameter used is valid according to the ffmpeg man page.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 500k -crf 20 -preset veryslow -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output_smaller.mp4`) is well-structured and uses valid options.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options and parameters used are valid, and they follow the guidelines stated in the man page regarding their usage and order.\n\nOverall, the model has generated an appropriate and valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's request while explaining the assumptions and parameters used. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
