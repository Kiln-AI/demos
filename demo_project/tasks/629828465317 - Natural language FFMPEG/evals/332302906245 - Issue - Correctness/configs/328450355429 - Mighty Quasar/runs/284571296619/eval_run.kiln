  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 8000 kbps and the audio bitrate to 512 kbps, you use the `-b:v` option for video bitrate and `-b:a` option for audio bitrate in ffmpeg.\n\nAssuming your input file is `input.mp4` and you want to save the output as `output.mp4`:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 512k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-b:v 8000k`: sets video bitrate to 8000 kbps.\n- `-b:a 512k`: sets audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n- `-c:v libx264`: uses H.264 codec for video encoding.\n- `-c:a aac`: uses AAC codec for audio encoding.\n\nIf you want a different codec or container, you can adjust accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is well-structured, adheres to the user's requirements about setting specific bitrates for both video and audio, and does not contain any obvious mistakes that would prevent it from functioning correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any undefined options or errors; the use of `-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` is correct according to the FFmpeg syntax, ensuring it should operate as intended.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The parameters and flags used (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v libx264`, `-c:a aac`) are all valid, and the command is structured properly, placing options in the correct order relative to input and output files.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain any issues and properly matches the user's request. The command generated is sound, and thus the evaluation passes."
