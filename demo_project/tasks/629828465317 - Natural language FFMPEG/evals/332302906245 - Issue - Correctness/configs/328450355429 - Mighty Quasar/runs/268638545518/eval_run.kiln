  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert your MXF file (`raw_footage.mxf`) into an MP4 with a target video bitrate of exactly 5000 kbit/s using VBR (Variable Bitrate), you should set the `-maxrate` and `-minrate` to the target value, with the `-bufsize` (buffer size) typically set to 2–4x the bitrate to allow for variable burstiness. This will enforce VBR with your specified bitrate.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264.\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the average (target) bitrate to 5 Mbps.\n- `-maxrate 5000k` and `-minrate 5000k` enforce a constant maximum and minimum (so fixed bitrate VBR).\n- `-bufsize` should be larger than the bitrate—here, 10 megabit.\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows the MP4 to be streamable.\n\nHere’s the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -minrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want the output to be compatible with most devices and players (`-c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p`).\n- 5000k/s is your desired video quality (lower will reduce file size, higher will improve quality). Adjust as needed. \n- For fixed bitrate VBR, `-minrate` and `-maxrate` should both match `-b:v`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described; the command it generated is appropriate for the user's request regarding converting a .mxf file to MP4 with a specific bitrate setting. The command uses valid FFmpeg parameters and adheres to the request.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the provided example of a failing output. The command presented by the model is valid and makes use of existing FFmpeg options and parameters correctly, meaning it will execute without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The syntax is correct, and all options used are valid with appropriate explanations provided. The ordering of options adheres to the requirement that options apply to the next specified file.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output passes as it does not contain any issues, properly addresses the user's request, and adheres to the man page requirements."
