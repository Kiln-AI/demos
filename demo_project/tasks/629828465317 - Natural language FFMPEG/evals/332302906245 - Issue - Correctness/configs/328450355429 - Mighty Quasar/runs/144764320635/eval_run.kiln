  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nYou cannot directly create a single output file with dual codecs (H.264 and H.265) encoded from the same source video because MP4 containers only support one video codec stream. However, you can create a single output file that includes one video stream (e.g., H.265) and a copy of the original H.264 stream in a different container or by using multiple passes, but that is not standard practice and is not widely supported.\n\nIf you want to experiment with containing both in a single file, one workaround is to use a Matroska (.mkv) container, which supports multiple video streams. ffmpeg can encode to H.265, and then you can concatenate a copy of an H.264 stream with the same input. However, you must encode each codec separately.\n\nDue to the complexity and common practices, it is more common to create two separate output files. If you indeed insist on something like a single file for both, you can create an MKV with one copy in each codec like this:\n\n1. Create H.265:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a copy h265_output.mkv\n```\n\n2. Create H.265 and link H.264 explicitly (noting an H.264 exists in original):\n```bash\nffmpeg -i h265_output.mkv -c copy -i input.mp4 -map 0 -map 1:v:0 -c copy -c:v:1 libx264 -crf 23 -c:a:0 copy -c:a:1 copy -acodec:a:1 copy -acodec:a:0 copy combined_codec.mkv\n```\n\nGenerally, outputting each codec to a separate file is the standard and most practical method if you need H.264 and H.265 versions.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**  \nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The output incorrectly stated that you can create a single file with dual codecs (H.264 and H.265) simultaneously. It also does not provide a viable FFmpeg command that meets the user's request, since it's explained that only one codec can be used in standard containers like MP4, and while it mentions MKV as an alternative, it doesn't provide a practicable command to achieve that setup satisfactorily. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nIn terms of clarity and correctness, yes, the model's output is similar to the failing output example. It includes an explanation that does not correctly align with FFmpeg's capabilities related to multiple codecs in a standard output file and lacks a directly applicable command for the user's request.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe response does not provide a singular command that adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page for creating an output file with dual codecs. The commands suggested are incorrect in context, as neither outputs a valid use of FFmpeg to convert the video to both codecs within a single output file. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output indeed contains the issue described in the issue description. It fails to provide a correct and functional FFmpeg command that fulfills the user's requirement, thus resulting in a failed evaluation."
