  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a complex media file like `input.mov`, you can use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include in the output.\n\nHere, you want the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream. Note that stream indices are 0-based, meaning the first stream is 0, the second is 1, and so on. Therefore, the 7th video stream is actually stream `v:6` and the 14th audio stream is `a:13`.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream from the first input file (`0:`, which is `input.mov` in this case).\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream from the first input file.\n- `-c copy` is used for stream copying, which means the selected streams are not re-encoded. This is faster but assumes the output format can support the codec of the input streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nAssumption made: Since the output container format is not specified, I chose `.mkv` as it can hold a wide variety of codecs without needing re-encoding, but any format that supports the chosen codecs could be used instead.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generates appears to correctly map the specified 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the input media file and constructs a proper FFmpeg command that aligns with user requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command it generated is valid and appropriate for the task, whereas the failing example contains an invalid preset option (`-preset extra_fast`) that does not exist.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It uses the correct mapping options and assumes that stream copying is allowed. All syntax aligns with the documentation provided.\n\n4) Since the model's output contains no errors, follows the FFmpeg syntax rules correctly, and meets user requirements, it should pass the evaluation."
