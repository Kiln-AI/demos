  "input": "I need to convert my video to MP4 with a bitrate of 50000k for high quality output.",
  "output": "To encode your video to MP4 with a constant video bitrate of 50,000 kbps (which is very high quality), you'll want to use the `-b:v 50000k` option. The command below uses H.264 video (libx264) and AAC audio for broad compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file name is `input.ext` (replace `ext` with your actual extension).\n- You want good quality audio (set to 192k, adjust as needed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-b:v 50000k` sets the video bitrate to 50Mbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` maximizes compatibility.\n- Adjust the audio bitrate or other settings as necessary for your needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's command output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The provided command is correctly formatted, and it meets the user's requirements by specifying a video bitrate of 50,000 kbps and using appropriate codecs that would likely work for an MP4 format.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command shared by the model has valid parameters and structure, whereas the example of a failing output has an incorrect preset option (`-preset extra_fast`) that does not exist.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command adheres to the specifications in the man page. The model correctly uses `-i` to specify the input file, and then follows with the proper options for encoding (video codec, bitrate, audio codec, and pixel format) before the output file. The output format and codec specifications align with what is allowed by FFmpeg.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, as it produces a valid and appropriate FFmpeg command that meets the user's request for a high-quality MP4 conversion. Hence, it should pass the evaluation."
