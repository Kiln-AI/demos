  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames at every 2 seconds from `video.avi` while maintaining the original resolution and quality (as PNG is lossless), use the `fps` filter to set an output frame rate of 0.5 frames per second. The `-f image2` flag ensures the output is saved as a sequence of PNG images.\n\n- `fps=0.5`: Selects 1 frame every 2 seconds (0.5 frames per second).\n- `c:v png`: Encodes frames as PNG (lossless, ultra high resolution assumed).\n- `output-%04d.png`: Generates numbered output files like `output-0001.png`, `output-0002.png`, etc. (4-digit zero-padding).\n- **Assumption**: The input video's original resolution is preserved (no scaling needed). Adjust the output pattern (`frame-%05d.png`, etc.) if you want a different naming format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -c:v png -f image2 output-%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain issues in the command it generated. The parameters used align with the user's request to extract frames every 2 seconds from `video.avi` as PNG images with ultra high resolution, and the command is structured correctly.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not contain an invalid option or a non-existent preset.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any mentioned requirements. The options used are properly applied to the specified output file. The command adheres to the structure and parameters outlined for frame extraction and PNG output.\n\n4) Given these evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation."
