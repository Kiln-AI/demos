  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command appears to be correctly formatted and matches the user requirements of resizing the video to 1080p using the bicubic_sharp filter and encoding with the ultra_fast preset.\n\n2) The modelâ€™s output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is accurate and uses valid ffmpeg options. The preset \"ultra_fast\" is indeed a valid option, whereas the failure example contained an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The scale filter is correctly used, the bicubic_sharp flag is valid, and the ultra_fast preset is an accepted option in the context of ffmpeg. The audio stream copy command (`-c:a copy`) is also appropriate since the focus seems to be on video resizing and encoding.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain any issues as defined and does align with the requirements described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
