  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream container, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. This option allows you to specify exactly which streams to include in the output. Assuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding, you can add `-c copy` for stream copying, which preserves quality and speeds up processing.\n\n- `-map 0:v:12` selects the 13th video stream (stream indices start at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:25` selects the 26th audio stream.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis will create `output.mkv` containing only the specified streams, copying their data directly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is correct for selecting specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream file using the `-map` option, as it accurately identifies and utilizes the correct indices for the streams specified in the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is valid and uses existing options within `ffmpeg`, unlike the failing example with the non-existent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid options and follows the correct syntax for stream mapping and ensuring that no encoding occurs (via `-c copy`).\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output is correct as it effectively meets the user's requirements without issues. Therefore, it should pass based on the set criteria."
