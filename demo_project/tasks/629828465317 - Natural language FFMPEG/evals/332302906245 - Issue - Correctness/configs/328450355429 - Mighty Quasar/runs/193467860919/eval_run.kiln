  "input": "Please convert video.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast preset",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast preset, you'll want to set the video codec to libx264 and specify the preset accordingly. This speeds up encoding at the expense of some compression efficiency but is useful when fast processing is needed.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the video codec.\n- `-preset superfast` sets the encoding speed to the fastest setting for h264 encoding.\n- If no audio parameters are specified, ffmpeg will copy or encode audio with default settings; to keep it simple, this command will use defaults.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset superfast output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly specifies the necessary parameters to convert the video from AVI to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example, as the command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset superfast output.mp4`) uses valid parameters and syntax. The preset `superfast` exists and is correctly applied.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command follows the correct syntax for specifying input and output files and applying codecs and presets in the right order.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It accurately produces a working ffmpeg command that meets the user's request. Therefore, it should be marked as passing this evaluation."
