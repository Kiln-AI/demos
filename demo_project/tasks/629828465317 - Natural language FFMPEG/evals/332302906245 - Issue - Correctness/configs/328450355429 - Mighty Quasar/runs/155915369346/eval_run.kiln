  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To convert your vertical video (e.g., 9:16 aspect ratio) to a 16:9 widescreen format by adding blurred black bars to the left and right, we use the `scale` filter to resize the video height to 1080 pixels (a common 16:9 height), and then use the `crop` and `hstack` filters to add blurred bars on each side.\n\nKey points:\n- Set the output height to 1080p for a standard widescreen.\n- Calculate a suitable width to maintain 16:9 aspect ratio (width = height * 16/9 = 1920).\n- The original video will be scaled to fit the output height while preserving aspect ratio (width will be less than 1920).\n- To fill to 1920 width, use the `pad` filter with blurred copies of the original video on each side.\n- Create blurred sides by scaling the video to the full width and height, then applying a strong Gaussian blur.\n- The blurred images are added as left and right pads in conjunction with the original resized video in the center.\n- Use `boxblur` filter for blurring (faster than `gblur` and can be customized).\n\nAssuming:\n- Output resolution is 1920x1080.\n- Blurred left and right should be the same height as output and fit neatly on either side.\n\nHere's a command implementing this approach:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"\\\n  [0:v]scale=-1:h=1080[resized]; \\\n  [0:v]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=luma_radius=20:luma_power=1:luma_weight=0.5,format=gray[blurred]; \\\n  [blurred]colorchannelmixer=.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3:0,format=gray,eq=brightness=0.055[smooth_blur]; \\\n  [smooth_blur]geq='lum(0,0,0)+0.01*lum(0,0,0)'[blurred] \\\n  [resized][blurred]hstack=inputs=2[left]; \\\n  [blurred]hflip[right_blurred]; \\\n  [0:v]scale=-1:h=1080,boxblur=luma_radius=20:luma_power=1:luma_weight=0.5,format=gray[right_blurred]; \\\n  [right_blurred]colorchannelmixer=.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3:0:.3:.4:.3:0,format=gray,eq=brightness=0.055[right_blur]; \\\n  [resized][right_blur]hstack=inputs=2[right]; \\\n  [left][right]hstack=inputs=2[right_extended]; \\\n  [right_extended][right_blurred]overlay=W[out] \\\n  [out]crop=w=1920:h=1080\" -map \"[out]\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p output_16x9_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of steps:\n- [resized]: resized original video to height 1080 maintaining aspect ratio.\n- [blurred]: the original video scaled to 1920x1080, then blurred heavily with `boxblur`, converted to grayscale, and brightness increased slightly.\n- Hstack combines left blurred part, resized original, and right blurred part horizontally.\n- Video flipped horizontally for right side blurred image, then similarly processed.\n- Concatenate left blurred, resized original, and right blurred video horizontally.\n- Finally, overlay combined blurred images on the sides of the resized original video extended horizontally to fill 1920 width.\n\nThis approach ensures high quality and compatibility, and smooth blurring on the bars. If needed, you can tweak blur strength and scaling to better fit your original video's dimensions.\n\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain any issues related to the correctness of the `ffmpeg` command it generated. The command format adheres to the expected structure and includes various filters and parameters that are relevant to the task of adding blurred bars to a vertical video. Therefore, it should pass in this regard.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command does not contain any invalid options or parameters (e.g., `-preset extra_fast` which does not exist); thus, it does not fall into the category of incorrect command execution that would denote a failure.\n\n3) After reviewing the man page and the command generated by the model, there are no apparent violations of the requirements stipulated in the man page. The options used such as `-filter_complex`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, and `-pix_fmt` are valid, and the command follows the expected syntax for `ffmpeg`. The use of the `scale`, `boxblur`, and `hstack` filters seems appropriate for the intended transformation.\n\n4) Since the model's output contains no significant issues, it should pass based on the evaluation criteria outlined. The command appears to be valid, correct, and tailored to the user's request."
