  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "You want to select specific video and audio streams from a multi-track input file and combine them into a new output file. This involves specifying the input and output streams using the `-map` option.\n\n- `-map` specifies which streams to include in the output.  The format is `[input_file]:[stream_index]`.\n- We're selecting video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the input file.\n- The output file will be `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe command generated by the model is valid and correctly implements the user's request to select video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the multi-track input file for output. The use of the `-map` option and stream indices appears accurate. Therefore, the output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The command it generated does not contain any non-existent presets or invalid options, and the specified options are appropriate for the task at hand. Thus, the output does not resemble the failing example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly specifies the input file with `-i`, utilizes the `-map` option properly to select the desired streams, and employs the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is valid according to the documentation. The command structure adheres to FFmpeg's outlined usage and ordering of options, ensuring compliance with the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\nSince the modelâ€™s output is accurate, valid, and compliant with the requirements of the user's request and FFmpeg's documentation, the evaluation passes."
