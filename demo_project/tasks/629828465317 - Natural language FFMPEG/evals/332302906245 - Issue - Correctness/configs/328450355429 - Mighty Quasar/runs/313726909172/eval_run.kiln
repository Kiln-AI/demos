  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo convert an MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec (VP9) for web streaming, here are the key steps and considerations:\n\n- libvpx (VP9) offers high quality at low bitrates, making it suitable for web streaming.\n- MP4 containers support VP9 video up to VP9 profile 313 (level 3.0), but generally, MP4 works best for lower profile VP9 videos. For more advanced VP9 features, webm is more suitable.\n- A one-pass encoding is typically used for this context (e.g., -cpu-used and -deadline options).\n- For audio, AAC is a standard and widely compatible format.\n\nTypical usage might look like this if you use one-pass encoding for faster results (less quality), or two passes for better visual quality, but generally, one pass is used for most practical applications.\n\nAssuming you want a good balance between quality and file size, we'll use a target bitrate of ~2.5M for good 1080p VP9.\n\nExample command for single pass encoding:\n\n- -c:v libvpx for video codec.\n- -b:v 2500k for bitrate.\n- -cpu-used 4 to 6 (affects speed/quality tradeoff; 4 is fast, 6 is slower but better quality).\n- -deadline real-time for fast encoding.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k for high-quality audio.\n\nSo, hereâ€™s the command.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx -b:v 2500k -cpu-used 4 -deadline realtime -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes the MKV video is not too complex to compress and the system supports VP9 MP4 export (FFmpeg 4.3+ likely supports VP9 in MP4). For a reliable VP9 output, webm is recommended, but for the request, MP4 VP9 is attempted.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for converting an MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec, which is suitable for web streaming.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx -b:v 2500k -cpu-used 4 -deadline realtime -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output.mp4` is valid and uses appropriate options. There are no incorrect or non-existent parameters in the command.\n\n3) The command provided by the model does not break any requirements as dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax and options used align correctly with the FFmpeg guidelines. The command specifies input and output files along with the appropriate codec and parameters.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues and generates a correct command following the user's input, it should pass the evaluation. The command is valid, correct, and matches the user's requirements for converting MKV to MP4 with web-optimized settings using the libvpx codec."
