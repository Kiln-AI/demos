  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the -map option to select the desired streams:\n\n- -map 0:1 selects the second video stream from input.avi (stream index 0:1).\n- -map 0:3 selects the fourth audio track from the same input.\n- To avoid re-encoding and preserve only the selected streams, use -c copy.\n\nAssumption:\n- The second video and fourth audio streams are compatible with MP4 container formats. If not, re-encoding might be necessary, but as per the instruction, stream extraction and copy is requested.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4`) correctly reflects the requirement to extract the specified video and audio streams and uses the appropriate parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The output provided is clear, logical, and does not contain any erroneous or non-existent command parameters like the `extra_fast` preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly states the input file using `-i input.avi`, uses `-map` to specify the desired streams, and employs `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding. All given parameters are correct and adhere to ffmpeg's usage instructions.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issues described. Therefore, it should pass as it achieved the task as specified without errors."
