  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert video.mkv to MP4 with a 4K resolution (3840x2160) and compress it for a very small file suitable for email, you'll need to upscale if the original is lower resolution (not recommended for quality, but required if enforcing 4K), use aggressive compression (higher CRF), and limit the bitrate. \n\n- -vf scale=3840:2160 forces 4K resolution.\n- -c:v libx264 encodes with H.264 (widely compatible).\n- -preset veryslow or slower achieves better compression (choose based on encoding time vs. size).\n- -crf 30 (higher number = smaller file, lower quality; adjust as needed—30 is quite aggressive).\n- -maxrate and -bufsize limit spikes in bitrate, helping keep file size under control.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 96k keeps audio small but reasonable.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p for compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart for web/email streaming.\n\n**Assumption:** You want best possible quality at 4K for the smallest size, and the final file should be as compatible as possible for email/video preview.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 30 -maxrate 2M -bufsize 4M -c:a aac -b:a 96k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_4k_compressed.mp4\n```\n\n**Tips:** \n- Adjust `-crf` (e.g., 28–32) and `-maxrate` for smaller/larger files, as needed.\n- Check output file size; for large videos, even aggressive compression may not yield files small enough for email—consider trimming or splitting if necessary.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the `<issue_description>`. The command it generated is valid and adheres to the specifications for converting a video file from MKV to MP4 format with a specified resolution and compression settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in `<failure_example>`. The command does not contain any invalid options or parameters, and all the ffmpeg options utilized are valid and applicable.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, there are no violations of the requirements. The command structure is correct, and all specified parameters are applicable for the tasks described—compressing the video while maintaining specific resolution and format.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a valid ffmpeg command that correctly meets the user's request. Hence, it should pass the evaluation criteria."
