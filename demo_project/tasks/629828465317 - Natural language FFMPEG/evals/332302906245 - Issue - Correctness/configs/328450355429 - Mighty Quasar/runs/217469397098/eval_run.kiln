  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 with 720p resolution, but I need both variable bitrate encoding and fixed bitrate of 2000k for consistent streaming.",
  "output": "To meet both streaming needs and manage quality/bitrate, you typically choose one: variable bitrate (VBR) or constant bitrate (CBR). For browser streaming and efficiency, VBR with a target average bitrate works best. Here, we'll set H.264 encoding with:\n\n- -b:v 2000k: sets the target average video bitrate to 2000 kbps.\n- -maxrate 2000k -minrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k: attempts CBR for consistent streaming, but still allows some flexibility (best practice for streaming).\n- -preset fast and -crf 23: balance quality and speed (CRF is used even with CBR settings; for strict CBR, omit -crf).\n- -vf scale=-2:720 resizes video to 720p, keeping aspect ratio.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: encodes audio to AAC at 128 kbps.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: maximizes compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart: crucial for MP4 streaming.\n\nAssuming you want as close to true CBR as practical for streaming, here's the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -b:v 2000k -maxrate 2000k -minrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want true VBR (for best efficiency), remove `-minrate 2000k -maxrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k`, but for consistent streaming, the above CBR-like setup is best.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The ffmpeg command generated looks valid and implements the user's request for converting the video to MP4 with 720p resolution and specific encoding settings (variable bitrate with a target bitrate and some semblance of constant bitrate characteristics).\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model does not use an invalid preset or a non-existent command. It uses valid parameters for ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The video encoding options used (like `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-minrate`, and `-bufsize`) are correctly applied following the syntax rules outlined in the man page. \n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain an issue, and therefore it should pass."
