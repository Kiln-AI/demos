  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To chain multiple video filters in ffmpeg, use the `-vf` (video filter) option with filters separated by commas. For text overlay and blur effects, you'll use the `drawtext` and `boxblur` filters.\n\nThe order matters: filters are applied sequentially from left to right. I'll assume you want to blur the video first, then add text on top (so the text remains sharp). If you want the text to be blurred too, reverse the order.\n\nHere's the syntax for chaining filters:\n- Filters are separated by commas (`,`)\n- Each filter has its own parameters separated by colons (`:`)\n- Text parameters should be escaped or quoted if they contain spaces\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur=5:1,drawtext=text='Your Text Here':fontsize=24:fontcolor=white:x=10:y=10\" output.mp4\n```\n\nBreakdown of the filters:\n- `boxblur=5:1` applies a blur with radius 5 and 1 iteration (increase for more blur)\n- `drawtext=text='Your Text Here'` overlays text\n- `fontsize=24` sets text size\n- `fontcolor=white` sets text color\n- `x=10:y=10` positions text 10 pixels from top-left corner\n\nYou can also use more complex positioning like `x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2` to center the text, where `w` is video width, `h` is video height, `text_w` is text width, and `text_h` is text height.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command provided seems syntactically correct for the task of chaining multiple filters with the appropriate syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output command correctly includes valid ffmpeg syntax and valid options for the specified filters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-vf` with the filters `boxblur` and `drawtext` is correct and follows the specifications outlined in the man page for applying video filters.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes and does not contain any errors in accordance with the provided example and the man page. The command effectively addresses the user's request for chaining multiple video filters in ffmpeg."
