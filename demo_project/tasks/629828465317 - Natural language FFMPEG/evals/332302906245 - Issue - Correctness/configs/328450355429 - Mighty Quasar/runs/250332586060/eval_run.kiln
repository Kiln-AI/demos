  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file and map them into a single output file, you can use the `-map` option with the stream specifier. Assuming that the third video stream is labeled as `0:2` (ffmpeg uses 0-based indexing) and the second audio stream as `0:1`, you can map these streams as follows:\n\n- `-map 0:2` selects the third video stream from the input file.\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second audio stream from the input file.\n- The output filename `final.mp4` is specified last, which will automatically use the chosen streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:2 -map 0:1 final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will automatically copy the selected streams into `final.mp4` without re-encoding, assuming this is what you want. If you want to apply encoding or other transformations, you'll need to specify codecs and other options appropriately, similar to the example you provided earlier.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly utilizes the `-map` option to specify the desired video and audio streams from the input file `multi.avi`, and it produces the output file `final.mp4` as requested by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command it generated does not contain any incorrect options, such as an invalid preset like `extra_fast`. Therefore, it is not indicative of a failing output.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any of the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly applies the mapping options as outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generated a correct and valid ffmpeg command that aligns with the user's request, signaling that it has performed well."
