  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To apply a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) in sequence using `ffmpeg`, you need to use the `filter_complex` option with a chain of filters. Here's how it works:\n\n- `fps=30` ensures the output frames per second is consistent.\n- `unsharp=5:5:1:5:5:1` applies a basic sharpening filter (you can replace this with a more sophisticated color grading chain if needed).\n- `rotate=90` rotates the video by 90 degrees.\n- `scale=1280:720` scales the video to a specific resolution.\n- `setpts=0.5*PTS` speeds up the video by half (optional; adjust as needed).\n- `format=yuv420p` ensures compatibility across devices.\n\nAssumptions made: The rotation and scaling are applied in that order, and the stabilization is handled using the `unsharp` filter (though more advanced stabilization can be done with `vstab` or `hqdn3d`). This is a simplified example; for more detailed color grading, you could use `eq`, `contrast`, `brightness`, or `hue`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"fps=30,unsharp=5:5:1:5:5:1,rotate=90,scale=1280:720,setpts=0.5*PTS\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: If you're aiming for more in-depth color grading, consider using a combination of filters like `eq`, `contrast`, `brightness`, and `gamma` in the `filter_complex` chain.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue related to the order and use of the filters in the ffmpeg command. Specifically, it suggests using `unsharp` for stabilization, which is not appropriate, as `unsharp` is a sharpening filter, not a stabilization filter. Stabilization should typically be handled by a specific stabilization filter like `vidstab` or other methods. Additionally, the order of operations in the filter chain may not yield the intended result for the user's requirements, as stabilization should ideally be handled before other transformations to ensure the following processing applies to a stabilized image.\n\n2) The model's output is not very similar to the failure example given. The command generated does not contain any clearly invalid options like a nonexistent preset. However, it contains the incorrect use of filters, which can lead to undesirable results but doesn't technically render the command invalid as per ffmpeg's syntax.\n\n3) The command does not appear to break any explicit requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg in terms of syntax. It uses valid ffmpeg options and parameters, but the choice of filters is misleading and not performing as intended given the user's requirement for stabilization.\n\n4) Given the presence of an inappropriate filter (unsharp) used as a substitute for stabilization and potential issues with the order of filters applied, the model's output fails to adequately meet the user's requirements as described in the issue description. Thus, it contains the issue described."
