  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from input.mov and create a single output. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that ffmpeg uses stream indices starting from 0. So the 7th video stream would be index 6, and the 14th audio stream would be index 13. Wait, but how do I specify which streams to take?\n\nI think the -map option is used here. So they need to map the 7th video stream (which is index 6) and the 14th audio stream (index 13). But wait, does the user mean the 7th video stream in the file, which might not be the same as the index? Or are they counting from 1? Like, if there are multiple video streams, the 7th one. But the user says \"7th video stream\" and \"14th audio stream\", so they probably mean the 7th video track and 14th audio track. But how does ffmpeg handle that?\n\nWait, in ffmpeg, the -map option can take stream indices. So if there are multiple streams, you can specify them by their index. But the user might be using 1-based indexing. So the 7th video stream would be index 6 (since starting at 0). But I need to check if that's the case. Also, the user might have multiple audio streams, so the 14th audio stream would be index 13. But I need to make sure that the input file actually has at least 14 audio streams. Otherwise, this would fail.\n\nAlso, the user wants to create a single output. So the output will have one video stream (the 7th video) and one audio stream (the 14th audio). So the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 6:v -map 13:a -c copy output.mp4\n\nWait, but in ffmpeg, the -map option can take the stream index. So for video streams, you can specify the index with a 'v' type. So -map 6:v would map the 7th video stream (since 0-based). Similarly, -map 13:a would map the 14th audio stream. But wait, maybe the user is using 1-based numbering. So the 7th video stream would be index 6 (0-based), and the 14th audio stream is index 13. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 6:v -map 13:a -c copy output.mp4\n\nBut I should check if that's correct. Also, the user might not have specified the output format, so maybe they want the same as the input? Or maybe they want a specific format. But since they didn't specify, using -c copy would copy the streams without re-encoding, which is efficient. However, if the output format isn't specified, ffmpeg might default to the same as input. But to be safe, maybe specify the output format. Wait, but the user didn't mention that, so perhaps they just want to copy the streams as is.\n\nBut wait, if the input is MOV, which is usually a container format, and the output is going to be another container. So maybe the user wants to output as MP4? Or just keep the same container? But since they didn't specify, maybe using -c copy is okay. However, sometimes when copying streams, the container might not support all stream combinations. So maybe the user should check if the output container can hold both the video and audio streams. But the user hasn't mentioned that. So I'll proceed with the command as is.\n\nSo the final answer would be to use -map with the indices for the 7th video and 14th audio streams, copy the streams, and output the file. But need to make sure that the user knows that the indices are 0-based. So in the explanation, I should clarify that the 7th video stream is index 6 and the 14th audio is index 13. Also, the user should ensure that the input file has those streams. Otherwise, the command will fail.\n\nAlso, the user might have multiple streams, so maybe the command is correct. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 6:v -map 13:a -c copy output.mp4\n\nBut wait, the user might need to specify the output format. If the input is MOV and the output is MP4, but the user didn't specify, but using -c copy would copy the streams into the same container. However, if the output is the same container, then it's okay. But maybe the user wants a different container. However, since the user didn't specify, perhaps the output can be in the same format. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to output as MP4. But without more info, I'll proceed with the command as written.\n\nSo the explanation would be that the user needs to map the 7th video stream (index 6) and 14th audio stream (index 13) using -map, then copy the streams with -c copy. Also, note that the indices are 0-based, and if the input doesn't have those streams, the command will fail.\n</think>\n\nTo map the 7th video stream (stream index 6) and the 14th audio stream (stream index 13) from `input.mov` and create a single output file, use the `-map` option to select specific streams. The indices are 0-based, so the 7th video stream is index 6 (`-map 6:v`), and the 14th audio stream is index 13 (`-map 13:a`). The `-c copy` flag copies streams without re-encoding, preserving original codecs and quality.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The input file `input.mov` contains at least 14 audio streams and 7 video streams.\n- You want to preserve the original codecs and avoid re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 6:v -map 13:a -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis command will produce `output.mov` containing only the specified video and audio streams. If you need a different container (e.g., MP4), replace `output.mov` with `output.mp4` or specify the output format explicitly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is logically correct in terms of syntax and follows the mapping requirements specified by the user, addressing the need to map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream properly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command it produced is valid and structured correctly. It does not include any parameters that are known to be incorrect or nonexistent (like the incorrect preset in the failure example).\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses the correct syntax for stream mapping (`-map`) and uses the `-c copy` option appropriately for copying without re-encoding, which is consistent with the requirements for ffmpeg commands. The model also correctly identifies that the indices are based on zero-indexing and makes appropriate assumptions regarding the presence of the specified streams in the input file.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly generates a valid command within the constraints provided and does not violate any ffmpeg command syntax rules or options listed in the man page. \n\nThus, the evaluation result passes."
