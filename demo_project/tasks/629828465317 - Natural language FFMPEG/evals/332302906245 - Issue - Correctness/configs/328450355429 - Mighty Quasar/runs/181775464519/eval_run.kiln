  "output": "To extract audio track 5 and combine it with the video from the same file, you'll need to use stream mapping to specify which streams to include in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v` selects the first video stream from the input file\n- `-map 0:a:4` selects the 5th audio stream (0-indexed, so audio stream 4 = track 5)\n- `-c copy` copies both streams without re-encoding for faster processing and no quality loss\n\nThis assumes you want to keep only one video stream (the first one) and replace all audio with just track 5. If your file has multiple video streams and you want a specific one, replace `0:v` with `0:v:0` (first video) or the appropriate index.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:4 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nIf you need to re-encode for compatibility reasons instead of copying streams directly, replace `-c copy` with appropriate codec settings like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated for extracting audio track 5 and mapping it with the video is valid and correctly meets the requirements stated by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The generated command is syntactically correct, and there are no invalid options such as an incorrectly named preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are applicable and correctly specify stream mapping and codec options as per the syntax rules outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not exhibit the issues as described, it passes the evaluation overall."
