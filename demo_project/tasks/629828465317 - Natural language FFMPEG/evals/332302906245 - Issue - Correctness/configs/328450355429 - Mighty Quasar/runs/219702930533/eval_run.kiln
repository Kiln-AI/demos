  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode `input.mp4` into an AVI file using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding, you'll need to run `ffmpeg` twice: once to gather statistics about the input file (first pass), and a second time to encode the file using those statistics (second pass).\n\n- `c:v libvp9` sets the video codec to VP9.\n- `b:v 0` sets the bitrate to 0, forcing VP9 to encode using the quality-based mode (controlled by `crf` or `qmin`, `qmax`).\n- `-qmin 4` and `-qmax 63` sets the minimum and maximum quality.\n- `-pass 1` for the first pass.\n- `-pass 2` for the second pass.\n\nHere are the commands for the two passes:\n\n```bash\n# First pass\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libvp9 -b:v 0 -qmin 4 -qmax 63 -pass 1 -f null NUL\n\n# Second pass\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvp9 -b:v 0 -qmin 4 -qmax 63 -pass 2 output.avi\n```\nPlease note, using libvp9 in AVI container might cause problems due to AVI's poor support for modern codecs. It's recommended to use the more modern container formats like Matroska (.mkv) or WebM (.webm) for VP9 video.\n\nAlso, do not forget to replace `NUL` with `/dev/null` if you're on a Unix-like system (not on Windows).\n\nI'm also assuming that you have a suitable quality setting. If you're unsure about the quality, try adjusting `-qmin` and `-qmax`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description. It suggests transcoding to an AVI format using the VP9 codec, which is known to have poor support in the AVI container. Using modern container formats like MKV or WebM is typically recommended for such codecs. This could potentially lead to problems during playback or compatibility issues.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is structurally valid and does not contain any clearly wrong parameters in terms of syntax.\n\n3) The command does not directly violate any specific requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. However, the recommendation about using AVI with the VP9 codec is a significant issue, as it contradicts best practices, even if the commands themselves function correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does contain an issue because it fails to provide a suitable codec-container pairing for the userâ€™s request. Therefore, it should fail the evaluation."
