  "input": "Extract frames from my video at 5fps and save as PNG images using the lossless_max preset",
  "output": "To extract frames at 5 frames per second (fps) and save them as PNG images, you set the input frame rate with the `-r` option before input to select frames from the video accordingly, or use the `-vf fps=5` filter after input. PNG format is lossless by default, but if you want to use the `lossless_max` preset for PNG encoding (which is a specific libpng preset), you set the PNG encoding options with `-compression_level 9` (maximum compression) and possibly `-pred mixed` etc., but ffmpeg PNG encoder primarily uses `-compression_level`. \n\nAssuming you want the highest compression (lossless_max) for PNGs, use `-compression_level 9`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf fps=5 -compression_level 9 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf fps=5` extracts frames at 5 fps.\n- `-compression_level 9` sets maximum compression for PNG, which is lossless.\n- Frames are saved as PNG files named frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, etc.\n\nIf your input filename is different, replace `input.mp4` with the actual filename.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain issues described in the issue description. It generates a command that correctly extracts frames from a video at 5 fps and saves them as PNG images using the maximum lossless compression. The parameters used in the command are appropriate for the requested transformation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and correctly structured for the task at hand. There are no invalid presets or options present in the command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (`-i`, `-vf fps=5`, and `-compression_level 9`) are appropriately applied and follow the guidelines. The order of the options is respected, and there are no unsupported presets or commands in the output.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes the evaluation criteria. It correctly generates an ffmpeg command that effectively performs the specified task. There are no errors or misconfigurations in the command."
