  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To make a vertical video (likely 9:16 aspect ratio) fit a 16:9 canvas by adding blurred bars on the sides, you can:\n\n- Use `scale` to resize the video height to the output height (e.g., 1080p or original height if known).\n- Use `boxblur` filter to create a blurred version of the video for the background.\n- Use `crop` and `scale` to fit the original video centered on top.\n- Use `overlay` to place the original video over the blurred background.\n\nAssuming you want a 1920x1080 16:9 output resolution. Adjust the scale if your vertical video has a height other than 1080.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"\\\n[0:v]scale=-2:1080,boxblur=10:1[bg]; \\\n[0:v]scale=-2:1080[fg]; \\\n[bg][fg]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2:format=auto,format=yuv420p\\\n\" -c:a copy output_16_9_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `[0:v]scale=-2:1080` scales the input video to height 1080 maintaining aspect ratio (width auto).\n- `boxblur=10:1` applies horizontal blur to background.\n- Another scaled copy `[fg]` for foreground (sharp video).\n- The overlay centers the original video over the blurred background.\n- `format=yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility.\n- Audio is copied as-is.\n\nIf your original vertical video has a different height, replace 1080 with the desired height.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command seems to fulfill the user's request by providing a valid command to create a 16:9 video from a vertical video by adding blurred bars on the sides.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not include any invalid flags or options like the `extra_fast` preset which does not exist. The options used in the command are valid according to the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used (`scale`, `boxblur`, `overlay`, etc.) are all valid and correspond to standard filters and arguments that can be used with `ffmpeg`. The use of `-c:a copy` is also appropriate as it indicates that the audio stream should be copied without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output should pass as it does not contain any issues identified in the described scenario. The command appears to be correctly formulated and aligns well with the user's request and `ffmpeg` documentation."
