  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a media file using ffmpeg, you can specify the stream indices with `-map`. Stream indices are zero-based, so stream 15 is `-map 15` for video and stream 22 is `-map 22` for audio. This extracts only those streams into the output.\n\nAssuming you want to keep only those particular streams, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 15 -map 22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 15` select the 16th stream (video).\n- `-map 22` select the 23rd stream (audio).\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding, preserving original quality and speeding up the process.\n- `output.mkv` is the resulting file with only the specified streams.\n\nIf you want to convert or re-encode the streams, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues. The generated command correctly selects streams 15 and 22 from the input file source.mkv and uses the `-map` option appropriately.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example, as it does not contain any incorrect parameters or unsupported options. The command and explanations are all valid.\n\n3) The command provided by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are standard and applicable in the context of the task given.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a valid command without any mistakes that would lead to a failure in execution. Therefore, this output passes the evaluation criteria."
