  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To set a very high video bitrate and audio bitrate in your conversion, use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options to specify the desired bitrates. Here, `-b:v 100000k` sets the video bitrate to 100000 kbps (100 Mbps), which is extremely high and suitable for very high-quality output or professional workflows. `-b:a 512k` sets the audio bitrate to 512 kbps for very high audio quality.\n\nNote that using a constant bitrate like this can lead to large files and may reduce compression efficiency compared to CRF mode. Make sure your output format and player support such high bitrates.\n\nExample command based on input.mp4 to output.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with your actual input and output filenames.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated accurately reflects the requirement of setting a very high bitrate for both video (100000k) and audio (512k). The use of `-b:v` for setting video bitrate and `-b:a` for audio bitrate is correct. Therefore, the model's output meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated by the model does not include any nonsensical options, and `-preset extra_fast` is not among the parameters provided. The command is logically constructed and uses valid options supported by `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used in the command (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`) are all valid options for setting bitrates and specifying codecs. There are no issues with the order of the options or the syntax.\n\n4) Considering the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass."
