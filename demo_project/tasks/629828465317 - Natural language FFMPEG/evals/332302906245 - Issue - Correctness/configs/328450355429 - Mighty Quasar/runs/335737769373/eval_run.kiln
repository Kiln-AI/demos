  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-track file, use the `-map` parameter to specify which streams to include in the output. This allows you to choose exactly which video and audio tracks you want from the source file.\n\n- `-map 0:15` selects stream 15 from the first input file (0) as the video stream\n- `-map 0:22` selects stream 22 from the first input file (0) as the audio stream\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest option, preserves original quality)\n\nIf you need to re-encode for compatibility or size reasons, you can replace `-c copy` with specific codec options like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated matches the requirements of the user to select specific streams from an input file using the correct `-map` syntax, and it uses `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding while preserving quality.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and uses correct parameters. The use of `-map` and `-c copy` is appropriate, and there are no non-existent options or syntax errors present.\n\n3) Based on the FFmpeg man page, the command correctly adheres to the specified requirements. The use of `-map 0:15` and `-map 0:22` for selecting specific video and audio streams, respectively, is consistent with the documentation. The command structure follows the rules outlined in the man page, including the correct placement of the `-i` option for specifying the input file and mapping options before the output file command.\n\n4) Since the output does **not** contain the issue outlined, I would conclude that the model successfully passes this evaluation. The generated command is correct, follows the syntax outlined in the provided documentation, and meets the user's requirements effectively. Overall, the output demonstrates a good understanding of the task."
