  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from an input file to an output file using ffmpeg, you use the `-map` option followed by the stream specifier. Here, you want video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5.\n\nThis command assumes stream 0:3 is a video stream and 0:5 is an audio stream. The command copies the streams without re-encoding to preserve original quality and speed up processing. If you need to re-encode for compatibility, let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:3` picks the video stream at index 3 from input 0.\n- `-map 0:5` picks the audio stream at index 5 from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- Output is `edited.mp4` as requested.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated effectively maps specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file, adhering to the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is correct and does not contain invalid options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify which streams to select and includes the `-c copy` option for direct copying without re-encoding, complying with standard practices for stream manipulation in ffmpeg.\n\n4) Given that the model's output meets the user's request accurately and adheres to the ffmpeg command structure and rules, it passes the evaluation. There are no issues in the generated command."
