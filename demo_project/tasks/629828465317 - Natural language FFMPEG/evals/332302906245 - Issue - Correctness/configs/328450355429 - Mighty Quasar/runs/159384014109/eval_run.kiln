  "output": "To combine a specific video stream (0:2) and audio stream (1:3) from your input file into a single MP4, use ffmpeg's stream selection with -map. This way, you can specify exactly which streams to include, ignoring others.\n\n- -map 0:2 selects the third stream (stream numbering starts from 0) from input 0 for video.\n- -map 1:3 selects the fourth stream from input 1 for audio.\n- Codecs are automatically copied if compatible; otherwise, specify -c:v copy and -c:a copy for stream copying to avoid re-encoding and preserve quality.\n\nAssuming you want to copy streams directly without re-encoding for efficiency:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output correctly constructs an `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's requirement for combining specific streams from the input file. The explanation provided aligns with the command generated, including the use of `-map` options and the codecs for copying the streams. Hence, the model's output **does not contain the issue described**.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) as it correctly follows `ffmpeg` syntax and uses valid options (`-map`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`). Therefore, the output does **not resemble a failing output sample**.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command constructed by the model adheres to the requirements set forth in the `ffmpeg` man page. The use of `-map` is consistent with the documentation, and the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options are valid for copying streams without re-encoding. The command structure follows the application of options shown in the examples. Thus, the command **does not break any requirements from the man page**.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nBased on the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The command it generated correctly meets the user's needs and adheres to `ffmpeg` syntax and functionality. Therefore, it should **pass**."
