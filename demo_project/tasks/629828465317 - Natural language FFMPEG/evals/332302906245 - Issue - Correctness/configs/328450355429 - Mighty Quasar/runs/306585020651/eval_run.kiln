  "output": "To add new subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you'll need to use the `-map` option to exclude existing subtitles and then add your new subtitle file.\n\n- `-map 0:v` maps only the video stream from the input\n- `-map 0:a` maps only the audio stream(s) from the input  \n- `-map 1` maps the subtitle file as the second input\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies video/audio without re-encoding for speed\n- `-c:s mov_text` encodes subtitles in MP4-compatible format (use `srt` for MKV containers)\n\nI'm assuming you have a subtitle file (like .srt) and want to embed it into an MP4 container. If you want different subtitle formats or containers, the subtitle codec may need to change.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to burn the subtitles directly into the video (making them permanent and unremovable), use this instead:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command for adding subtitles and removing existing subtitle tracks correctly specifies the necessary options to achieve the userâ€™s request.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated by the model uses valid `ffmpeg` syntax and available options, while the failure example is marked by an invalid `preset` option that does not exist.\n\n3) Based on the `ffmpeg` man page, the command complies with the requirements. The model specifies the correct usage of `-map` to select video and audio streams, while excluding existing subtitles, and successfully adds new subtitles using valid codecs. The assumption about wanting to embed the subtitles within an MP4 container format is reasonable and consistent with normal use cases.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue, as it generates a valid command that meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
