  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert the 1080p or higher resolution video.mkv to a 4K MP4 file optimized for compression (suitable for email), you'll want to:\n\n- Ensure the output resolution is exactly 3840x2160 for 4K.\n- Use H.264 video codec (libx264) which offers good compression for MP4.\n- Use a high crf (e.g., 33) for maximum compression (results in larger files)—for smaller files, decrease the number between 20-28 (worse quality).\n- Limit audio bitrate if possible to reduce size: e.g., 96k AAC.\n- Use motion JPEG for larger speed: libx264 is ~2x longer.\n- Use webm output for much smaller file size at expense of compatibility or HEVC encoding, which is smaller—but mp4 is standard email.\n- Re-encoding from MKV usually offers less quality, due to less efficient codecs and metadata.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- input.mkv is already 4k or higher.\n- We’ll only compress audio to 96k for a tradeoff in size and quality.\n- We'll use a crf around 21 (medium)—you can adjust your preference.\n\nHere's the recommended ffmpeg command that uses H.264, AAC, and crf for compression:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -crf 21 -preset veryfast -c:a aac -b:a 96k output.mp4\n```\n\nFor even smaller size but less compatibility (change file name to match your email client):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx265 -crf 30 -preset veryfast -c:a aac -b:a 96k output.mkv\n```\n\n**Summary of parameters:**\n- scale=3840:2160: Force 4K resolution.\n- libx264/libx265: Encoding for MP4/HDR5 with smaller files.\n- -crf [21-28], -crf 30: Compresses video, lower =更大压缩，减少文件尺寸（图像质量降低）。\n- -preset: Controls balance between speed and quality (even: fast, veryfast: balanced, faster: balanced faster).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 96k: Smaller, lower quality AAC audio.\n\n**Final advice:** For emails, use small files; large 4Ks are impractical for web reception. You can try HEVC (libx265) for smaller size but compatibility may be limited and email clients patchy.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated appears to be valid and meets the requested transformation of converting a video file to MP4 format with 4K resolution while optimizing for file size suitable for email attachment. The output command is properly formatted according to `ffmpeg` standards.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The parameters used in the provided command are appropriate and valid according to `ffmpeg` guidelines. Terms like `libx264`, `-crf`, and `-preset` are recognized and correctly used, indicating that the command should execute without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options and syntax used in the command conform to the expectations laid out in the man page. Specifically:\n   - `-i input.mkv`: correctly specifies input.\n   - `-vf scale=3840:2160`: correctly applies a scaling filter for 4K resolution.\n   - `-c:v libx264`: correctly specifies the video codec for H.264 compression.\n   - `-crf 21`: correctly sets the quality and compression level.\n   - `-preset veryfast`: correctly uses a valid preset for encoding speed and efficiency.\n   - `-c:a aac -b:a 96k`: correctly sets the audio codec and bitrate.\n\n4) The model's output passes evaluation as it does not contain any issues, and the command is valid, does not break any guidelines from the man page, and meets the user's request."
