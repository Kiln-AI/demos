  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To efficiently merge multiple video files without re-encoding (thus preserving quality and processing speed), all input files should have the same codec, resolution, and framerate. Assuming part1.mp4, part2.mp4, and part3.mp4 meet these criteria, you can use ffmpeg's \"concat demuxer\" method.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Create a text file (e.g., files.txt) listing the files to merge:\n   ```\n   file 'part1.mp4'\n   file 'part2.mp4'\n   file 'part3.mp4'\n   ```\n2. Run ffmpeg with the concat demuxer:\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-f concat` tells ffmpeg to use the concat demuxer.\n- `-safe 0` allows absolute paths or unconventional filenames in files.txt.\n- `-i files.txt` is the list of files to concatenate.\n- `-c copy` avoids re-encoding, making the process fast and lossless.\n\nIf your files differ in codec, resolution or framerate, re-encoding will be necessary, but for best practice, it's ideal to merge files with consistent formats as shown above.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for merging multiple video files using the concat demuxer, which is a valid method assuming the input files meet the necessary criteria (same codec, resolution, and framerate). The command itself does not break the rules set in the man page and should execute correctly if proper conditions are met.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given. The command generated does not contain any obviously invalid options or erroneous parameters. The command seems to be constructed correctly based on the provided user message.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements outlined in the man page. The use of `-f concat`, `-safe 0`, and `-c copy` is compliant with the expected usage for concatenating video files without re-encoding. Given that the explanation assumes consistency among the input files, the command should work properly as indicated.\n\n4) Considering all the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, as it generates a valid command based on the task requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
