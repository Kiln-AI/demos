  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-track video file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to choose specific video and audio tracks from the source file.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects video stream 6 from the input file (0-indexed, so this is the 7th video stream)\n- `-map 0:a:9` selects audio stream 9 from the input file (0-indexed, so this is the 10th audio stream)\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest option, assuming the codecs are already compatible with MP4)\n\nI'm assuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding. If you need to re-encode for compatibility or quality reasons, you can replace `-c copy` with specific codecs like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need to re-encode for MP4 compatibility:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation prompt. The provided command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams and uses the `-c copy` parameter to avoid re-encoding, assuming the streams are compatible with the output format. There are no mistakes in the syntax or structure that would cause the command to fail.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it generated correctly specifies valid stream mappings and uses options that are consistent with the FFmpeg documentation. There are no incorrect options like the nonexistent `extra_fast` preset in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the desired video and audio streams and includes the `-c copy` option for stream copying. The output file format specified as `.mp4` is also appropriate for the codec types being used. No invalid options or sequences are present.\n\nOverall, the model's output is correct, follows the guidelines provided, and adheres to the requirements of the FFmpeg command. The command generated works correctly according to the user's request and FFmpeg's capabilities. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
