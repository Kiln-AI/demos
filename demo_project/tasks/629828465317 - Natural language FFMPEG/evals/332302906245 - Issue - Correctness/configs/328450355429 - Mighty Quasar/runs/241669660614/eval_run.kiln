  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio and video filters together. Use -vf 'scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0' -af 'volume=2.0,highpass=f=200' to scale, sharpen, increase volume and apply high-pass filter.",
  "output": "To apply multiple **video and audio filters** together using FFmpeg, you can chain them using commas within the `-vf` (video filters) and `-af` (audio filters) options:\n\n- **scale=640:480**: Resizes the video to 640x480 pixels. Note that you should ensure the correct aspect ratio is maintained if needed.\n- **unsharp=5:5:1.0**: Applies a sharpening filter to enhance edges. Parameters are `luma_radius`, `luma_amount`, and `chroma_radius`/`amount` (when variables are omitted, they default to the luma values).\n- **volume=2.0**: Doubles the audio volume.\n- **highpass=f=200**: Applies a high-pass filter, allowing frequencies above 200 Hz to pass through and attenuating lower frequencies.\n\nThe following command applies all these transformations in a single FFmpeg pipeline:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0' -af 'volume=2.0,highpass=f=200' output.mp4\n``` \n\n### Assumptions:\n- The aspect ratio of the original content matches 640:480 or you're okay with stretching the video.\n- You want to retain the original video and audio streams while applying these filters, and do not need audio resampling or format conversion. If needed, additional parameters can be added.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command accurately reflects the user's request to apply multiple audio and video filters. The command includes proper syntax and usage of options related to the filters specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not include any non-existent options or incorrect syntax that would cause it to fail. It utilizes valid parameters for both the video and audio filters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The filters specified (`scale`, `unsharp`, `volume`, and `highpass`) are valid and correctly applied according to the documentation. The order of options is also appropriate; video filters are applied before the audio filters as per FFmpeg's requirement.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output is appropriate and does not present any issues related to command correctness or validity according to FFmpeg's specifications. Therefore, it should pass."
