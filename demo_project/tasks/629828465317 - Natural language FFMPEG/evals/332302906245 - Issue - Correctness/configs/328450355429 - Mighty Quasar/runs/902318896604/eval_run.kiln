  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user's request. They have a video file, movie.mkv, with multiple audio tracks and want to map the third audio stream to the output while keeping the original video. \n\nFirst, I need to remember how ffmpeg handles multiple audio streams. By default, if you don't specify, ffmpeg will take the first audio stream. But the user wants the third one. So I need to use the -map option to select specific streams.\n\nThe input is movie.mkv, which is a container that can hold multiple audio streams. The user wants to keep the original video, so I should map the video stream as well. The third audio track would be referenced as 0:a:2 since ffmpeg uses 0-based indexing. Wait, let me confirm: in ffmpeg, streams are numbered starting from 0. So the first audio stream is 0:a:0, the second is 0:a:1, and the third is 0:a:2. So mapping the third audio track would be -map 0:a:2.\n\nFor the video, the user wants to keep the original, so I should map the video stream. The video stream is typically 0:v:0. So -map 0:v:0.\n\nThen, the output file. The user didn't specify the output format, but since the input is MKV, maybe they want to keep it as MKV. But sometimes users might want a different format. However, since the question doesn't mention changing the format, I'll assume keeping MKV is okay. Alternatively, they might want to convert to MP4, but the question doesn't say. So I'll stick with the same container.\n\nPutting it all together: the command would be ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 output.mkv. Wait, but the user might want to keep the original video stream, which is the first one. So the command would map the video (0:v:0) and the third audio (0:a:2). \n\nWait, maybe the user has multiple audio tracks, and they want to keep the original video but only the third audio. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 output.mkv\n\nBut I should check if the user wants to keep the original video stream, which is the first one. So that's correct. \n\nAlso, the user might not want any other streams. So the command would select only the video stream and the third audio stream. \n\nBut what if the input has other audio streams? The command would ignore them because we're only mapping the third audio. \n\nI should also mention that the user might need to adjust the stream indices if there are multiple video streams, but since they said \"original video,\" assuming there's only one video stream. \n\nSo the final command would be as above. Also, the output file name can be specified, maybe output.mkv. \n\nI should explain that -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream, and -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream. Also, note the container format. The user didn't specify, so using the same as input is safe. If they wanted a different format, they'd have to specify, but the question doesn't mention that.\n</think>\n\nTo extract the third audio stream while retaining the original video from `movie.mkv`, use `-map` to explicitly select the desired streams. The input file likely contains multiple audio tracks (e.g., different languages or commentaries), and this command isolates the third audio track (0:a:2) and the first video track (0:v:0). \n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream (assuming only one video stream exists).\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (0-based indexing).\n- The output format defaults to the same container (MKV) as the input unless changed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 output.mkv\n``` \n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input has at least three audio streams.  \n- Only one video stream exists (if multiple videos are present, adjust `0:v:0` accordingly).  \n- No additional streams (e.g., subtitles) are desired.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for the user's request to keep the original video while mapping the third audio stream. It logically maps the necessary streams and does not contain any syntactical or functional errors.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 output.mkv`) is valid and does not miss any required options or use any incorrect parameters.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies the input and output files, along with the necessary mapping options. The syntax aligns with the conventions set forth in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described. It successfully meets the userâ€™s requirements without errors or invalid commands. Therefore, it should be rated as a passing output."
