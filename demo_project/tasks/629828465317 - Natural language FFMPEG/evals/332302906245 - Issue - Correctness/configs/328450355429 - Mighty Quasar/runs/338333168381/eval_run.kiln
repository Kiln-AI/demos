    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately maps the specified video stream (6) and audio stream (9) to create the output file `output.mp4`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example. The command does not include any invalid options or incorrect parameters. The syntax is proper, and it uses valid mappings consistent with FFmpeg functionality.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, the command does not break any requirements. The options used (e.g., `-map`) are in alignment with the documentation regarding stream mapping, and the command syntax adheres to the guidelines provided.\n\n4) Given the above evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described and correctly fulfills the userâ€™s request without any errors. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation."
