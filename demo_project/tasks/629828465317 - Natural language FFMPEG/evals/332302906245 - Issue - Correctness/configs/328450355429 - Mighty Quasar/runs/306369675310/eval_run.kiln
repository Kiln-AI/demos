  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as FLAC, you can simply map the audio stream and specify FLAC as the output codec. For noise reduction, `ffmpeg` offers the `afftdn` filter (adaptive filter for denoising using FFT). \n\nSince you want to use the experimental codec and FLAC is commonly considered stable, I assume you want to enable `-strict experimental` for any features flagged experimental in your build.\n\nThe command will extract the audio, apply noise reduction using `afftdn`, and save as FLAC.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video.mp4`: Input file.\n- `-af afftdn`: Applies frequency domain noise reduction filter.\n- `-c:a flac`: Sets audio codec to FLAC.\n- `-strict experimental`: Allows experimental features if needed.\n- `output.flac`: Output filename.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated seems appropriate for extracting audio and converting it to FLAC format while applying noise reduction. All parameters specified are valid and used correctly according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not include any non-existent options, like the `extra_fast` preset mentioned in the failure example.\n\n3) The command conforms to the requirements dictated in the provided man page for `ffmpeg`. The options are applied in an appropriate order, the input file and codec specifications are correctly set, and no invalid parameters are present.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It effectively generated a valid command without errors or misuse of options. Thus, it can be concluded that the model performed correctly in this instance."
