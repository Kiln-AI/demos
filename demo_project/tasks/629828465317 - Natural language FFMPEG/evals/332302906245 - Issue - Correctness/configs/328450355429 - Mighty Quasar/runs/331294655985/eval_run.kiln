  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract the fifth audio track from `input.mov` and combine it with the video stream from the same file, use the `-map` option to explicitly select the desired streams. Assuming the video is the first stream (index 0) and the fifth audio track is index 4 (0-based), this command maps the video and the fifth audio track while preserving their original codecs (for efficiency). If the audio codec isn't compatible with the output container, you may need to re-encode it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:4 output.mov\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n1. The video stream is the first one in `input.mov` (index 0).\n2. The fifth audio track is at index 4 (0-based) in the file.\n3. You want to preserve the original codecs (no re-encoding). If this isn't the case, specify codecs like `-c:v h264` or `-c:a aac` as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model’s output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated directly addresses the user’s request to extract audio track 5 from the video file and combine it with the video stream, using the correct `-map` option to specify the desired streams. The command effectively meets the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the failure example provided. There are no incorrect or nonexistent options in the generated command. The command effectively utilizes the `-map` options to select the desired streams and does not include any invalid presets or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the `-map` option for stream selection, adheres to the correct syntax for input and output files, and does not contain any logically incorrect or unsupported parameters.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct, appropriately formed, and matches the user's requirements. It does not contain any issues regarding incorrect command construction, indicating a successful completion of the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
