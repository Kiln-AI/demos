  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from an input file to an output file, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg. The -map 0:3 tells ffmpeg to include stream index 3 from the first input (source.mkv), and -map 0:5 includes stream index 5. \n\nWhen converting to MP4, ensure the codecs are compatible (usually H.264 for video and AAC or MP3 for audio). If the streams arenâ€™t compatible, ffmpeg may re-encode them accordingly. \n\nThe command below explicitly maps video and audio streams as specified (assuming stream 0:3 is video and stream 0:5 is audio), and outputs to edited.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset medium -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```\n\nParameters explained:\n\n- -map 0:3 and -map 0:5 select the specific streams from input.\n- -c:v libx264 encodes video in H.264 suitable for MP4.\n- -c:a aac ensures audio is AAC, compatible with MP4.\n- -preset medium balances encoding speed and quality.\n- -b:a 192k sets audio bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart makes the MP4 file more web-friendly (metadata at the start).\n\nIf the input streams are already in the correct format, you can omit re-encoding by setting codec copies e.g. -c:v copy -c:a copy, but this depends on the stream codecs compatibility with MP4.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model correctly maps specific video and audio streams from the input file and outputs to the desired output file format (edited.mp4). The use of appropriate codecs for conversion aligns with the typical requirements for MP4 files. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not contain any incorrect options or spelling errors that would render it invalid (e.g., there is no use of a non-existent preset like `extra_fast`). The options used are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly follows the syntax for stream mapping and encoding, and all specified options are consistent with the ffmpeg documentation. The use of `-map`, codec specifications, and additional parameters such as `-preset`, `-b:a`, and `-movflags` are all appropriate.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the described issue, and it meets all requirements according to the ffmpeg man page, it should pass. The output is a valid and correctly formed ffmpeg command based on the user's request."
