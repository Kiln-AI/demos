  "output": "To extract the audio track from a video file and generate both a 320 kbps MP3 and a lossless WAV in a single command, we can use two separate `-map 0:a` directives (to include only the audio stream) followed by individual output file specifications.\n\n- `-map 0:a:0` (or shorthand `-map 0:a`) tells ffmpeg to use the first audio stream of `input.mp4`.\n- `-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k` encodes that stream as 320 kb/s CBR MP3.\n- `-c:a pcm_s16le` keeps the second output uncompressed (signed-16-bit little-endian WAV, any container that ends in `.wav` becomes WAV by default).\n\n<your_video>\nReplace `input.mp4` with the actual source filename and, if necessary, change the extension to `.mkv`, `.mov`, etc.\n</your_video>\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -map 0:a -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k audio_320kbps.mp3 \\\n  -map 0:a -c:a pcm_s16le audio_lossless.wav\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described. The command generated accurately performs the task of extracting audio from a video file and saving it in two formats (MP3 and WAV) with the specified parameters. The command is properly structured to use the `-map` directive and the correct codecs.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The command produced is complete, containing the necessary parameters and codec options, making it a valid command that should execute without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It adheres to the correct syntax, uses appropriate options, and the specified codecs are valid. Each component of the command follows the format rules outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the command is valid and does not produce errors, it should pass the evaluation. The model successfully generated a command that meets the user's requirements without any issues."
