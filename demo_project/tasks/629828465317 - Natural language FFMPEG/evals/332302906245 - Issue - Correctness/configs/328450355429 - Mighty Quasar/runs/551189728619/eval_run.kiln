  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map the third audio stream from your input MKV file while keeping the original video intact, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg to select specific streams. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from input (assuming only one video stream is present).\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (since audio streams are zero-indexed).\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the selected audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- There is only one video stream in the input.\n- The third audio stream is present and in the expected format.\n- The output container is compatible (MKV in this example since it supports multiple audio streams).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output generates a valid `ffmpeg` command which accurately meets the user's requirements. It correctly maps the original video stream and the third audio stream without altering them, using the appropriate options for stream copying. Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and can be considered correct.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output does not resemble the failing output example as it does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters. The command and parameters used are valid and meet the requirements of the task.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command follows the syntax and requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. It uses `-map` to specify which streams to include in the output and employs `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to indicate that streams should be copied without encoding. There are no violations of any command structure or syntax as dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command is valid, correct in execution, and fulfills the userâ€™s request, thus passing the evaluation."
