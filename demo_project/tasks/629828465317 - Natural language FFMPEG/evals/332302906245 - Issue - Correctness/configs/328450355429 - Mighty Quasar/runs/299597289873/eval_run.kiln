  "input": "I need to convert input.mov to MP4 using the libx265 codec with CRF 18 for high quality",
  "output": "You want to convert `input.mov` to an MP4 file using the libx265 codec for high quality, specified by a CRF of 18. This will result in a visually lossless or very near-lossless video.\n\n- `libx265` is a modern, efficient video codec that provides excellent compression and quality.\n- `crf 18` sets the Constant Rate Factor. Lower CRF values result in higher quality and larger file sizes. CRF 18 is a good starting point for high-quality encoding.\n- We'll use the `c:a copy` option to directly copy the audio stream from the input to the output, avoiding re-encoding and preserving the original audio quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4`) is correct and satisfies the user's request for converting `input.mov` to MP4 with the specified codec and quality settings.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failing output example provided (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and contains valid parameters/settings.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, the video codec (`libx265`), the constant rate factor (`-crf 18`), and maintains the audio stream without re-encoding (`-c:a copy`). All parameters are valid according to the man page.\n\n4) Since the command is correct and does not contain any issues, it passes the evaluation. The model has successfully generated a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements."
