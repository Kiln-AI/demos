  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "You want to extract audio track 5 and combine it with the video stream from the same file, keeping only those streams in the output.\n\nHereâ€™s how to do that:\n\n- Use `-map` to explicitly select streams:\n  - `0:v:0` for the first video stream from input.mov\n  - `0:a:4` for the fifth audio stream (0-based index, so 4 is the 5th)\n- Use `-c copy` to stream copy both audio and video without re-encoding, preserving quality and saving time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:4 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nAssumption: The input video has at least 1 video stream and 5 or more audio tracks, with the fifth audio track indexed as `0:a:4`. This command does no re-encoding, so formats are preserved.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated seems to accurately reflect the user's request to extract the fifth audio track and combine it with the video track from the same file, mapping the streams appropriately.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command does not include any errors like non-existent parameters, and it follows the appropriate syntax for ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (`-map` for stream selection and `-c copy` for copying the streams) are consistent with standard usage.\n\n4) The model's output is correct and effectively addresses the user's request, and it adheres to the guidelines specified in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
