  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert your MOV file with alpha channel to WebM while preserving transparency, you'll need to use VP9 codec which supports alpha channels, along with Opus audio codec for WebM compatibility.\n\nVP9 can encode alpha channels when using the yuva420p pixel format. The `-auto-alt-ref 0` flag disables alternative reference frames which can cause issues with alpha channel encoding. I'm using CRF 30 as a starting point for quality (lower values = higher quality), and Opus codec for audio since it's the preferred audio codec for WebM.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -crf 30 -c:a libopus output.webm\n```\n\nKey parameters:\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Uses VP9 video codec\n- `-pix_fmt yuva420p`: Pixel format that includes alpha channel (the 'a' stands for alpha)\n- `-auto-alt-ref 0`: Disables alt-ref frames which can interfere with alpha encoding\n- `-crf 30`: Quality setting (adjust between 15-35 as needed)\n- `-c:a libopus`: Uses Opus audio codec for WebM",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated correctly converts a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM file while preserving transparency using the VP9 codec, which supports alpha channels. The command is logically structured, and the parameters used are appropriate for the desired output.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The provided command is valid and uses correct parameters. The model clearly specifies the codec, pixel format, and other options without introducing any invalid settings like the non-existent preset in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The parameters used (such as `-c:v libvpx-vp9`, `-pix_fmt yuva420p`, `-auto-alt-ref 0`, and `-c:a libopus`) are all valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. The command structure adheres to the general rules about option application and order, ensuring proper execution without conflicts.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct. It conveys the accurate ffmpeg command to achieve the user's request, remaining aligned with expectations for both syntax and functionality."
