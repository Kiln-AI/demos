  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "For best results when applying temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement, the recommended order is:\n\n1. **Temporal noise reduction** — reduces noise between frames.\n2. **Spatial denoising** — smooths remaining noise within each frame.\n3. **Edge enhancement** — sharpens edges after noise reduction to avoid amplifying noise.\n\n**Common filters for each:**\n- Temporal denoising: `tblend` (frame blending) or `minterpolate`, but most often `hqdn3d` (which does both spatial and temporal), or for explicit temporal: `tblend`, or `mp=temporal=3` from `mpdecimate`.\n- Spatial denoising: `hqdn3d`, `nlmeans`, or `atadenoise`.\n- Edge enhancement: `unsharp` or `edges`.\n\nHere, `hqdn3d` is commonly used for combined temporal + spatial denoising, but for full control and explicit separate steps, you might use `tmix` or `tblend` for temporal, `nlmeans` for spatial, and `unsharp` for edge enhancement.\n\n**Example chain:**  \n- Use `tblend=all_mode=average` for temporal smoothing.\n- `nlmeans=...` for spatial denoising.\n- `unsharp` for edge enhancement.\n\nAssuming you're using `nlmeans` for spatial and `unsharp` for edges:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tblend=all_mode=average,setpts=PTS/1.0,nlmeans=filter_size=7:search_size=21:pcut=0.01:rcut=0.01:pw=1:rw=2,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of each filter and parameters:**\n- `tblend=all_mode=average` averages neighboring frames for temporal noise reduction.\n- `setpts=PTS/1.0` corrects timestamps after temporal blending.\n- `nlmeans` is a powerful spatial denoiser.\n- `unsharp` sharpens edges; `luma_msize_x/y` controls matrix size, `amount` controls strength.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Input is video (`mp4`).\n- You want strong denoising and moderate sharpening.\n- You have `nlmeans` enabled in your FFmpeg build (common in recent versions).\n\nAdjust parameters to taste for your input.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue as per the description. Although the concepts of temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement were correctly identified, the actual filter chain syntax and parameters used are potentially problematic. The `nlmeans` filter parameters may not be valid for all FFmpeg builds, depending on compilation and library support. This could lead to the command failing when executed.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is more complex and uses valid filters according to the explanation. However, there could still be parameters within those filters that are unsupported or misconfigured.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any high-level requirements dictated in the man page. The structure is valid, and it adheres to the general command line syntax for `ffmpeg`. However, the application of specific filters may cause issues stemming from parameters that depend on the FFmpeg build.\n\n4) Given that the output does have issues that could potentially lead to errors when executing, it should fail based on the requirement for the command to work correctly. Thus, the model's performance in this instance contains inaccuracies and leads to a likely failure in executing the provided command correctly."
