  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add subtitles to their video but also remove all existing subtitle tracks. Let me think about how to approach this with ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, to remove existing subtitle streams, I need to copy all video and audio streams and discard the subtitle ones. Using the -map option to specify which streams to include. So, maybe -map 0:v -map 0:a to map all video and audio streams from the input, which effectively excludes subtitles.\n\nThen, adding the new subtitles. Using the -i option to input the subtitle file (assuming it's an SRT file, but the user didn't specify, so maybe I should note that). Then, using -c copy for the video and audio to avoid re-encoding, which is efficient. But for the subtitle, I need to copy the subtitle codec.\n\nWait, but when you add a new subtitle, you need to specify the -c:s copy for the subtitle stream. Also, the output file should have both the new subtitle and no existing ones. \n\nWait, but if I'm mapping only video and audio, then adding the new subtitle as a separate input. So the command would include the original video and audio streams, and then add the new subtitle.\n\nSo putting it all together: input the main video, input the subtitle file. Then map all video and audio streams from the first input, and the subtitle stream from the second input. Then copy all streams. That way, existing subtitles in the original are excluded, and the new one is added.\n\nSo the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitle.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nWait, but the subtitle codec might need to be mov_text for MP4 containers, which is different from SRT. So converting the SRT to mov_text. But if the subtitle is SRT, ffmpeg can burn it in or multiplex it as a subtitle stream. However, MP4 supports subtitles in some formats but not all. For example, mov_text is supported, but SRT might need to be converted. Alternatively, using -c:s mov_text would transcode the subtitle.\n\nWait, but if the user wants to add a subtitle as a separate track (like hard in the file), using -map 1 would map the subtitle input. But if the subtitle is a soft subtitle (embedded as a track), the container must support it. MP4 can handle mov_text-based subtitles.\n\nAlternatively, if the user wants to burn the subtitles into the video, that's a different approach using filters. But the user didn't specify, so maybe they want a soft subtitle track.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Map all video and audio streams from the original.\n\n2. Map the subtitle stream from the new SRT file.\n\n3. Copy all streams (video, audio, and the new subtitle), which will exclude existing subtitles.\n\nSo the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitle.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nBut wait, -c copy -c:s mov_text might conflict. Because -c copy copies all streams without re-encoding, but for the subtitle, we need to re-encode it to mov_text. So maybe:\n\nUse -c copy for video and audio, and for the subtitle, specify -c:s mov_text. But how to target only the subtitle stream?\n\nPerhaps:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitle.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nThis way, video and audio are copied, and the new subtitle is encoded as mov_text. Existing subtitles are not mapped, so they are excluded.\n\nBut need to confirm that the mapping is correct.\n\nYes. The first -map 0:v takes all video from input 0, -map 0:a all audio, and -map 1 takes all streams (assuming that the second input is only the subtitle, so only one subtitle stream). Then, the codecs for video and audio are copy, and the subtitle is encoded as mov_text. This should remove existing subtitles and add the new one.\n\nBut if the input subtitle is SRT, the -c:s mov_text will convert it to that format, which is compatible with MP4. However, some players may have limited support for soft subtitles in MP4, but it's a common method.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The subtitle file is in subtitle.srt, and the user wants to add that as a new subtitle track.\n\n- The output container can handle the new subtitle.\n\nAnother approach is to copy everything except the subtitle streams, then add the new subtitle. The -map option allows to select only the streams we want.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using -map 0 -map 1 to copy all streams from input 0 (video, audio, subtitles) and then map input 1's subtitle, but that would include existing subtitles. So to exclude them, -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the command would be correct as above.\n\nTherefore, the final command:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitle.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nThis removes existing subtitles (since they are not mapped) and adds the new subtitle as mov_text in the MP4.\n\nBut the user needs to replace input.mp4 and subtitle.srt with their actual filenames. Also, the output will have the new subtitle track and no others.\n\nAnother thing to note: If the user wants to burn the subtitles into the video (hard subtitles), that would require using the subtitles filter. But the user said \"add subtitles\" and \"remove all existing subtitle tracks\". It's more likely they want a soft subtitle track.\n\nSo I think the correct approach is to map video, audio, and new subtitle, copy video and audio, and encode the new subtitle.\n\nTherefore, the command should be as above. Need to make sure that the subtitle is the second input and mapped as the third stream.\n\nAlso, the user should replace the input and output filenames. So the example command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nBut in this case, -c copy for video and audio, and -c:s mov_text for the subtitle. Because if you do -c copy -c:s mov_text, it will copy all streams (video, audio) and encode the subtitle as mov_text. So the video and audio are copied, and the new subtitle is encoded.\n\nYes, that should work.\n\nAnother thing to check: if the original video has multiple subtitles, the -map 0:v and 0:a will exclude them. So the output will have only the new subtitle as a single subtitle track.\n\nSo the final explanation would be to explain the mapping, the copying of streams, encoding the subtitle to mov_text for compatibility, and the output.\n</think>\n\nTo add new subtitles while removing existing ones, first specify only the video and audio streams from the input (excluding original subtitles), then add the new subtitle stream. Map video (0:v) and audio (0:a) from the first input, and map the second input's streams (assumed to be the subtitle) as stream 1. Copy video/audio without re-encoding (lossless, fast), and encode the new subtitle to MP4-compatible mov_text. This approach removes existing subtitles and embeds the new one as a soft subtitle track.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt \\\n  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 \\\n  -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text \\\n  -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng \\\n  output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- `subtitles.srt` is your subtitle file.\n- You want to embed the new subtitle as a soft (selectable) track.\n- Output container is MP4, which requires -c:s mov_text.\n- New subtitle language is English (change `language=eng` if needed).\n- Removes all existing subtitle tracks by not mapping them.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly maps video and audio streams from the input file, excludes existing subtitle tracks, and adds a new subtitle stream encoded in the correct format. There are no apparent mistakes in the command itself that would render it non-functional or not in line with the user's request.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated by the model is well-structured and does not contain any blatant errors such as using invalid options or parameters. It specifies the commands and codec types appropriately, in line with the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n3) Analyzing the command against the man page for ffmpeg: \n- The command uses the appropriate options for mapping streams (`-map`), copying existing video and audio streams without re-encoding (`-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`), and specifying the subtitle codec (`-c:s mov_text`). \n- It adheres to the order of options as stated in the man page, specifically applying options relevant to each input/output file correctly. \n- It does not break any requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) The output does not contain the issue described, as it functions correctly while adhering to the ffmpeg command requirements. Therefore, the model's output should pass according to the criteria provided."
