  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To convert input.avi into a high-bitrate MP4 suitable for streaming, you'll use a very high video bitrate of 100,000 kbps and an audio bitrate of 512 kbps.\n\n- `-b:v` sets the video bitrate; in this case, it's set to 100,000 kbps.\n- `-b:a` sets the audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n\nAssuming you want to maintain an HD resolution of 1080p:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -b:v 100000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nPlease note that such a high bitrate might lead to extremely large file sizes. Ensure that your target environment (hard drive space, network bandwidth, streaming capacity) can support such high-bitrate files.\n\nAlso, note that a higher bitrate doesn't always translate to better quality, especially if the source material isn't of high quality to begin with. Crf (quality) and resolution play a much bigger role in determining video quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described regarding generating an incorrect `ffmpeg` command. The output correctly specifies the command and its parameters to fulfill the user's requirement of setting a very high bitrate for both video (100,000 kbps) and audio (512 kbps). \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?** \nThe output is not similar to the failing example since there is no incorrect or non-existent preset being used, nor is there an obvious error in the syntax that would cause the command to fail. The command seems to follow the proper structure of `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page. The options used (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-vf`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, `-pix_fmt`, `-movflags`) are all valid and properly placed for the output file format being generated. The only consideration is that very high bitrates may produce large files, but that does not render the command invalid.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
