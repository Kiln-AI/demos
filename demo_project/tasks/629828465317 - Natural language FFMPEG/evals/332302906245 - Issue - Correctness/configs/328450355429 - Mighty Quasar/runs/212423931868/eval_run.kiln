  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate your video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction, we will use the `transpose` filter for rotation and the `hqdn3d` filter for noise reduction. \n\n- `transpose=1` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `hqdn3d` is a 3D High Quality Denoise filter, which works well for reducing noise while preserving details. Customizable parameters can be adjusted for \"strength\" (level and spatial_strong), but a default strong configuration gives a good starting point.\n- These filters are applied using the `-vf` (video filter) option.\n- We assume that your video has standard encoding and you want to maintain the original resolution after rotation (which swaps it unless specified otherwise).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=5:5:4:4\" -c:a copy output_rotated_denosed.mp4\n```\n\nThis command rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise and applies a strong HQ noise reduction (`hqdn3d`) filter. You can increase the values of `hqdn3d` for even more aggressive noise reduction, e.g., `hqdn3d=50:50:40:40` (values typically range 0â€“100). For more complex noise reduction, consider using filters like `noise=type=nr:all=10` in combination.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command produced by the model correctly applies the rotation and noise reduction as requested by the user, adhering to their requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is valid and does not include any nonexistent presets or parameters.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax is correct, the filters used are valid, and the parameters conform to the expected usage.\n\n4) Given the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should be considered a successful execution of the task."
