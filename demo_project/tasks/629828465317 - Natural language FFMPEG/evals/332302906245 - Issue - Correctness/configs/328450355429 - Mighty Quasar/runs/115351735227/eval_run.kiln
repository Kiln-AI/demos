    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output successfully meets the user's requirements by generating a correct `ffmpeg` command that maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file into the output file. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command produced is correctly formatted and utilizes valid parameters, specifically `-map` options to select the correct streams and `-c:v copy -c:a copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The usage of `-map` is appropriate for selecting specific audio and video streams from the input file. The `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options correctly indicate that the streams should be copied as-is, which is valid according to the documentation.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus passes evaluation. The command fulfills the user's request without errors."
