  "output": "To extract a specific video and audio stream from a file with multiple tracks, you need to use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. Here, you want to select video stream 15 and audio stream 22.\n\n- `-map 0:15` maps the 16th video stream (15 is the 16th index starting from 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:22` maps the 23rd audio stream (22 is the 23rd index starting from 0) from the input file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will extract the specified streams and merge them into a single output file. Assumes that the indexes provided (15 for video and 22 for audio) are correct and available in the `source.mkv` file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nNo, the model's output does not contain any issues. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams. The output command is syntactically correct, and the parameters used are appropriate for the task requested by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly references existing streams using `-map`, and it does not contain any invalid options like `extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements outlined in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The `-map` options used in the command are correctly structured, and the mapping is done according to the streams specified. The command does not conflict with any other requirements or options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation. It successfully produces a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the requirements stated by the user, so it should pass."
