    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated correctly addresses the user's requirement to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from `input.mov` to create an output file. The command uses valid `-map` parameters and employs `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is an appropriate approach when no alteration to the quality or format is necessary.\n\n2) The modelâ€™s output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and should execute correctly because it uses recognized options and proper syntax. Unlike the failing output example that uses a nonexistent option, the produced command uses valid arguments.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly applies the mapping options for specifying which input streams should be copied to the output and adheres to the requirement for defining input and output files properly. The usage of `-c copy` for both audio and video streams is appropriate for a command that simply transfers streams without needing re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as it meets the user's requirements correctly and uses valid `ffmpeg` command structure. The output command is accurately tailored to the task presented."
