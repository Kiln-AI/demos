  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility and universal codec support on all devices, the safest choice is to encode the video to H.264 (AVC) with AAC audio inside an MP4 container. This combination is supported almost everywhere. Use a standard pixel format (yuv420p) for compatibility, and add the faststart flag to enable progressive streaming.\n\nIf you want to keep the original resolution and frame rate, the command below will do that using reasonable quality settings.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_compatible.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264`: encodes video with H.264.\n- `-preset medium`: balances encoding speed and compression.\n- `-crf 23`: quality level for H.264 (lower means better quality).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: AAC audio at 128 kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: ensures color format compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: moves metadata to the start for streaming.\n\nAssumption: Your input is named `input.mp4`. Change the input filename accordingly. This command creates a new file without modifying the original.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain any syntactical issues or errors in the ffmpeg command it generated. The parameters used are valid and correspond to the requirements for maximum compatibility and universal codec support. Therefore, we conclude it does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The generated command uses valid options and parameters as per the ffmpeg documentation, while the example features a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`). Thus, the output is valid and not failing.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Analyzing the command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_compatible.mp4`), it adheres to the syntax and requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options is respected, and all parameters align with the expected usage without any conflicts. There are no violations of the mandatories described in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - **No**, the output does not contain the issue described. It generated a valid, working ffmpeg command that aligns well with expected parameters for achieving universal compatibility in media files. It fulfills the task requirements without any faults."
