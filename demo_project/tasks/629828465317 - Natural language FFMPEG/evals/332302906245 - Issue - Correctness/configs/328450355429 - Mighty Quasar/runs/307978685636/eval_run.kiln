  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To achieve this, you need to specify the audio stream indices for both the input and output files. The input file is a Matroska file, which natively supports multiple audio streams. Here, we'll assume the third audio stream is selected. For a Matroska file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. `-map 3` tells `ffmpeg` to select the third audio stream from the input.\n2. `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` mean copying the video and audio streams (without re-encoding) to the output file, respectively. Since we're selecting just one audio stream (`-map 3`), output video stream configuration remains the same.\n3. `OUTPUT_FILE` is where the `output.mp4` part belongs.\n4. This command assumes the original video track and the selected audio track are consecutive in the Matroska container. If they are not, use `-map 0:k=3` (input, keep track `k=3`) or `-map 3` followed by `-map 0:v` for specific video selection if needed.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n- Your Matroska file supports selecting tracks (`-map` option).\n- A single third audio stream exists (`k=3`).\n\nRemember that the `ffmpeg` command assumes a perfect Matroska setup. If your file might not behave in a perfectly predictable manner in some edge cases, consider `matroskaprobe` for diagnosing playback streams or other video tools.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as it incorrectly references the audio stream with the index `3`. In FFmpeg, stream indices start at `0`. Therefore, the third audio stream should be mapped using `-map 2` instead of `-map 3`. This is a significant mistake that would cause the command to fail to function as intended.\n\n2) Yes, the output is similar to the failure example. The command would fail because the index `3` refers to the non-existent fourth audio stream (assuming there are only three streams) or would not produce the desired mapping that the user requested.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirements dictated in the man page because it improperly indexes the audio stream. According to FFmpeg's stream indexing rules, audio stream 3 should be referenced as `-map 2`. The incorrect stream mapping (`-map 3`) violates the syntax and logic underlying FFmpeg's stream selection.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output indeed contains the issue described. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements and would need correction to be valid."
