  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "Setting both the audio and video bitrate to such high values is not practical, as you'd exceed file system limits and also run into bandwidth and CPU usage constraints. With typical storage, identifying a max bitrate of roughly 1,000 Mbps (or 1 Gbps) would be the limit for individual disks, especially with sysctl limits under Linux, which would cap around 650-675 Mbps for any one file transfer. For the sake of understanding how to set such high bitrates with `ffmpeg`, here's the command, keeping in mind practical usage would need adjustment:\n\n- Setting a 100 Gbps video bitrate is realistic for short-duration, high-quality output.\n- Audio at 500 kbps would be considered overkill but can be set since the large video bitrate will overshadow audio quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx265 -b:v 100000000 -c:a aac -b:a 500k output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx265` tells `ffmpeg` to use the H.265 (HEVC) video codec, which is more compression-efficient and can handle higher bitrates better.\n- `-b:v 100000000` sets the video bitrate to 100 Gbps (100 billion bits per second).\n- `-c:a aac` sets the audio codec to AAC, which is a well-supported and widely-used audio codec.\n- `-b:a 500k` sets the audio bitrate to 500 kbps (kilobits per second).\n\nPlease note: Check the output file size (`__output-file-size=`) to ensure it stays within your desired attainment and system constraints.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue. Specifically, the command attempts to set a video bitrate of 100 Gbps (100 billion bits per second), which is far higher than any practical storage or streaming capability. Typical storage systems cannot accommodate such high bitrates due to hardware and software limitations, and this high bitrate would also lead to massive file sizes that are impractical for usage or distribution.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nIt is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example refers to an incorrect preset value, while this case involves impractically high bitrate values that are likely to result in failures or unusable files, but the command itself is syntactically valid.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nWhile the command itself doesn't break any syntactic rules as per the ffmpeg man page, it does raise practical issues regarding the values used. The bitrate parameters as defined (100,000,000 bits for video and 500,000 bits for audio) are not reasonable to implement in any realistic encoding scenario. Moreover, no guidelines within the man page condone such extreme bitrate settings given normal user situations, which are implicitly expected to stay within the limits of typical hardware.\n\n**Final Evaluation**: The model's output does contain the issue described as it suggests an impractical bitrate command. Thus, it fails to generate a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements."
