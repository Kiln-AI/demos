  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you can utilize the powerful audio-only encoding capabilities of `ffmpeg`.\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input video file.\n- `-vn` disables video recording in the output (audio only).\n- `-c:a flac` encodes the audio using the FLAC codec, which is lossless.\n- `-compression_level 12` sets the maximum compression level for FLAC (FLAC supports compression levels from 0 to 12, where 12 is the highest, but note this may be omitted or vary depending on the encoder version).\n\nHere's the command to perform this task:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n``` \n\nThis command assumes:\n1. Your system has a FLAC encoder supporting compression level 12 (usually via `libflac`).\n2. You want only the audio extracted with the highest possible quality and smallest file size (maximum compression).\n3. The input file is named `video.mp4` and the output will be saved as `output.flac`. Adjust file names as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is syntactically correct and adheres to the requirements from the user, which is to extract audio from a video file `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum compression preset.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command does not include any parameters or values that are invalid or non-existent, such as a non-existing preset like `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It utilizes valid options for extracting audio from a video file and specifies the FLAC codec appropriately. The use of `-compression_level 12` is correct given that it indicates maximum compression; this parameter is standard for FLAC encoding.\n\nOverall assessment: The model's output is correct and meets the userâ€™s requirements without any issues. The command works correctly as specified, thus it **passes** the evaluation."
