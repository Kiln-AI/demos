  "output": "To map only the 2nd video stream and 4th audio stream into a new file you use the -map option with the stream‐index notation “fileIndex:streamType:streamIndex” (0-based).  \n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the 2nd video stream (the first is v:0).  \n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the 4th audio stream (the first three are a:0, a:1, a:2).  \nThe output keeps whatever codecs are already in `complex.avi`; add further options (for example `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`) only if you need re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is correct for the user's request to map the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the source file `complex.avi`. All necessary parameters are included, and the explanation reflects an accurate understanding of the stream mapping process in FFmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model is correct and functional, while the failure example features an invalid command. Therefore, the model's command should work correctly when run.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The command is properly structured using the `-map` options, and the use of `-c copy` is appropriate since it specifies that the codec will be copied directly without re-encoding. The mapping syntax used conforms to the documented usage.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output should pass because it does not contain any issues regarding correctness in the command-generated or outputs. The command meets the user's requirements, is functional, and aligns with the FFmpeg documentation."
