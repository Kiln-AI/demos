  "output": "To remove audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream:\n\n1. Use `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream directly (no re-encoding).\n2. Add `-an` to strip all audio streams explicitly (ffmpeg requires this to discard audio when remuxing).\n3. Ensure the output container format (MP4) is correctly specified.\n\nAssumes the video has only a single audio and video stream. Will preserve the original video encoding and bitrate in output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command provided successfully removes the audio without re-compressing the video stream, adhering to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain any incorrect options or parameters that would lead to failure, unlike the example where a non-existent preset caused a failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-c:v copy` and `-an`) are valid and appropriate for the task of removing audio while copying the video stream without re-encoding.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command is correct and suitable for the user's request, leading to a **pass** for this evaluation."
