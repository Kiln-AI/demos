  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams in a multi-track file, use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. Stream indexing starts at 0, so \"video stream 6\" means the seventh video stream (`0:v:6`) and \"audio stream 9\" means the tenth audio stream (`0:a:9`). If your input has only one file, it's referenced as input 0.\n\nThis command copies the selected streams without re-encoding (using `-c copy`), preserving original quality. If you want to re-encode, change or remove `-c copy`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your input file is `input.ext` (replace with actual filename/extension).\n- The selected streams exist (stream numbers are zero-based).\n- `output.mp4` will be compatible with the selected codecs. If not, re-encode using `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` instead of `-c copy`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command seems to correctly reflect the user's request of mapping specific video and audio streams from a multi-track file.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command it generated is syntactically correct and will execute properly if the specified streams exist in the input file.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - No, the command complies with the requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses `-map` for selecting specific streams, and `-c copy` which is allowed for copying codec data without re-encoding.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue. Since the command is appropriate and all specified elements conform to the usage of ffmpeg, **the model's output should pass this evaluation.**"
