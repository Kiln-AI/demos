  "input": "I want to convert video.webm to MP4 using the h264 codec with the lightning preset",
  "output": "You want to convert `video.webm` to `video.mp4` using the H.264 codec with the \"lightning\" preset. The \"lightning\" preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency.\n\n- `libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset lightning` sets the encoding speed preset to \"lightning\".\n-  The conversion will automatically handle audio, using a default audio codec and settings.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset lightning -c:a copy video.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is a valid ffmpeg command that will work as intended based on the user's request to convert a `.webm` file to an MP4 file using the H.264 codec with the \"lightning\" preset. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output is not similar to the failing output example. The command does not use a non-existent preset such as `extra_fast`. Instead, it correctly uses the `lightning` preset, which is legitimate.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command follows the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, uses the `-c:v` option to set the video codec to `libx264`, and uses the `-preset lightning` which is a supported preset for H.264 encoding. The handling of the audio codec with `-c:a copy` also adheres to the syntax rules, meaning it will copy the audio stream from the input to the output.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain the issue as it correctly follows the format and requirements for generating an effective ffmpeg command. Thus, it passes."
