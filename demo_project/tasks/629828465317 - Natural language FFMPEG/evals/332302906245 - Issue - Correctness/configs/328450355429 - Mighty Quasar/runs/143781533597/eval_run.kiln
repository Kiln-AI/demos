  "input": "I want to apply a complex video filter chain to add a watermark and adjust brightness. Use -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' to resize, add watermark, and brighten the video.",
  "output": "To apply the specified video filter chain, use the `-vf` option in `ffmpeg`. This command will resize the video to 1280x720, overlay `watermark.png` at position (10, 10), and adjust the brightness by adding 0.2. I am going to assume that the input file is input.mp4 and the output file is output.mp4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly implements the user's request to apply a complex video filter chain that includes resizing, adding a watermark, and adjusting brightness. The structure of the command appears to be valid given the specified filters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is well-formed and does not contain any obvious mistakes such as the use of non-existing preset options or incorrectly structured commands. The use of options and filters is appropriate for the intended operations.\n\n3) The produced ffmpeg command does not break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-vf` option is applied correctly in conjunction with the input and output files. Each filter is properly separated with a comma, and the overlay command correctly specifies the position for the watermark image. The overall command aligns with valid usage as per the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and it passes the evaluation criteria. Therefore, the model's performance on this task can be deemed satisfactory."
