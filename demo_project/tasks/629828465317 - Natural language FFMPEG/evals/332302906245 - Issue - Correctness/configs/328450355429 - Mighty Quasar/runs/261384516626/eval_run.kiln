  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` to MP4 with a locked bitrate of exactly 5000 kb/s using Variable Bit Rate (VBR), youâ€™ll use the `-b:v` flag to specify the target average bitrate. The `libx264` encoder natively supports VBR, and the `-movflags +faststart` option ensures compatibility for web streaming by reorganizing the MP4 file.\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The input `raw_footage.mxf` contains a video stream (e.g., ProRes, H.264, etc.).\n- The user wants the average bitrate set to 5000 kb/s, with VBR behavior (bitrate may vary slightly but stays around the target).\n- Audio is encoded using the default AAC codec unless specified otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated matches the user requirements of converting the video from `raw_footage.mxf` to MP4 with a locked bitrate of 5000 kb/s using VBR. It uses the correct parameters and order for setting the video codec and bitrate.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The output provided by the model does not contain any incorrect parameters or syntactic errors like the example that incorrectly lists a non-existent preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used are valid and correctly formatted according to the ffmpeg documentation. The use of `-b:v` to set the video bitrate and `-movflags +faststart` to ensure the file is suitable for streaming are appropriate.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nSince the command is correct and the requirements of the user are fulfilled, the model does not contain any issues in its output. It successfully generates a valid command according to the user's specifications. Therefore, it should pass."
