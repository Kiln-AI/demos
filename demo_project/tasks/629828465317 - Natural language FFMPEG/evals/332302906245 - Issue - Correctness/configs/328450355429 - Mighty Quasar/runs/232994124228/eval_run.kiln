  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "You want to extract specific streams from a multi-stream video file. I will use the `-map` option to select the desired video and audio streams and then combine them into a new file.\n\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (stream index 1) from the input file (index 0).\n- `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (stream index 3) from the input file (index 0).\n- The `-c copy` option copies the selected streams without re-encoding, which is faster and avoids quality loss if the streams are already in a suitable format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The `ffmpeg` command generated by the model correctly addresses the user request to extract the second video stream and the fourth audio track from the input file. It uses the `-map` option appropriately and copies the streams without re-encoding, which aligns with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4`) follows the correct syntax and uses valid options. There are no errors or invalid configurations in the command that would lead to a failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly applies the `-map` options to specify the input streams to extract and uses the `-c copy` option, which is valid for copying streams without loss of quality.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is accurate and meets the task requirements. It generates a functioning `ffmpeg` command that should work correctly to achieve the userâ€™s request. Thus, it passes the evaluation successfully."
