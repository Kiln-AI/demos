  "input": "I need to convert input.mov to AVI format using the libx263 video codec and mp3 audio",
  "output": "To convert `input.mov` to AVI format using the `libx263` video codec (note: this is likely a typo for `libx264`, which is the correct and widely used H.264 encoder) and `mp3` audio, you can use the following command. I assume you meant `libx264` as `libx263` is not a valid codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -c:a mp3 output.avi\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec for encoding.\n- `-c:a mp3` selects the MP3 audio codec.\n- The output format is set to AVI automatically based on the file extension.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. The output command specifies the use of `libx263` as the video codec. However, `libx263` does not existâ€”and it was correctly identified by the model as likely being a typo for `libx264`, which is the proper codec. The command generated by the model is technically incorrect due to the invalid codec.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The command `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails due to the non-existent option of `-preset extra_fast`. In contrast, the model's output does produce an executable command, assuming the codec had been correctly specified as `libx264` instead of the nonexistent `libx263`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page; however, it contains an invalid codec option, which makes it non-functional. Other than the codec issue, the structure and syntax of the command are correct based on the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output should fail, as it contains the issue of using a non-existent video codec `libx263`. The command will not work as intended."
