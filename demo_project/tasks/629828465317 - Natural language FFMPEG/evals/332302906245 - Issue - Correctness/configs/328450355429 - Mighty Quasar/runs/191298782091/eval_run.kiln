  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream file and save them to MP4, use the `-map` parameter to specify which streams to include in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:4` selects video stream 4 from input 0 (broadcast.mkv)\n- `-map 0:9` selects audio stream 9 from input 0 (broadcast.mkv)\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest, maintains original quality)\n- If the original codecs aren't MP4-compatible, ffmpeg will automatically re-encode\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- You want to keep the original quality/encoding of the selected streams\n- The selected streams contain compatible codecs for MP4 container (H.264/H.265 for video, AAC/MP3 for audio)\n\nIf you encounter codec compatibility issues, replace `-c copy` with `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` to force re-encoding with MP4-compatible codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The command generated accurately reflects the user's requirements to select specific video and audio streams from the input file and save them in the desired output format.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command produced is valid and uses appropriate parameters and syntax for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command adheres to the requirements stated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the desired video and audio streams and the `-c copy` option to copy those streams without re-encoding, as supported by the man page. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass since it does not contain any issues, and it effectively meets the user's request, providing a correct and valid `ffmpeg` command."
