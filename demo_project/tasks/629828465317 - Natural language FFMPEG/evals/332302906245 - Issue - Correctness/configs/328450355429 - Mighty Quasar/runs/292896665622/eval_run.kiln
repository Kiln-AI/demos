  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction, we'll use the `rotate` filter for rotation and the `hqdn3d` filter for noise reduction.\n\n- `rotate=90*PI/180:cw` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise (note: `PI` is a predefined constant in `ffmpeg` and `cw` means clockwise).\n- `hqdn3d=2.5:1.5:6:6` applies the `hqdn3d` noise reduction filter with advanced settings. The parameters are:\n  - First value (`2.5`): luma spatial frequency (higher values reduce more noise but may blur details).\n  - Second value (`1.5`): chroma spatial frequency (similar to luma but for color).\n  - Third value (`6`): luma temporal frequency (higher values reduce more temporal noise).\n  - Fourth value (`6`): chroma temporal frequency (similar to luma temporal but for color).\n\nAssumptions: The input video codec and container are compatible with `ffmpeg`, and the noise reduction filter's strength is a balance between removing noise and preserving detail.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90*PI/180:cw,hqdn3d=2.5:1.5:6:6\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\nNote: Adjust the `hqdn3d` parameters to fine-tune noise reduction based on your video's specific needs. Higher values will generally reduce more noise but may impact video quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated should work correctly based on the provided user input. It includes appropriate filters for rotation and noise reduction, and the overall construction of the command follows the expected format of `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90*PI/180:cw,hqdn3d=2.5:1.5:6:6\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4`) contains valid options and parameters. The example of a failure refers to an invalid preset, which is not the case here.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The rotation syntax and noise reduction filter are correctly applied, and the command structure aligns with the expected input and output specifications as per the man page guidelines.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a valid `ffmpeg` command tailored to the user's request accurately. Therefore, it should be considered a passing output."
