  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect in ffmpeg, you chain multiple filters using the `-vf` option and separate them with commas. Filters are applied sequentially in the order specified.\n\nExample:\n- Apply a blur filter (e.g., `boxblur`).\n- Then overlay text using the `drawtext` filter.\n\nAssuming you want a slight blur with `boxblur=10:1` and overlay white text at position (10,30) with font size 24, hereâ€™s a command example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur=10:1,drawtext=text='Sample Text':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=30\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `boxblur=10:1` applies a mild blur.\n- `drawtext=...` overlays text on the blurred video.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nYou can adjust the blur parameters, text, positioning, fonts, and other drawtext options as needed. Just chain filters with commas inside the `-vf` string.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is syntactically correct and fits the user's request to overlay text and apply a blur effect. It correctly uses the `-vf` option to chain the filters and specifies the parameters for both the blur effect and the text overlay.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model specifies valid filters, and the syntax follows the correct structure for ffmpeg commands. The parameters used, like `boxblur` and `drawtext`, are valid and appropriately formatted.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used are valid, and the chaining of filters with commas in the `-vf` option follows the correct usage as per the documentation. \n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues described, it passes the evaluation. The command generated correctly overlays text and applies a blur effect as requested by the user, and adheres to the necessary syntax and options for ffmpeg without any errors."
