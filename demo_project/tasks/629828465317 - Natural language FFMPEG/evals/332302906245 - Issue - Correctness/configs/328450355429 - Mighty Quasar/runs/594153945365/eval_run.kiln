  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To preserve the alpha channel (transparency) when converting to WebM with VP9, you need to use VP9's lossless alpha mode. The key points are:\n\n- c:v libvpx-vp9 selects the VP9 encoder\n- -pix_fmt yuva420p ensures the alpha channel is included (note the 'a' for alpha)\n- (-b:v 0 -crf 30) sets lossless mode (-b:v 0 required for lossless VP9 alpha). The CRF value can be adjusted for quality; lower=less compression\n- -c:a libvorbis (or -c:a copy) specifies audio codec. I'll use vorbis as the standard webm audio format\n- -f webm explicitly sets the output format\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -b:v 0 -crf 30 -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears technically correct and matches the user's request to convert `multitrack.mov` to a WebM file using VP9 while preserving the alpha channel for transparency.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided failure example of a command that would fail due to the existence of a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`). The command it provided includes valid parameters and codecs that are recognized and valid per the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used in the command, including `-c:v libvpx-vp9`, `-pix_fmt yuva420p`, and `-c:a libvorbis`, are all valid and appropriate for the task of encoding a video in WebM format with VP9 and an alpha channel.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model meets the specified requirements and does not contain any mistakes, it should **pass** the evaluation."
