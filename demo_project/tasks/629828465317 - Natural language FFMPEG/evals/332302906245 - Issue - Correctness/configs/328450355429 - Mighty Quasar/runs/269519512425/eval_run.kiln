    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model matches the user's request to map specific streams from the input file and create a new file. The command appears to be syntactically correct and functionally correct based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is correctly formatted and uses the `-map` options, which are valid options in `ffmpeg`. There is no indication of a non-existent option like \"extra_fast\" in the model's output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-map` is appropriate for specifying which streams to include, and `-c copy` is valid for copying the streams without re-encoding. It adheres to the general syntax and structure dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and it accurately processes the userâ€™s request without violating any syntax or functional requirements of `ffmpeg`. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
