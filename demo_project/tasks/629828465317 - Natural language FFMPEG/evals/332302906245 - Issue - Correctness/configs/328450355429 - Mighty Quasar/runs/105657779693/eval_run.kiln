  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "Okay, here's an `ffmpeg` command to chain stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations. I'll explain each part and the assumptions I've made.\n\nThe command uses a filtergraph to apply the filters in sequence.  It's important to note that the order of filters can matter, and this order is generally a good starting point.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n-vf \"\n  # Stabilization\n  deshake=rx=30:ry=30:edge=soft,\n\n  # Color Grading (adjust values as needed)\n  eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.1:gamma=1.2,\n\n  # Geometric Transformation (rotate and scale)\n  scale=1280:720,\n  rotate=10,\n\n  #Reverse the filtergraph\n  format=yuv420p\n\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **`deshake`**: This is the stabilization filter.\n    *   `rx=30:ry=30`:  These values control the search area for stabilization.  Higher values search a larger area, which can be better for larger shakes, but might also introduce warping.  Adjust these based on the severity of the shakes in your footage.\n    *   `edge=soft`:  This specifies how to handle edges of the frame during stabilization. `soft` is generally a good choice to avoid harsh artifacts.\n*   **`eq`**: This filter performs equalization, which is a basic form of color correction.\n    *   `brightness=0.1`: Increases brightness by 10%. Adjust this to suit your footage.\n    *   `contrast=1.1`: Increases contrast by 10%. Adjust this to suit your footage.\n    *   `gamma=1.2`: Adjusts the gamma curve.  A value of 1.2 often improves the look of footage that appears too dark.\n*   **`scale=1280:720`**: This resizes the video to 720p.  I've used 1280 for the width, which is a common aspect ratio for 720p.  Adjust these values if you want a different resolution.\n*   **`rotate=10`**: This rotates the video by 10 degrees.  Adjust the angle as needed.\n*   **`format=yuv420p`**: This ensures the output is in the `yuv420p` format, which is widely compatible with different players and devices.  This is important for avoiding playback issues.\n*   **`-c:v libx264`**:  Specifies the H.264 video codec.\n*   **`-preset slow`**:  Sets the encoding speed. `slow` provides better compression (smaller file size for the same quality) than faster presets.\n*   **`-crf 23`**:  Sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for quality.  Lower values mean higher quality (and larger file sizes). 23 is a good starting point; values between 18-28 are generally recommended.\n*   **`-c:a copy`**:  Copies the audio stream from the input file without re-encoding. This is faster and avoids quality loss if the audio is already in a suitable format.\n*   **`output.mp4`**:  Specifies the output file name.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   The input file is `input.mp4`.  Change this to the actual name of your file.\n*   You want to maintain the aspect ratio during scaling. The `scale` filter will resize the video to fit within the specified dimensions, potentially adding black bars if the aspect ratio doesn't match.\n*   The video is already encoded in a format that `ffmpeg` can handle (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV).\n*   You want to preserve the audio stream.\n*   The stabilization is needed to correct camera shake.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Filter Order:** The order of filters in the filtergraph can affect the result. Experiment with the order to find what works best for your footage.\n*   **Parameter Tuning:** The values for `deshake`, `eq`, `scale`, and `rotate` are just starting points. You'll likely need to adjust them to get the desired results for your specific footage.\n*   **Performance:** Stabilization can be computationally intensive.  Encoding with a slower preset (`slow`) will take longer.\n*   **Testing:** Always test the command on a small portion of your footage before processing the entire file.\n\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated includes valid filters and options that are appropriate for the transformations requested by the user (stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations). However, it incorrectly organizes the filters without considering proper chaining of operations, such as `rotate` being after `scale` should be a concern, which vilifies the expected execution order for the filters applied.\n\n2) The output generated by the model does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command is structured correctly in terms of syntax and uses valid FFmpeg filters, unlike the failing output example where invalid or nonexistent option was presented. \n\n3) The command in the output does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used are valid and conform to the expected structure of FFmpeg commands. However, the order of effects (filters) should ideally respect their dependencies and possible interactions to ensure the desired result. In this case, `rotate` should ideally come before `scale` for proper visual output, as scaling after rotation can produce unexpected results visually.\n\n4) The model's output does contain a minor issue in the execution order of filters, as mentioned above. The chaining should ensure that the geometric transformations (like `rotate`) occur before scaling operations to maintain the visual fidelity of the footage. Therefore, while the command itself works, it may not produce the desired results based on the assumed order of operations. \n\nGiven these evaluations, the output command performs adequately but is not fully optimal due to filter ordering considerations. Hence it would partially fail the evaluation for being potentially ineffective, although technically valid in syntax."
