    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The output is incoherent and does not present a valid `ffmpeg` command. There is no identifiable structure or command conveyed, making it impossible to execute successfully.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failing example. Both the model output and the failure example lack a coherent command to process, and in this case, the model failed to provide any command at all, resulting in a complete failure.\n\n3) The model did not produce any `ffmpeg` command which could be evaluated against the man page, hence it cannot be determined if any specific requirements were broken. However, it fundamentally fails to create a valid command as per `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does contain the issue described. The model completely failed to generate a useful `ffmpeg` command that addresses the user's request. Thus, it fails the evaluation."
