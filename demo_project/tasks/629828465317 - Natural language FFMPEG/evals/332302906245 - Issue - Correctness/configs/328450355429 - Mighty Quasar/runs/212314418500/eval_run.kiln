  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise and apply strong noise reduction, we'll use the transpose filter for rotation and combine multiple denoising filters for maximum noise reduction.\n\n- `transpose=1` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5` applies high-quality 3D denoiser with strong settings (luma spatial=4, chroma spatial=3, luma temporal=6, chroma temporal=4.5)\n- `nlmeans=s=7.0:p=7:r=15` applies Non-Local Means denoising with strong noise reduction (strength=7.0, patch size=7, research window=15)\n- `bm3d=sigma=8.0` applies Block-Matching 3D denoising with high sigma value for strong noise reduction\n\nThe filters are chained together with commas. I'm assuming you want to keep the same video codec and just apply the filters - if you need specific encoding settings, you can add codec parameters.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5,nlmeans=s=7.0:p=7:r=15,bm3d=sigma=8.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: This will be very slow due to the intensive noise reduction filters, especially nlmeans and bm3d. For faster processing with still good results, you could use just `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5` or reduce the nlmeans parameters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5,nlmeans=s=7.0:p=7:r=15,bm3d=sigma=8.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4`) appears to be valid for the specified task of rotating the video and applying strong noise reduction filters. The filters used for noise reduction are recognized filters in FFmpeg. The resultant command should work to fulfill the user's request.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. In contrast to the failure example provided, the model's output generates a command with existing and appropriate filters, which do not violate any command syntax or logic.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The filters applied for rotation and noise reduction are correctly formatted and exist in FFmpeg. The usage of `-vf` to apply video filters, and `-c:a copy` to copy the audio stream without modification, conforms to the guidelines outlined in the man page.\n\nTherefore, the model's output is appropriate, correctly implements the userâ€™s request, and does not contain any issues as outlined in the evaluation steps. The command generated should function as expected."
