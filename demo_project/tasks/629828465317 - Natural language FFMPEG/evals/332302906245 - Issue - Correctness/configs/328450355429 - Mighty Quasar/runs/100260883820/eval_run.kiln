  "input": "I need to apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence to clean up an old video file.",
  "output": "To clean up an old video file by applying noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening in sequence, you can use the following filters in order:\n\n1. **Noise Reduction:** Use `hqdn3d`, a high-quality denoiser for both luma and chroma.\n2. **Color Correction:** Use `eq` to adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, or gamma as needed (customize these parameters for your content).\n3. **Sharpening:** Use `unsharp` to enhance the perceived sharpness.\n\n**Example (tune the eq parameters as needed):**\n- `hqdn3d=1.5:1.5:6:6` for moderate noise reduction (luma:chroma values can be tweaked).\n- `eq=contrast=1.1:brightness=0.02:saturation=1.2:gamma=1.0` for mild color correction (adjust as needed).\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0` for basic sharpening.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=1.5:1.5:6:6,eq=contrast=1.1:brightness=0.02:saturation=1.2:gamma=1.0,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Input is `input.mp4`.  \n- You want to keep the original audio (`-c:a copy`).  \n- These filter settings are generic starting points; for best results, adjust parameters to match your actual footage characteristics.  \n- All processing is done in sequence as per your request.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command is valid and corresponds accurately to the user's request, applying the specified filters for noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening in the correct order. Thus, it should work correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example because all options and filters used in the generated command are valid per FFmpeg's documentation. The command provided does not contain any nonexistent option or parameter in the FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, the command generated in the model's output adheres to the requirements. The filters used (`hqdn3d`, `eq`, `unsharp`) are valid filters in FFmpeg, and the syntax follows the prescribed structure for filter options. The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) Since the command generated is valid, it accurately adheres to the user's requirements, and does not contain any incorrect or invalid parameters or options, the evaluation indicates that it should pass."
