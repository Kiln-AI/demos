  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC using the FLAC audio codec in experimental mode for higher compression quality (though keep in mind experimental codecs may be less compatible), you should use `-c:a flac` with the `flacExperimental` parameter.\n\nThe `ffflac` ffmpeg build supports `flacExperimental` which enables experimental features like higher compression modes. The `-c:a flacExperimental` option specifies this.\n\nFor noise reduction, you can use the `-vn` flag to disable video processing, so the audio is processed first, which minimizes the impact on quality. Then, you can use the `-af flac:nf noise-reduction` filter chain that includes noise reduction.\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\n- `-vn` ensures all video processing is skipped so only audio is processed.\n- `-c:a flac -c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding (speeds up the process and avoids quality loss).\n- `-af flac:nf noise-reduction` applies noise reduction before encoding to FLAC.\n- `-flist flac` forces output format to FLAC for compatibility with players expecting it.\n\nAssuming you have a modern ffmpeg build with `ffflac` compiled with experimental options and you're running on Unix-like systems or Windows with ffmpeg build options set for `-fl format=flacExperimental`.\n\nIf you want to use noise reduction filter (since you asked for noise reduction explicitly), here's the command explaining each step:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:v copy -c:a flac -c:a flacExperimental -af flac:nf=lrm=1.05 noiseflac.flac\n```\n\nThis command extracts audio only, copies video quickly, and applies a value of `1.05` for `lfm` (noise floor multiplier) in the flacpressor style noise reduction filter, which is a common approach for noise reduction in flac encoded audio. Adjust the `lfm` value as needed (typically values between 0 and 2 are common). \n\nIf you want to use another noise reduction filter please advise.\n\n---\n\nSummarizing:\n- Extract audio only.\n- Copy video stream as-is for speed and preserve quality.\n- Use `-c:a flacExperimental` to enable experimental FLAC encoding for potentially better compression.\n- Apply noise reduction via `-af flac:nf=...`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:v copy -c:a flac -c:a flacExperimental -af flac:nf=lrm=1.05 noiseflac.flac\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "The evaluation of the model's output based on the provided user message and the generated command can be broken down as follows:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output contains multiple inaccuracies. Firstly, the command suggests using a non-existent option `flacExperimental` with `-c:a`, which is not a standard or valid option in ffmpeg. Moreover, it improperly uses `-c:v copy` despite the user request solely focused on audio extraction, where including a video codec would be unnecessary and confusing. Also, the `-af flac:nf noise-reduction` filter chain is incorrect because the correct syntax for noise reduction in ffmpeg is different from what has been provided.\n\n   **Result:** The model's output contains issues.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, the output contains a command that is likely to fail due to the incorrect use of the audio codec (`flacExperimental`). Therefore, it can be considered similar to the example where an invalid codec is specified.\n\n   **Result:** The output is similar to the failing output example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command generated by the model breaks requirements as per the ffmpeg man page:\n   - The option `-c:a flacExperimental` does not exist. The correct usage for FLAC would simply be `-c:a flac`.\n   - The noise reduction syntax specified is not valid in ffmpeg. There is no `flac:nf` option in the audio filters.\n   - The inclusion of `-c:v copy` for an audio extraction task is unnecessary and could lead to confusion.\n\n   **Result:** Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Overall Evaluation:**\n   Based on the analysis above:\n   - The command's structure contains invalid options and syntax.\n   - It fails to meet the user request accurately, leading to potential execution failures.\n\n**Final Evaluation:** The model's output fails as it contains significant issues that render the command incorrect for the intended task."
