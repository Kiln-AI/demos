  "output": "To apply temporal and spatial filters together using your specified chain:\n\n- `yadif=mode=1` deinterlaces the video with temporal and spatial mode (mode=1).\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the video to 1920x1080 resolution.\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0` applies a sharpening filter on the luma channel with the specified matrix size and amount.\n\nThese filters are combined in a single `-vf` filtergraph by comma separation, which applies them sequentially.\n\nAssuming the input is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4` with libx264 encoding for typical usage:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nHere:\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23` encodes video with reasonable quality/speed.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream as-is.\n\nAdjust input/output names as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is complete and adheres to the user's request accurately, applying the specified filters in the right order. The components of the command (deinterlacing, scaling, sharpening) match the user's requirements directly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model is structured correctly and adheres to the functionality expected from ffmpeg, unlike the example which contained an invalid preset.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command generated by the model does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid options and correctly sets the order of inputs and outputs, ensuring that the specified filters are applied in the generated output file. The output file's encoding options (libx264 and copy for audio) are also valid according to the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n   The model's output should pass. It generates a valid ffmpeg command that fulfills the user's requirements without any issues."
