  "output": "To extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of the input file broadcast.ts and combine them into a single output file, you can use the `-map` option to specify the input streams.\n\n- `-map` options specify which input streams to use for the output streams. Here, we're selecting video from stream 10 (`0:10` means input file 0, stream 10) and audio from stream 18 (`0:18`).\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` indicate that we want to copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding them, assuming the formats are compatible with the output container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.ts\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input file `broadcast.ts` contains at least 19 streams (since we're referencing streams 10 and 18).\n- The video and audio formats in these streams are compatible with the output container (TS, in this case). If not, you might need to re-encode the streams using appropriate codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated correctly uses the `-map` options to specify the streams to extract from the input file, and the parameters `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` are appropriate for copying the selected video and audio streams without re-encoding them.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command does not include any incorrect parameters like a non-existent preset. Instead, it correctly uses standard options with proper syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The `-map` options are used correctly to specify the input streams for video and audio, and `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` are valid commands to copy the streams.\n\n4) The output does not contain the issue described. The command is constructed correctly, meets the user's requirements, and utilizes valid FFmpeg parameters. Therefore, it should be marked as passing the evaluation."
