  "output": "To convert input.mkv to AVI format using the libx265 codec at maximum compression, you should choose a very slow encoding preset like \"placebo\" (as requested, for the highest compression and best quality/size tradeoff) and explicitly specify that the output container is AVI. \n\nHowever, note that the AVI container may have limited support for newer codecs like HEVC (H.265). If compatibility or playback issues are expected with AVI + HEVC, consider using a more modern container such as MP4 or MKV. But since the request is to convert to AVI with libx265, the command below demonstrates this.\n\n- `-c:v libx265` selects the H.265/HEVC encoder.\n- `-preset placebo` is the slowest preset, offering biggest compression/quality gain.\n- `-x265-params` can be used for encoder-specific parameters if needed.\n- `-c:a` defaults to copying audio in this example, but you might want to re-encode (e.g., to AAC) depending on your needs.\n- For maximum quality/size tradeoff, could adjust CRF (Constant Rate Factor); default h.265 CRF is 28, typically use 18-28 for good quality.\n- The output filename extension `.avi` to enforce the AVI container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -crf 28 -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\nThis command uses CRF 28 for a relatively high-quality H.265 stream (adjust lower for better quality), copies the audio as-is, and forces AVI output. If audio compatibility is a concern, you could replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` or similar.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It provides a valid FFmpeg command that matches the user's requirements of converting an MKV file to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset. The command is correctly structured, and the parameters used are valid in the context of FFmpeg functionality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain an incorrect preset name or any other components that could lead to command failure. Instead, it accurately utilizes existing FFmpeg parameters to achieve the desired conversion.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. While it's worth noting that using libx265 in an AVI container may lead to compatibility issues since AVI is not typically used with HEVC codecs, the command itself is syntactically correct and adheres to the requirements laid out in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output passes since it successfully generates a command that satisfies the user's request without any errors or failures."
