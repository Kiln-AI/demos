  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "For your request: A stabilization filter increases smoothness, color grading adjusts the color tones of footage, and geometry transformations apply rotation and scaling.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf stabilizer=y:v=1:r=1 -vf color=yuv1234 -yuv420p -vf color=yuv420p=x365:y365:ar=1.77:1=fps=23.976:1 -vf color=yuv420p=x140:y140:ar=1.71:1:yadif=inter:picrate=23.976:i=10:vmaxrate=23.976:16:97.95=hq:1 scale=1920:1080 -vf pan=x128:y128 -vf scale=1080:720,eq1_lut=/path/to/equalize/lut.txt,eq1_gain=1.2:1.0 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nTo achieve the chained transformations, I assumed:\n\n- The input film has shaky footage and needs stabilization.\n- You wish to add a subtle, graded tone to the footage (color grading) after stabilization.\n- Geometry involves translating and scaling the image horizontally to match an original frame, making possible subsequent equalization.\n- The aim is to turn the input into 720p suitable for streaming (1080Ã—1920 resized), eliminating noticeable distortion or image detail that could reduce bandwidth.\n- The color equalization is tied to the new geometry to handle dynamic tone changes.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command contains multiple `-vf` (video filter) options one after another, which would lead to syntax errors. Each video filter should be specified in a single `-vf` option with a single comma-separated list. Additionally, there are incorrect and nonsensical parameters, like `color=yuv420p=x365:y365:ar=1.77:1=fps=23.976:1`, which seems to be a malformed color grading setting.\n\n2) The output is indeed similar to the failure example. The command contains errors and is not valid because it incorrectly chains `-vf` filters without properly formatting them, and it uses options that do not align with `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks several requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. Key points include:\n   - Video filters must be combined correctly into a single `-vf` option rather than using multiple `-vf` flags.\n   - Some parameters, like `color=yuv420p=x365`, do not conform to the expected input formats and criteria outlined in the man page.\n   - There are inconsistencies and logical errors in how the transformations and settings are applied in context.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does contain the issue described, produces a failing command, and does break requirements in the `ffmpeg` man page. Therefore, it should be marked as a failure."
