  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode subtitles onto a video, use the `subtitles` filter in ffmpeg. This filter reads the provided subtitle file and burns the subtitles directly into the video frames. I'm assuming the `subtitles.srt` file is in the same directory as `movie.mkv`.  To make the subtitles yellow, I'll set the `force_style` option.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='Fontcolor=Yellow'\" output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly hardcodes the subtitles from `subtitles.srt` onto the `movie.mkv` file and formats the subtitles to be yellow. There are no obvious errors in the command itself.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and correctly applies a filter to hardcode subtitles, while the example provided does not form a valid command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. Although the `force_style` parameter is not explicitly documented in the provided summary (it could be an advanced option), it is a recognized way to specify styles in ffmpeg subtitles processing. Therefore, the command appears to be valid according to usual usage with ffmpeg's subtitle filter.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and is functioning correctly. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation."
