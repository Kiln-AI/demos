  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using the `deshake` filter in `ffmpeg`, the tool will analyze and shift the video frames to reduce camera shaking effects. This is typically done by evaluating motion vectors and then applying compensating shifts to even out the motion.\n\nHere are the key parameters and assumptions:\n- I assume you are okay with default parameters (`deshake` without options) which provide a balanced stabilization.\n- The output file is named `stable_output.mp4`.\n- Audio will be copied without re-encoding to maintain quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy stable_output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy stable_output.mp4`) is syntactically correct for the task of stabilizing the video using the `deshake` filter. There are no apparent errors in the command, and it meets the user's requirements without breaking any specified rules.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command incorporates valid options, and there are no incorrect parameters like the non-existent `extra_fast` preset in the failure example. The options here are all appropriate for the `ffmpeg` tool when applying the `deshake` filter.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows proper syntax: specifying the input file with `-i`, applying the video filter with `-vf`, and setting the audio codec with `-c:a`. The use of `-c:a copy` to maintain audio quality is also justified and compliant with typical usage.\n\n4) Considering all the above points, the model's output is accurate and functions as expected for the user's request. It does not contain any issues and therefore passes the evaluation."
