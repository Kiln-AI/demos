  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To stabilize and transform shaky video footage, ffmpeg provides a sequence of filters that can be applied in a single command. The ` vidstabtransform ` filter is used for stabilization, while ` scale ` and ` rotate ` enable scaling and rotation. You can also add ` lut ` or ` curves ` to adjust color grading.\n\nHere's how it typically works:\n- ` vidstabdetect ` (run once) analyzes the video and generates transformation data (`transforms.trf`).\n- ` vidstabtransform ` applies the stabilization using the data.\n- Color grading can be adjusted using the `lutrgb` or `curves` filter (example uses `eq` for simplicity).\n- The `scale` and `rotate` filters apply geometric transformations.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You already have installed the `vidstab` library, as stabilization requires it.\n- You already have shaky footage named `input.mp4`.\n- You want 1080p output after scaling and a 30-degree counter-clockwise rotation.\n- Basic color grading is done via brightness/contrast and saturation adjustments.\n\n```bash\n# Step 1: First run to generate stabilization transformation data (run once)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15 -f null -\n\n# Step 2: Apply stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformation\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform= input=transforms.trf,setpts=PTS-STARTPTS,eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5,scale=1920:1080:flags=bicubic,rotate=30*PI/180\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nMake sure to run the stabilization detection (`vidstabdetect`) first before processing the full video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output does not seem to contain the specific issue of mistakes in generating the `ffmpeg` command, as the provided commands appear to be syntactically correct and appropriate for the described task of stabilizing, color grading, and applying geometric transformations.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command provided is structured correctly and does not include invalid presets or parameters like `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page of `ffmpeg`. The options used in the command are consistent with the available filters and syntax as per the documentation. The filters such as `vidstabdetect`, `vidstabtransform`, `scale`, `rotate`, and `eq` are also valid and match with their description in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation of the steps, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is well-formed and adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. The output correctly addresses the user's request and follows the proper syntax for using multiple filters in a single command."
