  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise, we use the `transpose` video filter with the value `1`. For advanced noise reduction, the `wnnmee` filter (Weighted Noise Noise Reduction with Median Filtering) can be used, which is one of the stronger noise reduction filters available in FFmpeg. The `preset` parameter can be adjusted to balance quality and speed—using `slow` will provide the highest quality but take longer to process.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input video is in a standard format compatible with FFmpeg.\n- The rotation will be applied while maintaining the original aspect ratio and resolution.\n- You want the strongest noise reduction available without excessive loss of detail or performance.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1, wnnmee\" -preset slow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as defined in the issue description. The command it generated correctly reflects the user's request to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction. It incorporates the proper syntax and applies the relevant filters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command produced does not contain an invalid parameter like `extra_fast`; instead, it uses a valid filter and parameters based on the user request.\n\n3) The command aligns with the requirements detailed in the FFmpeg man page. The options used are consistent with FFmpeg's syntax rules, meaning the order of options is correct and fits the expected input-output structure.\n\n4) The command appears to be appropriately constructed without any violations of FFmpeg’s command specifications. Given all the above considerations, it does not contain the defined issues and successfully meets the task requirements.\n\nFinal Evaluation: The model's output passes all checks and is deemed to have performed correctly on the task."
