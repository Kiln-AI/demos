  "output": "To convert your file with a constant bitrate of 25000k (25 Mbps) for the video stream, I'll use the `-b:v` parameter to set a constant bitrate and `-maxrate`/`-bufsize` to ensure strict bitrate control.\n\n- `-b:v 25000k` sets the target video bitrate to 25 Mbps\n- `-maxrate 25000k` and `-bufsize 50000k` enforce strict bitrate limits (bufsize is typically 1-2x the bitrate)\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 encoding (assumed since you didn't specify codec)\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio with AAC at 128 kbps (assuming you want audio preserved)\n\nI'm assuming you want to keep the original resolution and that your input file is named \"input\" with an appropriate extension. I'm outputting to MP4 format as it's widely compatible.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: 25 Mbps is quite high and will result in large file sizes. This bitrate is typically used for high-quality archival or professional work.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is valid and specifies a constant bitrate of 25 Mbps for the video stream, which matches the user's requirement. The parameters used also comply with ffmpeg's usage as set out in the documentation.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is correctly formatted and does not use any nonexistent options; all parameters are valid for the task it is trying to perform.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are valid according to the documentation, and the order of options is maintained correctly, ensuring that each option applies to the correct output stream.\n\n4) Considering the analysis above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation."
