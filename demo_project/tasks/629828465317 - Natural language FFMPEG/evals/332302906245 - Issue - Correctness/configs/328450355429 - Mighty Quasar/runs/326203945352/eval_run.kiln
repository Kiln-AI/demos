  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` with yellow text, FFmpeg uses the `subtitles` filter to burn the subtitles directly into the video frames. The `force_style` argument overrides default subtitle styling, setting `FontColor` to `yellow` (valid in SSA/ASS style syntax). Since the SRT file lacks styling by default, FFmpeg may require a system font and pixel-perfect rendering. The command assumes the output is MP4 (compatible with common codecs like H.264/AAC) and sets:\n\n- `-vf subtitles=...` to embed subtitles and apply styling.\n- `-c:v libx264` for H.264 video encoding (MP4 requirement).\n- `-c:a aac` for standardized audio encoding.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` to ensure broad compatibility.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontColor=yellow'\" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- Subtitles in `subtitles.srt` match the video's duration and timing.\n- The system has access to a default font (Arial) or native rendering fonts.\n- `yellow` is a valid named color in your system's SSA style engine (FFmpeg supports 8-bit hex color codes like `00ffff00` as well).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated is valid for hardcoding subtitles into a video file, and it does not contain any obvious errors that would render it ineffective. Thus, it passes this evaluation step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontColor=yellow'\" -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4`) is constructed according to FFmpeg's syntax and applies appropriate parameters for hardcoding subtitles, while the failing example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) has invalid parameters. Therefore, this evaluation step is passed as well.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used (such as `-vf` for video filters and `-c:v` for setting the video codec) adhere to the command syntax outlined in the man page, and they are applied to the correct input and output files. Consequently, this evaluation step is also passed.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate for the user request and follows the rules and guidelines specified in the FFmpeg man page. Therefore, it passes this evaluation step."
