  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from an input file, you use the `-map` option. Stream indices start from 0, so the second video stream is `0:v:1` and the fourth audio stream is `0:a:3`. These will be included in the output, keeping their original codecs unless specified otherwise.\n\nHere's the command assuming you want to copy these streams without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream from input 0.\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- The output container is `.mkv` (Matroska) since it supports multiple streams flexibly; you can change it if you prefer.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated appears to correctly map the specified video and audio streams according to the user's request, using the correct syntax and parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv`) correctly uses valid options and mappings, unlike the provided example of a failing output which uses a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The command adheres to expected usage regarding the order of options and stream selection using the `-map` option. The use of `-c copy` for copying the original streams is also consistent with ffmpeg behavior.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; it successfully meets the user's request without errors or misuse of options, therefore it should pass the evaluation."
