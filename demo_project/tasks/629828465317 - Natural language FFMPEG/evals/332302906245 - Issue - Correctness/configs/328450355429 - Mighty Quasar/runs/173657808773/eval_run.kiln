  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To extract video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of the input file `source.mkv` and map them into a new MP4 file `edited.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. This allows you to specify which streams to include in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:3` selects the 4th video stream (index 3) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:5` selects the 6th audio stream (index 5) from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding, which is faster and preserves quality.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-f mp4` specifies the output format as MP4.\n\nThis assumes that the input file has at least 6 streams (0:0 to 0:5), and that the 4th stream is a video stream and the 6th is an audio stream. It also assumes you want to copy streams rather than re-encode them.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy edited.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate for mapping specific video and audio streams from the input file to the output file, which aligns well with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is accurate and does not contain any invalid parameters. All specified options and parameters are valid for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly follows the format, uses valid options, and respects the order of parameters necessary for proper execution.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a command that effectively maps the required streams without any mistakes or invalid options. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
