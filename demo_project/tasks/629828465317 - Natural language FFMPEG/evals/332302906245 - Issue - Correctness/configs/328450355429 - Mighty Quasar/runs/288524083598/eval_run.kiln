  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert `video.webm` to MP4 with **libvpx-vp9 (VP9 video codec)** using **constant bitrate (CBR)** mode, the video stream is re-encoded with `-b:v` (target bitrate) and matched `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` to enforce strict CBR (unlike variable bitrate 2-pass used by default for VP9). Audio is re-encoded to AAC (common MP4 format) for compatibility, assuming the original WebM audio is not AAC. The pixel format `yuv420p` ensures broad playback support.\n\n- `c:v libvpx-vp9`: Use VP9 video codec.\n- `b:v [BITRATE]`: Set constant video bitrate (replace `[BITRATE]` with a value like `5000k` for 5 Mbps).\n- `minrate/maxrate/bufsize`: Matched to ensure fixed bitrate.\n- `c:a aac`: AAC audio codec for MP4 compatibility.\n- `pix_fmt yuv420p`: For browser and device compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 5000k -minrate 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 5000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Original WebM audio (likely Vorbis/Opus) is re-encoded to AAC.  \n- Video bitrate is assumed to be 5 Mbps (`5000k`). Adjust `-b:v` and related options as needed for your content.  \n- Output is MP4 with VP9 video (less common for VP9 than WebM/MKV containers, but supported in modern encoders).",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step-by-step based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   The model's output does not contain command generation issues. The command provided is syntactically correct and all options are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation. It adheres to the requirement of converting a `.webm` file to MP4 format with the specified codec and bitrate settings. Thus, it should **pass** this criterion.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   The output is not similar to the failing example. The failure example provided an incorrect command with a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`). The command for the conversion of `video.webm` to MP4 using `libvpx-vp9` and CBR is valid and does not present any issues. Therefore, it should **pass** this criterion as well.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   After examining the command generated by the model:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 5000k -minrate 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 5000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n   ```\n   All parameters are valid according to the FFmpeg man page. The order of options is appropriately followed, and the syntax is correct. The options used conform to the definitions provided in the man page, and it does not violate any established rules. Hence, this command should **pass** this criterion.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nSince the command is syntactically correct, adheres to the requirements, and does not break any rules from the man page, the conclusion is that the model's output is accurate and should **pass** as it does not contain the described issue.\n\nOverall, the model's output is correct."
