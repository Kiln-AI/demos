  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "A classic use case!\n\nTo achieve this, you'll need to instruct `ffmpeg` to demux the original multi-track file, select the desired streams, and remux them into a single file.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.multiachannel.mp4 -map 6[out1] -map 9[out2] -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `-map 6` tells `ffmpeg` to select video stream #6 from the original file and output it as `out1`.\n* `-map 9` tells `ffmpeg` to select audio stream #9 from the original file and output it as `out2`.\n* `-c:v libx264` sets the H.264 video codec and sets the quality to a reasonable balance between compression and size.\n* `-crf 18` sets the quality of the video encoding (lower values result in higher quality, but larger file sizes).\n* `-c:a aac` sets the AAC audio codec.\n* `-b:a 128k` sets the bitrate of the audio to 128 kbps.\n* `output.mp4` is the desired output file name.\n\nNote: Make sure the numbers `6` and `9` match the actual stream numbers in your original multi-track file. You can inspect the original file's stream map using the `ffprobe` command: `ffprobe -v quiet -print_stream **/input.multiachannel.mp4` to see the stream indices.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue mentioned in the issue description. The command it generated is correctly structured to map the specified video and audio streams from the input file to produce the desired output file. All parameters relevant to mapping streams are correctly implemented as per the userâ€™s request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command generated is not only syntactically correct, but it also reflects an understanding of how to use `ffmpeg` to map streams accordingly. There is no usage of fictitious parameters like \"extra_fast\" that do not exist.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page. The usage of `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` options is in accordance with the syntax outlined in the man page. The commands provided follow the expectations of the options being applied to specific streams and output files.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output does not contain any issues, so it should pass the evaluation. The command generated by the model is valid and matches the requirements from the user."
