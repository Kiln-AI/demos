  "output": "To convert input.mp4 to an MKV container while re-encoding the video using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copying the audio stream, you should:\n\n- Use `-c:v libx265` to specify the x265 video codec.\n- Use `-preset veryslow` for maximum compression efficiency (longer encoding time, very good quality/size tradeoff).\n- `-c:a copy` will copy the audio stream without re-encoding to save time and preserve quality.\n- Output container is MKV by using `.mkv` extension; ffmpeg infers the container from the filename.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is correct and matches the user's request for converting `input.mp4` to MKV using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copying the audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mkv` uses valid options and parameters that are in line with the ffmpeg command syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-c:v libx265` specifies the video codec correctly, `-preset veryslow` is a valid preset (even though it is one of the slowest), and `-c:a copy` correctly copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nThus, based on the evaluation of the model's output, it passes all the criteria set forth in the evaluation steps."
