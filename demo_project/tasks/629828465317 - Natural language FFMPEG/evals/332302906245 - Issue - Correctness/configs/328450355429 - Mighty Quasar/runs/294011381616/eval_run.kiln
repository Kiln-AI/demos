  "input": "Convert input.mkv to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset for maximum compression",
  "output": "To convert `input.mkv` to AVI using libx265 (HEVC) with the placebo preset while preserving the original audio, you'll need to specify the codec for both video and audio. Since AVI is an older container format, it may not fully support HEVC, and compatibility issues might arise. The more modern containers such as MP4/MOV/MKV are preferred for h265. Also, be aware that the `placebo` preset with `libx265` will take a very long time. It's not recommended for general use.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `-i input.mkv`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx265`: Sets the video codec to libx265 (HEVC).\n- `-preset placebo`: Uses the \"placebo\" preset for maximum compression efficiency (at the cost of encoding speed).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding. This preserves the original audio quality and avoids compatibility issues that could arise from converting to a format unsupported by AVI.\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output based on the given criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly converts an MKV file to AVI using `libx265`, and specifies copying the audio, which matches the user's request. The user wanted a transformation to AVI format, and the model accommodated this in its command.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is computationally valid and follows the requirements of the task. The use of `libx265` and the configuration is appropriate, although there are notable compatibility concerns.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any fundamental requirements laid out in the man page. The model correctly follows the syntax and parameters for specifying codecs and formats. However, the model mentions potential compatibility issues with the AVI container and HEVC codec. While this is a valid point, it does not render the command itself incorrect; it simply indicates that while the command may technically work, it might not be functional in all scenarios.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation**  \nGiven the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described, is not similar to a clearly failing output example, and does not break any requirements found in the man page. However, it effectively raises a caution about potential issues with using HEVC in an AVI format, which is an important consideration. Overall, the output can be considered solid albeit with an advisory. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
