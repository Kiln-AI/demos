  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "Here's an explanation of the technique/parameters, followed by the needed command in triple backtick quotes.\n\nTo apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order, we need to use the following filter chain:\n\n1.  `iyadif` for temporal noise reduction\n2.  `deno3d` for spatial denoising\n3.  `enhanceedges` for edge enhancement\n\nAssuming you want to reduce the impact of very high frequency motion, I'll use `iyadif = 0.5:1` to start with. This filter chain should be applied in the order listed, so we use the `-f` option to specify the filter chain.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -f lavfi -i'I=yadif=0.5:1' -f lavfi -i'I=deno3d' -f lavfi -i'I=enhanceedges' -c:v lavfi output.mp4\n```\n\nNote that the filter chain is applied in the order listed (`I=yadif=0.5:1`, `I=deno3d`, `I=enhanceedges`), and the `-f` option tells `ffmpeg` to apply the specified filters. The `lavfi` input filter is used here, which is a generic filter that can be used to apply various filters to the input video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. It incorrectly utilizes the `-f lavfi` option in a way that is not appropriate for applying the specified filters directly in the filter chain. The command should use `-vf` to connect the filter chain instead of attempting to use multiple `-f lavfi -i` inputs for each filter.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example, as it generates a command that is unlikely to execute correctly due to incorrect syntax relating to the use of the `-f` and `-i` options. However, it doesn't match the specific faults of the given failure example, such as using a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page because the output command incorrectly combines filter applications using `-f lavfi` and `-i`, which is not how filter chains should be composed in `ffmpeg`. Instead of specifying separate filter inputs for each filter in the chain, the correct approach is to use the `-vf` parameter to specify a series of filters.\n\n4) Given all of the above, the model's output indeed contains the issues described and would fail to execute correctly."
