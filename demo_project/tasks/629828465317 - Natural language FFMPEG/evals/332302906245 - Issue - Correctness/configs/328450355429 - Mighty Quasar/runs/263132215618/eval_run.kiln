  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "The user wants to remap audio and video streams from a source file named `source.mkv`. They instruct to take video from streams 0 and 3 and audio from streams 0 and 5, and then save it as `edited.mp4`. In `ffmpeg`, this can be accomplished with the `-map` option followed by the mapping of streams.\n\nThe command below does as the user requested:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:0.0:0.1,0:2.0:0.1 -c:a copy -c:v copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `-i source.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:0.0:0.1,0:2.0:0.1` is the remapping command where the colon denotes the stream index followed by the fraction for the starting and ending stream numbers. The first set `0:0.0:0.1` means the first video stream (0.0), and the audio stream ranging from 0 to 3 (`0:2.0:0.1`).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio streams without re-encoding.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video streams without re-encoding, and since we're not applying any filters, no transformations are needed for the video.\n- `output.mp4` is the desired output filename.\n\nIn real applications, it's usually better to re-encode the files to ensure compatibility, but keeping the streams as-is here fulfills the user's requirement.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated, specifically the use of `-map 0:0.0:0.1,0:2.0:0.1`, is incorrect and does not align with the user's requirement of mapping video from stream `0:3` and audio from stream `0:5`. The correct format for using `-map` should specify the exact streams without additional fractional indexing, and further, the output filename should have been `edited.mp4` as specified by the user, but it mentioned `output.mp4` instead.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided since it does produce a valid format for the command structure. However, the contents of the command itself are incorrect in terms of stream mapping.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks the requirements from the man page. The mapping of streams does not match the user's request. The user requested to map video from stream `0:3` and audio from stream `0:5`, but the command used `-map 0:0.0:0.1,0:2.0:0.1`, which is incorrectly constructed and references streams that likely do not exist (given the original userâ€™s request). \n\n4) Given that the output does contain incorrect stream mappings and does not satisfy the user's input correctly, the model fails according to the evaluation criteria. The issues with stream mapping lead to the conclusion that it does not pass the evaluation."
