  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To force an extremely high bitrate of 100 Mbps for video and 512 kbps for audio, use `-b:v 100000k` (or the shorter `-b:v 100M`) and `-b:a 512k`. Because you're specifying raw bitrates, not a CRF-like mode, add `-maxrate 100000k -bufsize 200000k` so the encoder’s VBV buffer matches (helps players avoid stuttering). The output should still be standard MP4 with H.264 video, AAC audio, and yuv420p for maximum compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M -maxrate 100M -bufsize 200M -c:a aac -b:a 512k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your source file’s name and extension are replaced by “input.ext”.\n- You want H.264+AAC in an MP4 container (same as before).\n- You prefer the default presets; swap them in (e.g., `-preset slow`) if you care more about visual quality than encoding speed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates an appropriate ffmpeg command that matches the user requirements for high bitrates for both video and audio.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and does not include any incorrect options like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies the bitrates for video and audio, uses the appropriate codecs, and provides the additional necessary parameters for setting the max video bitrate and buffer size. All options follow the expected syntax and order.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues and adheres to the required specifications, it passes the evaluation. The command generated is:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M -maxrate 100M -bufsize 200M -c:a aac -b:a 512k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nThis command successfully aligns with the user input and the guidelines provided."
