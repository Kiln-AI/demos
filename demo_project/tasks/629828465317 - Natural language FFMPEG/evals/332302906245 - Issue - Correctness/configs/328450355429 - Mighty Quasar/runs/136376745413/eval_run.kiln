  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as a FLAC file, you typically use the libflac encoder. However, since you mentioned \"experimental codec,\" I assume you want to enable experimental features in ffmpeg, which can sometimes be necessary with newer or less common encoders. Noise reduction isn't built into ffmpeg's core audio encoding, but you can apply a filter like afftdn (Adaptive Filtered Time-Domain Noise Suppressor) before encoding.\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input.\n- `-af afftdn` applies noise reduction.\n- `-c:a flac` encodes audio as FLAC.\n- `-strict -2` enables experimental features, if needed for FLAC (though usually, it's not necessary for FLAC).\n- The output filename is `audio.flac`.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to keep the original audio quality after noise reduction.\n- Using `afftdn` is a common choice for noise reduction in ffmpeg.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict -2 audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is syntactically correct and appears to fulfill the userâ€™s request for extracting audio from a video file and saving it as a FLAC file with noise reduction applied.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not contain any invalid options or parameters, and therefore would not fail due to incorrect syntax.\n\n3) The command complies with the requirements described in the ffmpeg man page. All specified options are appropriate for the extraction of audio to a FLAC file and the application of noise reduction using the `afftdn` filter. The use of `-strict -2` (although usually not necessary for FLAC) is also valid. \n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and the command seems to work correctly based on the requirements from the user input. The ffmpeg command presented by the model appears valid and matches the user's request without any errors."
