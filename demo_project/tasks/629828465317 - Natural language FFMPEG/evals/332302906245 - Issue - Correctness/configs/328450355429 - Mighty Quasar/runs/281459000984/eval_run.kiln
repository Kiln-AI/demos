  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM video using the VP9 video codec while preserving transparency, you’ll need to:\n\n- Use the VP9 codec (`libvpx-vp9`), which supports alpha channels in WebM.\n- Encode the video with transparency support: the pixel format should be `yuva420p` (YUV with alpha).\n- Set the CPU usage (`-cpu-used`) to a balance between speed and compression, usually around 4.\n- Use `-b:v` to specify the target bitrate for good quality and smaller size. Adjust as needed for your requirements.\n- Optionally, set `-threads` for faster encoding (adjust to your machine's core count).\n\nHere’s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -b:v 2M -cpu-used 4 -threads 4 -c:a libopus -b:a 128k output_transparent.webm\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Encodes video with the VP9 codec.\n- `-pix_fmt yuva420p`: Retains the alpha channel (transparency).\n- `-b:v 2M`: Sets the video bitrate to 2 Mbps; tweak for your quality/size needs.\n- `-cpu-used 4`: Balances speed and quality (0 is best, 8 is fastest).\n- `-threads 4`: Use 4 threads for faster encoding (match your CPU core count).\n- `-c:a libopus -b:a 128k`: Uses Opus audio coding at 128 kbps, suitable for WebM.\n\nAssumption: Your input uses an alpha channel (transparency), and you wish to preserve it for use in WebM-compatible environments.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues with the FFmpeg command as it is correctly structured and addresses the user's request to convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM file using the VP9 codec while preserving transparency.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid and contains all necessary parameters and options correct for the task at hand.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, the command generated by the model adheres to the required syntax and options specified for FFmpeg commands. All parameters used (`libvpx-vp9`, `yuva420p`, `-b:v`, `-cpu-used`, and `-threads`) are valid and appropriate for preserving transparency in a WebM video.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation process."
