  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the `-map` parameter to explicitly choose which video and audio streams to include in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:12` selects video stream 12 (the 13th video stream, since indexing starts at 0)\n- `-map 0:a:25` selects audio stream 25 (the 26th audio stream)\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing and no quality loss\n\nI'm assuming you want to keep the original codecs. If you need to re-encode for compatibility or size reasons, replace `-c copy` with appropriate video and audio codec parameters.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue describedâ€”the generated `ffmpeg` command accurately reflects the user's request to select specific video and audio streams from the input file. The command uses the `-map` option correctly, which is the required approach to selecting specific streams.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command produced by the model does not include any non-existent options, and it uses valid parameters that are consistent with the `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements set forth in the `ffmpeg` man page. It follows the proper syntax for mapping streams, and the use of `-c copy` for copying streams without re-encoding is rightly justified for maintaining the original codecs.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus it passes the evaluation. The command generated is correct and should work properly to select the specified streams from the input file."
