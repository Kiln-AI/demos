  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from `recording.mkv`, use the `-map` option with zero-based stream indices. FFMPEG uses zero-based indexing, so stream 12 corresponds to index `12` for video and stream 25 corresponds to index `25` for audio. This command maps the specified streams and copies them without re-encoding (assuming compatibility with the output format).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The user is using zero-based stream indices (e.g., `0:v:12` refers to the 13th video stream in the file).  \n- The selected streams are compatible with the output format (MP4). If not, additional codec specifications may be required.  \n- No other streams are needed; only the specified video and audio streams are included.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly maps video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the input file `recording.mkv` and assumes compatibility without unnecessary parameters. The command is properly structured, aligning with the user's request, and the explanation provided is coherent and informative.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 output.mp4`) adheres to the correct format and does not contain any invalid parameters. Unlike the sample failing output, there are no syntax errors or non-existent options present.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the proper syntax for mapping streams with the `-map` parameters and utilizes the input file without any conflicting options or errors.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does *not* contain the issue described. The command is accurate, well-structured, and effectively meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should be marked as a successful response."
