The model did not generate a valid `ffmpeg` command at all; instead, the output appears to be garbled text that does not relate to any proper command structure or syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is very similar to the example of a failing output. The failure example provided a non-working `ffmpeg` command, while the model's output does not resemble a recognizable command at all, making it even more unsuitable as a valid command.\n\n3) As the model's output does not resemble any `ffmpeg` command and is not formatted correctly, it does not adhere to the requirements from the `ffmpeg` man page. Since it is neither valid syntax nor a meaningful command, it fails to comply with any of the instructions for generating an `ffmpeg` command.\n\n4) Given that the model's output fails to produce a coherent command, it clearly does contain the issue described in the issue description. Hence, it fails the evaluation."
