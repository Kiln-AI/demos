    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The output command correctly maps the specified second video stream and fourth audio stream from the input file `complex.avi` to the output file `out.avi`. There are no syntax errors or improper use of command parameters. The command is valid for the given task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is correctly formatted and specifies valid input and output stream mappings, unlike the failure example which contained an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` options are appropriately used to specify which video and audio streams to include in the output file. The syntax adheres to the rules outlined in the man page, where options are applied correctly to the specified input file.\n\n4) Since the output command fulfills the requirements of the task without syntax errors, invalid options, or conflicts with the FFmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation and does not contain the issue described."
