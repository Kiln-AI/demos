  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, use the `vstack` filter in ffmpeg. This filter places the first input on top and the second input below it. Make sure both videos have the same width and compatible pixel formats/durations to avoid issues. The command takes two inputs, stacks them vertically, and outputs `stacked.mp4` with H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -map 0:a? -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart stacked.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-filter_complex` with `vstack` stacks the two input videos vertically.\n- `[0:v][1:v]` selects the video streams from the first and second inputs.\n- `-map \"[v]\"` maps the stacked video output.\n- `-map 0:a?` maps the audio from the first input if it exists (optional).\n- Encoding parameters ensure broad compatibility and decent quality.\n- `-movflags +faststart` enables streaming compatibility.\n\nAssumption: Both videos have the same width; if not, resizing will be needed. Audio is taken only from the top video, but this can be adjusted if desired.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is well-structured, and it appears to meet the user's requirements for stacking two videos vertically. It specifies the use of the `vstack` filter, correctly maps the video streams, and includes appropriate encoding settings for both video and audio.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and utilizes valid options and parameters in accordance with the ffmpeg syntax. There are no obvious mistakes, such as using an invalid preset or option.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command adheres to the requirements outlined there. It applies options correctly to input and output files in the required order. The use of `-filter_complex`, `-map`, and encoding parameters (`-c:v`, `-c:a`, etc.) are appropriate and follow associated guidelines without any conflicts.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues, as it produces a command that is both functional and aligned with the userâ€™s request. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
