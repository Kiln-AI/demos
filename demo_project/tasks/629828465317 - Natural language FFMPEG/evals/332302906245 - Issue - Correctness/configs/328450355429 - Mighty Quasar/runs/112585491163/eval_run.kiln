  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode `video.webm` to MP4 using the fastest encoding preset, the command uses the `libx264` video codec (H.264) with the \"ultrafast\" preset, which is the fastest option in x264. While \"rocket\" is not a standard x264 preset, \"ultrafast\" matches the intent of prioritizing speed over compression efficiency. Audio is encoded as AAC, which is widely supported in MP4 containers.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- \"Rocket\" is likely a typo or misstatement; using \"ultrafast\" ensures maximum speed.  \n- No specific audio bitrate is required, so default AAC settings are used.  \n- The input file has a single audio stream; if not, additional parameters may be needed.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is valid and meets the user's requirement to transcode `video.webm` to MP4 format using the intended speed for encoding. The model correctly interpreted the request and provided an appropriate command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command it generates employs the valid preset `ultrafast` instead of using the non-existent `rocket`, thus it does not exhibit the same type of error as indicated in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the conventions regarding the ordering of options and uses valid options, such as `-c:v` for video codec and `-c:a` for audio codec.\n\n4) As the output accurately fulfills the user's request without violating any FFmpeg guidelines or generating errors, it should pass the evaluation. The model's response is valid and meets the need for a fast transcoding process while assuming \"rocket\" indicated speed, thus substituting \"ultrafast\" is a correct interpretation. Therefore, the command is effective for achieving the desired result."
