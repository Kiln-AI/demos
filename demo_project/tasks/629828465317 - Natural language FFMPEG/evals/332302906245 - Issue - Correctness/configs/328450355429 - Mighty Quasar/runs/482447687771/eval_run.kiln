  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To chain multiple filters in ffmpeg, you can use the filter_complex argument, applying each filter in order. \n\n- first the brightness filter, which shifts pixel values with `eq=brightness=VALUE` (VALUE is between -1 and 1; 0.1 is 10% brighter),\n- then the contrast filter, also with `eq=contrast=VALUE` (typical values 0.0 [black] to above 1 [higher contrast], default 1),\n- and finally the scale filter to resize the video to 1080p (height=1080) while keeping aspect ratio.\n\nFor example, let's increase brightness by 0.1 and contrast by 1.2.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file: input.mp4\n- Desired output: output.mp4\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\" chains the filters as requested.\n- scale=-2:1080 keeps the aspect ratio by fixing width to be divisible by 2.\n- -c:a copy copies audio without re-encoding.\n\nYou can adjust the brightness/contrast values accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command correctly applies the requested filters (brightness, contrast, and scaling) without syntax errors or incorrect parameters that would cause it to fail.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and does not involve an option or preset that does not exist, unlike the example which features the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-vf` followed by a chained filter string is correct, and the parameters specified (brightness, contrast, and scaling) fall within the valid options allowed by `ffmpeg`.\n\nOverall, the model's output correctly fulfills the user request with a properly structured command and appropriate assumptions. Thus, it does not contain issues as described."
