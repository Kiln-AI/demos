  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from the input file, use the `-map` option. The syntax is `-map input_file_index:stream_type_index`. The file index starts at 0, and stream indices are determined by the order of streams as reported by `ffmepg -i complex.avi`. I'm assuming there is only one input file. If there are multiple input files, adjust the file indices accordingly. Here, I'm mapping the second video stream (stream index 1) and the fourth audio stream (stream index 3).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 output.avi\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated command effectively maps the specified second video stream and fourth audio stream from `complex.avi`, which aligns with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The output command does not contain any invalid options or parameters; it correctly uses the `-map` option in the context of mapping input streams.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax used for the `-map` option and the command structure adheres to the guidelines, as well as the assumption of a single input file.\n\n4) Considering all the above evaluations, the model's output effectively fulfills the user's request without issues. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
