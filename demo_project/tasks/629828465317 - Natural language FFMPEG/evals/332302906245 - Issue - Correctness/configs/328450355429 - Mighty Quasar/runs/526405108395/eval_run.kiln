  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To stabilize shaky footage, apply color grading, and then perform geometric transformations like rotation and scaling in ffmpeg, you should carefully chain these filters in the correct order. \n\n1. **Stabilization**: Uses `deshake` filter (for ffmpeg versions 4.4 and later). It analyzes the video motion and compensates for it.\n2. **Color grading**: Apply via `colorchannelmixer`, `curves`, or `eq` filters depending on desired effect. Here, assume a simple contrast, brightness, and saturation adjustment with `eq`.\n3. **Geometric transformations**: combine rotation and scaling with `rotate`, `scale`, or a combined `transformscript` if needed. As ffmpeg doesn’t have a combined affine filter for arbitrary scale + rotate, use `transpose` (limited to 90 degree steps), or better, use `geq` or `transform` filters. But `transform` is not present in ffmpeg. So, use `rotate` + `scale` together or use `lensfun` or `frei0r` third-party filters for advanced. For simplicity, chain `rotate` and `scale`.\n\nRemember to adjust the order properly: stabilization → color correction → geometric transform. Also, use `-filter_complex` for multiple filters and scale to match output expectations.\n\n**Example command:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i shaky_input.mp4 -filter_complex \"\n  [0:v]deshake=w=1920:h=1080:lx=0:ly=0:dx=10:dy=5:rx=1:ry=1:edge=mirror,  # Stabilize\n  eq=contrast=1.1:brightness=0.02:saturation=1.1,                     # Color grading\n  format=yuv420p,                                                 # Ensure example compatibility\n  rotate=0.05*PI/180:amount=1,  # Rotate by 0.05 radians (~2.86 degrees)\n  scale=1280:720  # Scale to 720p\n  [vout]\" -map \"[vout]\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 20 -c:a copy stabilized_output.mp4\n```\n\n**Notes/Assumptions:**\n\n- Stabilization parameters (`dx`, `dy`, `rx`, `ry`) are placeholders—adjust based on your footage. `deshake` crops edges, so set output resolution appropriately.\n- Rotation is applied by 0.05 radians (about 2.86 deg); tweak as needed.\n- Color grading is minimal for illustration.\n- Scaling downs resolution to 1280x720, keep or modify as required.\n- Audios stream is copied without re-encoding.\n- Assumed input resolution (1920x1080); change `w` and `h` in `deshake` filters if different.\n- This constructs a `filter_complex` chain to minimize intermediate file usage.\n\nFor higher flexibility, optionally, you can split into multiple steps with intermediate outputs, but the above keeps it concise.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated does not properly consider the ordering of filters and does not utilize valid parameters or filter syntax. For instance, the stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations filters are chained together, but the syntax used for the `rotate` filter is incorrect, and the approach to chaining them may lead to confusion regarding the input/output streams within the `-filter_complex`.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example, as it does not reference a non-existent preset. However, it does have issues that could lead to failure during execution due to incorrect usage of filters.\n\n3) Yes, the command generated by the model breaks some requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Specifically:\n   - The model uses `rotate=0.05*PI/180:amount=1`, which is not valid syntax for the rotate filter in ffmpeg. The correct syntax does not allow for expressions like `0.05*PI/180`, and it should be in the form of degrees or radians directly.\n   - The model does not provide clear mapping of the output from the transformation chain to an output stream, which is essential in the usage of `-filter_complex`.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output contains critical issues regarding the command syntax that would likely lead to execution failures. Therefore, it should fail the evaluation based on the described issues."
