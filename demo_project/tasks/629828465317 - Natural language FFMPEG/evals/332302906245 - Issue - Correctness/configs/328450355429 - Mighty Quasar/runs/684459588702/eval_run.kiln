  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` with yellow text, use the `subtitles` video filter to overlay the SRT subtitles and specify the color via `force_style`. This ensures the subtitles are permanently embedded into the video frames. The `-c:a copy` flag preserves the original audio stream without re-encoding, while the `color=#FFFF00` hex code guarantees precise yellow text (though `color=yellow` might also work, hex codes are more reliable across systems).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -i subtitles.srt -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='color=#FFFF00'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The SRT file is in the same directory as the MKV file.\n- The output format remains MKV.\n- The original audio stream is acceptable without re-encoding.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Evaluation**: The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command is syntactically correct and matches the user's requirements to hardcode the subtitles into the video with a specified color.\n\n2) **Similarity to Failing Output**: The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated does not use an invalid option or preset, and it follows the correct syntax for adding subtitles.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: The command adheres to the ffmpeg man page directives. The options used (`-i` for input files, `-vf` for video filters, and `-c:a` to copy audio) are appropriate and follow the expected sequence. There are no violations regarding how options are applied to the specified files.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation**: The model's output does not contain issues described in the evaluation criteria; it produces a correct and functional ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation smoothly."
