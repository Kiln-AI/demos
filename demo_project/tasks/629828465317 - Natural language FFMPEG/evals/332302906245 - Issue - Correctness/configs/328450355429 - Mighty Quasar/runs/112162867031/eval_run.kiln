  "input": "I need to apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence to clean up an old video file.",
  "output": "To apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence, use the `-vf` option with a chain of filters. The order is important as it affects the final output. I'm assuming you have a baseline understanding of which specific filters you'd like to use, as there are many options for each of these categories, and that you'd like a generally lossless approach, for maximum control over later encoding.\n\n-   `hqdn3d` performs high-quality 3D denoise. You can adjust the strength of luma (l) and chroma (c) noise reduction. The defaults are generally good starting points.\n-   `colorbalance` adjusts the color balance. You can tweak red, green, and blue channel levels for shadows, midtones, and highlights. It will take some experimentation to find the correct value.\n-   `unsharp` sharpens the video. Adjust `lx` (luma strength) and `ly` (chroma strength).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf hqdn3d=luma_spatial=4:chroma_spatial=3:luma_temporal=6,colorbalance=rs=0.1:gs=-0.2:bs=0.1:rm=0.1:gm=-0.1:bm=0.1:rh=0.1:gh=-0.1:bh=0.1,unsharp=5:5:0.8:3:3:0.4 output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The modelâ€™s output does not contain an issue as described. The command provided seems logically structured and employs valid filters for noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening. All specified filters are recognized by ffmpeg, and the overall syntax appears correct. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command itself is valid and does not include any nonexistent parameters or incorrect filter names. There is no obvious incorrect syntax akin to the \"extra_fast\" preset example.\n\n3) There are no apparent violations of the ffmpeg man page requirements. Each option is applied appropriately: input and output files are specified correctly, and the filter chaining is done properly with the `-vf` option.\n\nOverall, the model's output is valid and should work as intended without breaking any ffmpeg requirements. Therefore, the evaluation result is that it passes the performance criteria."
