  "output": "To convert input.mp4 to an MKV container while using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset, we'll map the video stream from the input file and encode it with x265. We assume you want to maintain the original audio streams as is.\n\n- `-c:v libx265` specifies the x265 encoder for video.\n- `-preset veryslow` sets the x265 preset to veryslow, which focuses on achieving the best compression efficiency at the cost of slower encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio streams from the input file without re-encoding, which is efficient and preserves the original audio quality.\n- `-c:s copy` copies any subtitle streams from the input file without modification.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy -c:s copy output.mkv\n```\n\nNote: This command assumes that the input file has at least one video stream. If the input file has multiple video streams, all of them will be encoded using the x265 encoder. Also, if there are any subtitle streams, they will be copied as is.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command appears to align well with the user's request to convert `input.mp4` to MKV format using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copying the audio stream. \n\n2) The output provided by the model is not similar to the failure example given. The command given in the model's output is valid and does not contain any non-existent options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All specified parameters are correctly used, and the options follow the required syntax. The command effectively ensures that inputs and outputs are properly handled according to FFmpeg's guidelines.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass because it generates a correct and valid FFmpeg command that meets the user's request without breaking any requirements from the man page."
