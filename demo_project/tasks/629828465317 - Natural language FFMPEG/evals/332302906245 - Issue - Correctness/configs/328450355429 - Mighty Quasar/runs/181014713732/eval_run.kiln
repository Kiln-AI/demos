  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated is correct according to the parameters specified by the user. The user requested a transformation that specifically addressed video bitrate and web readiness, which the model fulfilled correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model does not contain any invalid arguments or non-existent options, such as a preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. The parameters used in the command comply with the correct option usage and order prescribed in the man page. The order of options and the codecs are appropriate as per the FFmpeg guidelines.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the evaluation steps, the model's output is deemed to correctly generate a command that meets the user's request without issues."
