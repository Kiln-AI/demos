  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To encode your video with a constant bitrate (CBR) of 25,000 kbps, set the video codec to libx264 and use the -b:v 25000k option. By default, -b:v enables Constant Bitrate mode. You should also set -maxrate and -bufsize for best CBR compliance, and make sure your pixel format is yuv420p for compatibility. For audio, you may choose an appropriate codec and bitrate (here using AAC at 128k as an example).\n\nHere's the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i your_input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k -preset veryfast -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_cbr.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of parameters:**\n- -b:v 25000k: Sets the target constant video bitrate to 25 Mbps.\n- -maxrate 25000k: Ensures the instantaneous bitrate doesnâ€™t exceed 25,000kbps.\n- -bufsize 50000k: Sets the video buffer size (usually 1 to 2 times your bitrate) for better bitrate control.\n- -preset veryfast: Controls encoding speed; adjust as needed.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures wide device compatibility.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: Encodes audio to AAC at 128kbps.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file is named your_input.mp4 (change as needed).\n- You want H.264 (libx264) video encoding in .mp4 output.\n- AAC audio is acceptable; change as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any apparent issues. The command is correctly structured and adheres to the user's request for a constant video bitrate of 25,000 kbps. Additionally, the parameters used in the command follow the appropriate format and usage according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid, whereas the provided failure example contains a non-existent preset option.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. Every option is valid and properly applied according to general ffmpeg usage conventions, and the order of options is appropriate for output specification.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description; therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
