  "output": "To extract a specific video stream (stream 10) and a specific audio stream (stream 18) from broadcast.ts and combine them, you can use the stream selection feature with the `-map` option in ffmpeg.\n\n- `-map 0:10` selects stream 10 from input 0 (your file).\n- `-map 0:18` selects stream 18 from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies the selected streams without re-encoding.\n\nThis assumes stream 10 is a video stream and stream 18 is an audio stream; if either is not, ffmpeg will give you an error.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy combined.ts\n```\n\nThis will create `combined.ts` containing only the desired video and audio streams, combined together, with no re-encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid for extracting specific streams from an input file and combining them, which matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated does not include any non-existent parameters or options, so it should work correctly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses the `-map` option correctly to select the specified video and audio streams, follows the syntax for input and output, and applies the `-c copy` option appropriately for copying the streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It accurately generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's request for extracting and combining specific video and audio streams from the input file. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
