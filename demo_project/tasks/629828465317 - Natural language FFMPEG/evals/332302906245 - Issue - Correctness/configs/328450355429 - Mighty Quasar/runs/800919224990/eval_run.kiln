  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract a specific video stream and audio stream from `broadcast.ts` and combine them into a single file, you can use the `-map` option to select the streams and the `-c:v` and `-c:a` options to define the video and audio codecs. For this example, I'll assume you want to use the default codecs that ffmpeg will use based on the stream index provided. The result is saved as `output.mp4`.\n\nI'll make the assumption that the extracted video and audio should be encoded using default profiles (h264 for video, aac for audio), and the output will maintain the original audio-only metadata like track information since we're combining them into one.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 10:0 -map 18:1 -c:v copy -c:a aac -strict experimental output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i broadcast.ts` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 10:0` selects video stream 10 as the video stream in the output, and the `:0` implies that we're using the default video codec.\n- `-map 18:1` selects audio stream 18 as the audio stream in the output, and the `:1` implies that we're using the default audio codec.\n- `-c:v copy` tells ffmpeg to copy the video codec as-is without re-encoding, preserving the original codecs (assumed to be h264).\n- `-c:a aac` sets the audio codec to AAC for encoding the extracted audio stream.\n- `-strict experimental` is sometimes necessary to enable experimental components in ffmpeg, such as using H.264 mov (not typically required, but good practice when working with streams).\n- `output.mp4` is the output combined video and audio file.\n\nThis command does not preserve any additional information like subtitles or track titles because we haven't specified how to handle them. If that's important, additional options would be required.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model appears to correctly extract the specified video and audio streams from the input file using the appropriate `-map` options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is correctly structured and uses valid options from the ffmpeg tool.\n\n3) The command generated in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` options is appropriate, and there are no syntax errors or invalid options. \n\nOverall, based on these evaluations, the model's output is correct and meets the user request."
