  "output": "To downscale your 4K video to 1080p (Full HD) and encode using H.264 with the highest quality/efficiency preset (veryslow), while copying the audio stream without re-encoding, use:\n\n- `-vf scale=-2:1080` scales the video to 1080 pixels high, preserving aspect ratio.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes video in H.264.\n- `-preset veryslow` gives the best compression at the cost of encoding speed.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio directly from the source (no re-encoding).\n- `-movflags +faststart` places metadata at the start for faster playback, which is helpful for web delivery.\n\nAssumption: Your source file is called `input.mp4` (replace with your actual filename).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\nYou can adjust `-crf` (Constant Rate Factor) for desired quality: lower values mean better quality but larger files (default 23 is a good balance).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate and matches the requirements from the user, as it correctly converts a 4K video to 1080p MP4 format while copying the audio stream without re-encoding it.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and correctly utilizes existing parameters such as the `veryslow` preset and `-c:a copy`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All the options used are valid and properly formatted based on the command syntax.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output does not contain any issues and successfully fulfills the task requirements, thus it should pass the evaluation."
