  "output": "To convert your video into both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file, we can use FFmpeg's ability to create multiple video streams within a single file. We'll also include an AAC audio stream for simplicity.\n\nHere's an explanation of the technique:\n\n*   We use the `-map` option to specify that all video and audio streams from the input file should be mapped into the output file.\n*   The `-c:v:0` option sets the codec for the first video stream (H.264), and `-c:v:1` sets the codec for the second video stream (H.265).\n*   The `-c:a` option sets the codec for the audio stream.\n\nHere's the FFmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0 -c:v:0 libx264 -c:v:1 libx265 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nNote that this command will create an MP4 file containing one audio stream and two video streams. The first video stream will be encoded using H.264, and the second video stream will be encoded using H.265. This is often used for adaptive bitrate streaming, where the client can choose the stream that best suits their network conditions.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n*   The input file is named `input.avi`.\n*   The output file will be named `output.mp4`.\n*   The video streams are to be encoded using the default presets for H.264 and H.265. You can add a `-preset` option before each codec to specify a custom preset (e.g., `-c:v:0 libx264 -preset slow`).\n*   The AAC audio codec is used for the audio stream with default settings. You can add additional audio options, such as bitrate or sample rate, as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is valid and accurately reflects the user's request to create a file with both H.264 and H.265 video streams.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command generated does not use an invalid preset or any incorrect options that would cause it to fundamentally fail. All specified options are valid concerning the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map 0` and codec specifications with `-c:v:0` and `-c:v:1` are appropriately used. The command meets the requirements laid out by the user regarding creating multiple video streams.\n\n4) Since the command is valid, accurately meets the user's request, and does not generate any errors, it passes the evaluation criteria."
