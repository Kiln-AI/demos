  "output": "To select specific streams (stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio) from a file with multiple tracks, you can use stream selection options in ffmpeg.\n\n- Use `-map 0:15` to select the 16th stream of the input (indexing starts at 0).\n- Use `-map 0:22` to select the 23rd stream of the input.\n- This approach ensures only those specific streams are included in the output.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to output those streams into a new file with the default container format or specify one if needed.\n- The source file `source.mkv` contains at least 23 streams and the specified ones are in correct order.\n\nHere's an example command that copies the selected streams without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf later you want to encode them to a different format or container, you can change `output.mkv` to `output.mp4` or re-encode as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly selects the specified streams from the input file and uses proper mapping (`-map`) options. The command also includes the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate given the user's request to select specific streams without indicating any transformation or re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model does not use any incorrect options or values; it only specifies valid stream mapping options that align with FFmpeg's syntax and requirements.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The stream mapping (`-map 0:15`, `-map 0:22`) follows the syntax outlined, and the copying of streams with `-c copy` is also in accordance with the guidelines. The output file format is not forced but is implicitly determined based on the file extension, which is acceptable.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
