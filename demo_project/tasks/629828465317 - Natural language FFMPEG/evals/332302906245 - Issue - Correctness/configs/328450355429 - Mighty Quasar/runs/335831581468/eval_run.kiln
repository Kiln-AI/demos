  "input": "Use my Nvidia GPU to speed up this conversion. Re-encode `gameplay.mkv` to `gameplay.mp4` with the NVENC encoder and a CRF of 20.",
  "output": "To use your Nvidia GPU for faster encoding with NVENC, you can use the `h264_nvenc` codec. However, note that NVENC doesn't support CRF mode the same way libx264 does; instead, it uses a constant rate factor through the `-cq` parameter (constant quality). Setting `-cq 20` gives you a similar quality level as CRF 20.\n\n- `-c:v h264_nvenc` selects the Nvidia NVENC H.264 encoder.\n- `-cq 20` controls the quality level (lower is better quality).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the original audio stream without re-encoding to save time.\n- Output container is mp4 for wide compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i gameplay.mkv -c:v h264_nvenc -cq 20 -c:a copy gameplay.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain any issues. The `ffmpeg` command it generated correctly utilizes the Nvidia GPU with the `h264_nvenc` codec, specifies the quality control parameter (`-cq`), and sets the audio to be copied without re-encoding. The command meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and uses valid options for `ffmpeg`, while the failing output example you provided contains a non-existent preset option.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command follows the requirements laid out in the `ffmpeg` man page. It includes the necessary input file (`-i gameplay.mkv`), specifies the video codec (`-c:v h264_nvenc`), uses the correct quality control parameter (`-cq 20`), and handles the audio with `-c:a copy` correctly.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It generates a correct `ffmpeg` command that aligns with the user's request and adheres to the constraints outlined in the man page. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
