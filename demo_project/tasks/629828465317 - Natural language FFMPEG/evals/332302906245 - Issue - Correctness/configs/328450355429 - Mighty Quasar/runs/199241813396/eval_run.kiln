  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo stack two videos vertically, the best approach is to use the `vstack` filter in FFmpeg. This filter places the input videos on top of each other, aligning them vertically. The resulting output will have a height equal to the sum of the input heights (assuming they have the same width), which is normally the case for stacking videos. If widths differ, you may need to scale or pad to match; I assume the videos have compatible dimensions in this case.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n- Use the `vstack=inputs=2` filter to stack the two input videos.\n- Wrap the two video inputs in quotes and pass them as a list to the filter inputs.\n- If the aspect ratio or dimensions differ, you may need to scale or crop, but for now, I assume the videos have the same width for efficient stacking and compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy stacked.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\"` combines top and bottom video streams.\n- `-map \"[v]\"` maps the output from the filter to the video stream in the output.\n- Audio is copied without changes (`-c:a copy`) assuming both videos have identical audio to avoid issues.\n- video codec is H.264 (`-c:v libx264`) for broad compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command looks correct for the task of stacking two videos vertically using the `vstack` filter, and it matches the user's requirements of placing `top_video.mp4` over `bottom_video.mp4` and saving it as `stacked.mp4`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command produced by the model is valid and uses established parameters and options correctly, unlike the example which included a non-existent preset option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used, such as `-filter_complex`, `-map`, and codec settings, are all accurate according to the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully generated a valid command for the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
