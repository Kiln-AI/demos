  "output": "To convert input.mov to MP4 using the H.265 (HEVC) codec, you can use libx265 with the slowest (super_slow) preset to maximize compression efficiency. Note that H.265 is not as widely compatible as H.264, but offers better compression at the cost of encoding speed.\n\n- -c:v libx265 selects the H.265 codec.\n- -preset super_slow uses the slowest preset for the best compression ratio (but longest encoding time).\n- -c:a aac encodes the audio using the compatible AAC codec for the MP4 container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -preset super_slow -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: No specific bitrate or quality setting was requested; libx265 defaults to CRF 28, which is suitable for many uses. Add -crf <value> (e.g., -crf 28) if you want to control quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model uses valid options and adheres to the user request of converting `input.mov` to MP4 with H.265 encoding using the `super_slow` preset.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output because the command does not contain erroneous preset options or invalid syntax. The preset `super_slow` is a valid option for H.265.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly specifies the input file, the codec, the preset, and the audio codec. It follows the expected syntax and structure of an `ffmpeg` command.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes the evaluation. The command is functional and matches the user's request accurately."
