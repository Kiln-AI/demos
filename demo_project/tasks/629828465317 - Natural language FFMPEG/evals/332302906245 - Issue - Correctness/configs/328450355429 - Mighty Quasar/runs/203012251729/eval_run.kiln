  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To convert a video file for web use with a specified video bitrate, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs (widely supported), set the video bitrate to 50 Mbps, enable fragmented MP4 for streaming, and maintain compatibility with various browsers/devices.\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding.\n- bitrate 50000k sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps. Note that the overall file bitrate may be higher due to the audio bitrate as well.\n- c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps.\n- pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility with older browsers/devices.\n- movflags +faststart places metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n\nAssumptions made: The input file has an extension (omit if different) and that you are using AAC for audio. I also assume a fixed 128 kbps bitrate for AAC audio might be considered low, higher bitrates can be chosen for better quality. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf your input file has extension avi (mentioned in the prompt which followed the example), I would modify the above to\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated command correctly sets a specific video bitrate and outputs it as an MP4 file suitable for web use. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output shown in the <failure_example>. The command does not contain any non-existent options like `-preset extra_fast`, which would cause it to fail. The options used in the generated command are valid and match ffmpeg's command line syntax.\n\n3) The command generated by the model complies with the requirements dictated in the man page. The options used are properly structured according to the syntax for ffmpeg commands. The bitrate is set using the correct `-b:v` option, and there are no conflicting or erroneous parameters present.\n\n4) Given these evaluations, the model's output passes all checks and does not contain any issues. The provided command functions correctly as per the requirements while adhering to ffmpeg's guidelines."
