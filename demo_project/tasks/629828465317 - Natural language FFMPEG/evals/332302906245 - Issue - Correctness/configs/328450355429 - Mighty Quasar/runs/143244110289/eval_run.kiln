  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in a specific order using `ffmpeg`, you can use the `filter_complex` option with a filter chain. The filters should be specified in the order you want them applied: first temporal noise reduction, then spatial denoising, and finally edge enhancement.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You are using `ffmpeg` version 4.0 or later, which supports the `filter_complex` syntax.\n- You have the necessary filters installed (e.g., `noise`, `hqdn3d`, `unsharp`).\n- You are working with a video file and want to apply these filters to the video stream only.\n\nHereâ€™s the correct filter chain syntax:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"noise=t=0.1:noise=0.001, hqdn3d, unsharp\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `noise=t=0.1:noise=0.001`: Applies temporal noise reduction with a threshold of 0.1 and noise factor of 0.001.\n- `hqdn3d`: Applies spatial denoising (High Quality Denoise 3D).\n- `unsharp`: Enhances edges, providing sharpness to the video.\n\nNote: You can adjust the parameters of each filter based on your specific needs and the content of your video.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated appears syntactically correct for applying the specified filters in the right order and does not present any obvious errors that would render it non-functional.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model does not contain invalid or non-existent options; it uses valid filter names and parameters that are supported in FFmpeg, which means it should work unless there are issues with the specific filters being installed.\n\n3) The command does **not break any requirements dictated in the man page.** All parameters used in the command are valid and correctly formatted for what was requested. Each filter is properly applied in sequence using the `-vf` option, and the syntax adheres to the general rules laid out in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output should **pass**, as it generates a valid FFmpeg command that meets the user's requirements while adhering to the specifications outlined in the FFmpeg man page."
