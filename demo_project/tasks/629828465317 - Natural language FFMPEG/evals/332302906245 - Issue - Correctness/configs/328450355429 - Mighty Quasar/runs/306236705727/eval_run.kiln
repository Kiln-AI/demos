  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To convert a vertical video like `story.mov` into a 16:9 widescreen format by adding blurred bars on the left and right sides, use the `boxblur` filter combined with `concat` and `pad` filters. The `boxblur` filter creates a blurred area, and `concat` creates a new frame by duplicating the video onto the blank sides. `pad` then expands this video to fit the full 16:9 size without stretching or distorting the original content.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- `boxblur` for background (left and right sides).\n- `scale` and `pad` transformations prepare the output in 16:9 aspect ratio.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for encoding and compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` for web streaming.\n\nAssuming you want full width for the main video area (width = height * 16/9), and 10px \"bars\" added on each side of 10px width, and 4px \"bars\" added horizontally with blur effect:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \\\n\"boxblur=10:10:(i w-16):i h \\\n(concat=ih:w' pad=iw:*:(i w-20):i*h:color.Prpl[seq1]; \\\nsqrscale=iw*7/9:y='ih*4/9:-1:flags=lanczos,split=2 \\\n[sqrscaled_0[v0],sqrscaled_0[seq1]] \\\n-boxblur=10:10:10:(iw-16):ih[seq2]\" \\\n-filter_complex \"[seq1][seq2]hstack[n1][n1]\" -map 0:v -map -:format yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_wide.mp4\n```\n\nBut first, we need to combine and filter correctly to avoid filters conflicts and match all streams.\n\nThe full solution:\n\n1. Blend vertical video on the center, horizontal blurred fill on both sides.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- First segment: Box blur on left and right sides and blend input video on right side.\n- Second: Pad input on left and right with the composited video to fill width.\n- `:flags=lanczos` ensures smooth blur.\n- Final map removes overlapping filter outputs.\n- `format yuv420p` for max compatibility.\n\nThis will produce a standard 16:9 widescreen video with blurred bars on the sides and the main vertical video content in the center.\n\n### Final command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \\\n\"[0:v]boxblur=10:-1:start_h:Main_Fl; \\\n[0:v]boxblur=10:-1:start_h:0:width -1[v2]; \\\n[0:v][v2]hstack,format=yuv420p\" -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_wide.mp4\n```\n\n# Explanation:\n\n- `[0:v]boxblur=10:-1:start_h:Main_Fl` applies box blur horizontally starting from video height center and spanning full width.\n- `[0:v]boxblur=10:-1:start_h:0:width -1` applies same blur on right side, with starting height as input height and width as output width.\n- Then `hstack` merge left (`Main_Fl`) and right (`v2`) blurred regions.\n- Final map `0:a` includes the audio stream as is.\n- Encoded video (`-c:v libx264`) and uses `yuv420p` for maximum compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` for progressive streaming.\n\n---\n\nThis assumes that your input video does not need to be scaled up or down in height. If you want to adjust the width of the blurred boxes or fit another exact width, adjust the `boxblur` parameters and padding accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output contains significant flaws both in the explanation of the technique/parameters and the generated ffmpeg command itself. The provided command is very convoluted and contains multiple errors and inconsistencies that prevent it from functioning correctly. For instance, there are typos and misplaced syntax. Thus, the output does contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nYes, the output generated by the model is similar to the failure example mentioned. The command appears to be overly complicated and incorrect, potentially leading to failure in execution, similar to how a nonsensical command like `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` would fail due to an incorrect preset. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, the command breaks multiple requirements based on the ffmpeg man page. The syntax and order of filters used are incorrect, such as the improper usage of `boxblur` and the concatenation method. Additionally, the command includes erroneous references to undefined label names and incorrect filter parameters. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the output fails to meet the requirements by generating an incorrect ffmpeg command that would not execute successfully, thus confirming that it contains the issue described."
