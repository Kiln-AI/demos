  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to map specific streams from their source.mkv file into a new edited.mp4. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they mentioned video from stream 0:3 and audio from 0:5. In ffmpeg, streams are identified with [stream specifier syntax][1], so mapping them would require using the -map option. The streams are in the same file, so the input is source.mkv. \n\nThe output format is mp4, which is container format that commonly uses H.264 and AAC. They didn't specify any codec changes, so I should just copy the streams if possible. But wait, in some cases, specific codecs might not be supported in mp4, like if the video is not H.264 or audio not AAC. However, since the user hasn't asked for re-encoding, the safest approach is to use -c copy to copy the streams as is. \n\nWait, but if the original streams are in a codec not compatible with mp4, ffmpeg might not allow the copy. For example, if the video is a different codec than H.264, the output file might not play correctly in an mp4 container. But without more info, the user might just want to repackage those streams without re-encoding. \n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n1. Use -map options to select the streams. \n   - -map 0:v:3 for video stream 3 (since 0:3 is video stream 3 from input 0).\n   - -map 0:a:5 for audio stream 5.\n2. Copy the streams with -c copy to avoid re-encoding.\n3. Output to edited.mp4.\n\nBut wait, ffmpeg's stream specifiers. The correct syntax for mappings would be -map 0:3 and -map 0:5. The 0:3 refers to input 0 (source.mkv) stream index 3. So in the command, the -map options would be:\n\n-map 0:3 -map 0:5.\n\nThen, specifying codec copy for both video and audio, or just -c:v copy -c:a copy, which will copy the selected streams.\n\nSo the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n\nThis copies the streams as-is. But if the codecs are incompatible with mp4, this might give an error. However, on the user's input, since they only want to map the streams, this should be the way. If the codecs are not compatible, the user would need to specify codecs, but based on the query, the user hasn't mentioned that, so I should proceed with -c copy.\n\nSo the final command is as above. Need to make sure the order of the -map options is video then audio. Also, the output stream order in mp4 is the two streams copied. \n\nAssuming that the streams 0:3 and 0:5 are video and audio, respectively, which the user said. The -c copy might cause errors if codecs are not compatible, but without more info from user, proceed with that.\n</think>\n\nTo extract video stream 0:3 and audio stream 0:5 from source.mkv and remux them into a new mp4 file without re-encoding, use `-map` to explicitly select streams and `-c copy` to copy them as-is. This preserves quality and processing speed. MP4 compatibility depends on the original codec(s), but this is the most straightforward approach.\n\n- `-map 0:3` includes video stream 0:3.\n- `-map 0:5` includes audio stream 0:5.\n- `-c copy` avoids re-encoding for speed/quality.\n- Assumes the video/audio streams are compatible with the MP4 container (e.g., H.264/H.265 for video, AAC for audio). If not, re-encoding would be required.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\n[1] https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-specifiers",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams using the `-map` option and utilizes `-c copy` to copy the streams as they are. This aligns with the user's request without any unnecessary alterations or errors in the command syntax. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it generated is syntactically correct and does not include any invalid options, unlike the failing example which used a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses valid options (`-map`, `-i`, and `-c copy`) and follows the correct syntax and order of options when specifying inputs and outputs. Since `-c copy` is commonly used and valid for preserving existing stream codecs when they are compatible with the MP4 container, there are no issues in this regard.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe output should pass, as it does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model is appropriate and adheres to the specifications for the task at hand."
