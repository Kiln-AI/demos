  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. Stream indexing in ffmpeg starts at 0, so the 7th video stream is index 6 and the 14th audio stream is index 13.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (index 6) from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream (index 13) from input 0\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest option, maintains original quality)\n\nI'm assuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding. If you need specific codecs or quality settings, those can be added.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated (using `-map` to select streams and `-c copy` for fast copying) correctly follows the user's request to map specific video and audio streams. The command also correctly identifies the indices for the streams that the user wants to map.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is valid and adheres to the functions of FFmpeg. It does not use any incorrect parameters or options like the example output provided.\n\n3) The command from the model adheres to the requirements stipulated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify input streams, and the order of parameters is correct as per the guidelines. \n\nGiven that the model's output is accurate, follows the user request, and does not contain any invalid commands or parameters, I would conclude that the output is correct and effective. The model performs well on this task."
