  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from video.mp4 and encode it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset, you should set -compression_level 9 with the FLAC codec. The FLAC codec supports compression levels from 0 (fastest, least compression) to 9 (slowest, most compression). Using -compression_level 9 optimizes storage and quality, though encoding will be slower.\n\nThis command just copies the audio stream, re-encoding it to FLAC at level 9, and preserves all original metadata.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a flac -compression_level 9 -y audio.flac\n```\n\nAssumption: video.mp4 contains an audio stream that you want to save as lossless FLAC at the highest compression level.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be correctly formulated, and it extracts audio from the specified video file and encodes it as a FLAC file using the specified maximum compression level. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not include any non-existent presets or options; instead, it uses valid options for FFmpeg, particularly with the FLAC codec.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The `-c:a flac` and `-compression_level 9` options are valid and correctly used. The command follows the required syntax and structures outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output passes all criteria set for performance on this task. The command generated is valid, follows the user's request accurately, and adheres to the FFmpeg specifications. Therefore, the output should be considered successful."
