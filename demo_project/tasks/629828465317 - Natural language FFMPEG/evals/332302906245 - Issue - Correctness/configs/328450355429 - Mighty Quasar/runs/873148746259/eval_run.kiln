  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract only the video and the 5th **audio** track, map streams 0:v (video from file 0) and 0:a:4 (fifth audio track—remember the index starts at 0) while dropping everything else.  \n- `-map 0:v` takes *all* video stream(s).  \n- `-map 0:a:4` chooses the 5th audio track (index 4).  \n- `-c copy` disables re-encoding to avoid quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:4 -c copy output.mov\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is appropriate for the user's request, and it correctly maps the video and the specified audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model utilizes valid options and correctly maps the streams, so it doesn’t exhibit any incorrect syntactic elements like an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (-map and -c copy) are valid and do not conflict with the expected input-output mapping or any general rules regarding options order or syntax.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct, as it meets the user's requirements and adheres to the correct usage of ffmpeg command line parameters. Therefore, the evaluation passes."
