  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To reduce the file size of `video.mp4` without changing the resolution, use efficient H.264 compression with a higher CRF (lower quality, smaller size) and reduce the audio bitrate. This approach prioritizes speed and compatibility while minimizing output size.\n\n- **`-crf 32`**: Lower quality (higher compression) for smaller file size. CRF values above 23 reduce quality; use this if visual precision isn't critical.\n- **`-preset fast`**: Balances speed and compression efficiency.\n- **`-b:a 64k`**: Halves the audio bitrate from a common default (128kbps) to cut file size further.\n- Assumes the original video uses H.264 (common in MP4 files). If not, consider re-encoding with `-c:v libx264` twice for max reduction.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -crf 32 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 64k smaller_video.mp4\n```\n\n---  \n**Alternative with resolution reduction (720p):**  \nIf drastic size reduction is needed, downscale the video instead of increasing CRF to avoid severe quality drops:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf \"scale=-2:720\" -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k smaller_video.mp4\n```\n\nLet me know if the file is unusually large (e.g., 4K input) and further optimization (e.g., `-b:v` video bitrate limits) may be needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appears to be correct and fulfills the user's request to reduce the file size of the video without changing resolution. The use of `-crf 32` and `-b:a 64k` is reasonable for achieving a smaller file size.\n\n2) The modelâ€™s output is not similar to the failure example, as there is no indication of a nonexistent preset or command option. The parameters used in the command (`-crf`, `-preset`, `-b:a`) are valid and appropriate for the desired media transformation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used in the command line are valid and correctly ordered with respect to the output specification. The options `-crf`, `-preset`, and `-b:a` are all valid under the general usage of ffmpeg, as outlined.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue as it correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
