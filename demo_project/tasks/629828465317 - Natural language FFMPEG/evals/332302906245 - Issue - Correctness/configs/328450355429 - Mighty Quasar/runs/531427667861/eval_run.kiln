  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a media file, you can use the `-map` option which allows you to pick particular streams by their index. Here, you want video stream 12 and audio stream 25 (note that ffmpeg stream indices start at 0, so these are zero-based indices).\n\nThe command will copy these streams without re-encoding by using `-c copy`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i recording.mkv`: input file\n- `-map 0:v:12`: select the 13th video stream (index 12) from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:25`: select the 26th audio stream (index 25) from input 0\n- `-c copy`: copy streams without re-encoding\n- `output.mkv`: output file with the selected streams\n\nAssumption: Your file has at least 13 video streams and 26 audio streams. If stream numbers are global counting across all streams, or not separated by type, you may need to identify streams differently.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   The model's output does not contain an issue related to the command's correctness or functionality. The command produced is coherent and correctly uses `-map` to select specific video and audio streams based on the indices provided by the user. It appears to be appropriate for the task described. Therefore, it passes this evaluation step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated does not contain any invalid options or parameters; it correctly implements the `-map` option and syntax required by `ffmpeg`. Thus, it does not constitute a failing output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-map` for selecting specific streams and the `-c copy` option for copying these streams without re-encoding is appropriate and completely aligns with the man page guidelines.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   The model's output does not contain any issues, aligns well with the task requirements, and adheres to the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it passes all evaluation steps confidently."
