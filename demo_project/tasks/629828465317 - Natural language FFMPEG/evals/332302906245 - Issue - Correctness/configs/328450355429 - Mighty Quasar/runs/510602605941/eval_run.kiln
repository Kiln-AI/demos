  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert your video to MP4 with a target bitrate of 5000 kb/s using VBR (Variable Bitrate), you can use the `-b:v` option to set the target bitrate and `-maxrate` along with `-minrate` to control the bitrate range, allowing some variability but generally locking around 5000 kb/s. The `-bufsize` helps control the variability buffer. This approach keeps the bitrate close to 5000 kb/s while still leveraging VBR benefits.\n\nHere is the command assuming a standard H.264 codec:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -minrate 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 1000k -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264.  \n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the target bitrate to 5000 kb/s.  \n- `-minrate 5000k` and `-maxrate 5000k` force the bitrate to stay around 5000 kb/s, effectively locking it.  \n- `-bufsize 1000k` defines the decoder buffer for bitrate control.  \n- `-c:a aac` converts the audio to AAC (common in MP4).  \n\nIf you want pure constant bitrate (CBR), you could add `-x264-params \"nal-hrd=cbr\"` for libx264, but here we stick with tightly controlled VBR as requested.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output successfully generates an `ffmpeg` command that appears to match the requirements specified by the user. The user requested a transformation into MP4 format while locking the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting, and the model's command effectively sets a target bitrate and specifies parameters (`-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`) to control variability. No apparent issues were identified in the command.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. The command produced is syntactically correct, and all the specified options are valid and applicable according to the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the given `ffmpeg` man page. All options used (`-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`) adhere to the allowed parameters for an `ffmpeg` command. The bit rate controls and codec specifications behave as expected.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model adheres to the requirements and produces valid syntax without errors, it passes the evaluation. The model successfully addressed the user's request with no detected issues related to the command or output."
