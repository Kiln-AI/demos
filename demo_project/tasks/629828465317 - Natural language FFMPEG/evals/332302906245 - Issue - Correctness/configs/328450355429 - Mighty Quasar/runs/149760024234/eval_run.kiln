  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. Here, `-map 0:4` selects the video stream at index 4 of input 0, and `-map 0:9` selects the audio stream at index 9 of input 0. The container format `.mp4` typically prefers H.264 video and AAC audio, so if the streams are not already in these formats, transcoding might be necessary. If you're sure the streams are compatible, you can use the copy codec to avoid re-encoding.\n\nAssuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to forcibly re-encode to ensure compatibility (H.264 video and AAC audio):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nLet me know if you want me to provide the command specifically with or without re-encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file and provides a valid command format for ffmpeg. Both provided commands (copying and re-encoding) are syntactically correct and follow the expected usage of ffmpeg.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The provided commands do not contain any non-existent options or incorrect syntax like the example with an invalid preset. Both commands are properly structured and would function as intended.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The commands provided in the output adhere to the requirements stated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` to select specific streams is correct and follows the rules regarding how options are applied to input and output files. There are no violations of the syntax or semantics as per the man page, and the output file is specified correctly after the options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Since the model's output does not contain any mistakes and aligns well with the requirements, I would classify this as passing the evaluation. The command generated meets the user's request effectively without any issues. Thus, it should pass as it does not contain the described issue."
