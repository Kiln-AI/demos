  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize your shaky video using the `deshake` filter, ffmpeg will analyze the motion between frames and apply corrections to reduce camera shake. The deshake filter is a simple single-pass stabilization method that works well for moderate shake.\n\nThe deshake filter uses these default parameters:\n- Analyzes motion vectors between frames\n- Applies smoothing to reduce sudden movements\n- Maintains the original video resolution and format\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake bumpy_ride_stabilized.mp4\n```\n\nNote: For more advanced stabilization with better results, you might consider using the `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` filters (two-pass method), but the single-pass `deshake` filter is simpler and often sufficient for basic stabilization needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command uses the `deshake` filter correctly for stabilizing the video, and it matches the user's requirement without any apparent errors.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The model's command is structured correctly and does not contain any invalid options or parameters.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command `ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake bumpy_ride_stabilized.mp4` does not break any requirements from the man page. It correctly specifies the input file, applies the `deshake` filter with the appropriate syntax, and designates the output file.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output successfully meets the user's request without any issues. Therefore, it can be concluded that the model performed well in generating a valid `ffmpeg` command based on the requirements provided by the user. The evaluation result is a pass."
