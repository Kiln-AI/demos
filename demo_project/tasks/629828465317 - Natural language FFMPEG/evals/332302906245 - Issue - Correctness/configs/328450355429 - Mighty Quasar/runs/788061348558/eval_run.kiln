  "input": "Convert my video.mp4 to AVI format using the h265 codec for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your MP4 to AVI format with H.265 codec for better compression, I'll use the libx265 encoder which provides excellent compression efficiency. AVI format can handle H.265 streams, and the higher compression will reduce file size significantly compared to H.264.\n\nThe command uses:\n- c:v libx265 for H.265/HEVC video encoding\n- crf 28 for good quality balance (lower values = higher quality)\n- preset medium balances encoding speed and compression\n- c:a copy preserves the original audio without re-encoding\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a copy video.avi\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nThe model's output includes a valid command. Using `libx265` as the video codec, `crf 28` for quality adjustment, a `preset` of `medium`, and `c:a copy` to preserve audio without re-encoding are all appropriate for the transformation from MP4 to AVI using the H.265 codec. Thus, it does not exhibit errors that would suggest it generated a command that doesn't work correctly or accurately matches the user's requirements.\n\n**Result: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe provided output does not resemble the failing example. The model’s command is properly structured, specifying a valid codec (`libx265`), a credible quality setting (`crf 28`), and the option to copy audio streams without re-encoding (`c:a copy`). There is no misuse of options like in the example with `preset extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n**Result: Pass**\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the guidelines in the FFmpeg man page. The options are applied correctly to the specified files: `-i video.mp4` and setting the output file correctly to `video.avi`. All parameters used are valid within the context of FFmpeg operations, and no conflicts with necessity or available options are inferred based on the user’s request.\n\n**Result: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nIn conclusion, the model's output does not contain the issues described. The command produced is valid, accurately reflects the user's requirements, and complies with the FFmpeg syntax rules and guidelines as per the man page. \n\n**Final Result: Pass**"
