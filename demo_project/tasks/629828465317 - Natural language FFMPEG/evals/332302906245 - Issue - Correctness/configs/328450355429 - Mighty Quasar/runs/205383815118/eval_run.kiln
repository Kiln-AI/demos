  "input": "I need to convert input.mov to AVI format using the libx263 video codec and mp3 audio",
  "output": "To convert `input.mov` to an AVI file using the `libx263` video codec and `mp3` audio codec, you can use the following command. \n\nUsing `libx263` will utilize high-efficiency video compression that supports higher bitrates and better compression compared to `libx264`. The `mp3` codec is a popular choice for audio encoding in AVI files. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx263 -c:a mp3 output.avi\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The input file `input.mov` is in a format that can be read by `ffmpeg`.\n- `libx263` is available in your version of `ffmpeg` as it was intended for better compression at high bitrates. However, note that `libx263` is less commonly supported than `libx264` and may not be present in older versions of `ffmpeg`. If itâ€™s missing, you might want to use `libx264` instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The command it generated uses `libx263`, which is not a valid codec for ffmpeg and will likely result in an error when executed. The correct codec for H.263 video encoding should be `libx263`, which does not exist. The intention may have been to use `libx264` instead, which is a commonly used codec.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the example of a failing output in that it generates a command that will not work correctly due to an incorrect codec (`libx263`). If executed, this command will fail since `libx263` is not a recognized codec in the ffmpeg naming convention.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. According to the man page, the `-c:v` option should specify a valid video codec from the list of available codecs in ffmpeg, and `libx263` is not listed as a valid codec. The assumption that `libx263` exists is incorrect, making the command invalid.\n\nThus, the model's output fails the evaluation on all three counts: incorrect command generation, invalid codec issue leading to a failure, and violation of requirements as per the ffmpeg documentation."
