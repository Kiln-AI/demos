  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, we will use the `drawtext` filter. This filter allows us to draw text on the video.\n\nWe assume both video files are in MP4 format, and the `top_video.mp4` is smaller than the `bottom_video.mp4`.\n\n-drawtext overlays the text on the image. We use a white color for a better visibility, but you can replace it with any other color to get the desired result.\n- in this case, left=200 and x. Since drawtext will take center from the specified left, to place the text above, you can add -x along with left value (e.g., left=200-x)\n-y position adjustment is also necessary -x0 for starting (top), +1y is good to begin.\nWe adjust the size and position of the text, thus setting center alignment center, and position position to be at the bottom of height.\n-r10 adjusts white text brightness a bit, just change to better.\n-y=1 creates space between both video, just set as desired.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex drawtext=text='video1' color='white' fontface=Bold fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=200:r=10:y=1,x pos=200-x+w-10:y topVideoOffset=0 -filter_complex drawtext=drawtext=text='video2' color='white' fontface=Bold fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=200:r=10:y=1-x3 +y 20:x=650 -filter_complex drawtext=text='stacked' color='white' fontface=Bold fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=1500:r=10:y=1 -map 0:v:0 -map 1:v:0 -map [v0] -map [v1] -c:v libx264 -r 24 -crf 18 -g 24 -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nYes, the model's output contains multiple issues in its generated command. It incorrectly uses the `drawtext` filter for stacking videos, which is not appropriate for this task. The command should instead utilize the `overlay` filter to stack the videos vertically, as `drawtext` is used to add text overlays rather than manipulate video streams. This means the command would not work correctly for the user's request to stack videos, violating the output requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the simple failing example provided. However, it is complex and may still end up not functioning correctly due to the issues present in the filtering command. In this case, it does not seem to follow logical steps related to stacking the two videos properly.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command is breaking several requirements. For instance, it unnecessarily uses multiple `-filter_complex` flags and incorrectly employs the `drawtext` filter instead of the necessary `overlay` filter. The stacking of videos is not executed correctly, which would likely lead to an error during execution. Additionally, commands like `-map` are not properly set up to select the right input streams or handle output structure, which is essential for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, it fails because the command generated does not meet the user's request for stacking two videos vertically. The overall incorrect use of filters and numerous mistakes in command syntax suggest a lack of correctness in handling the requirements laid out by the user. Therefore, it does indeed contain the issue as described."
