  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo create a new MP4 file (edited.mp4) by mapping video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of your source.mkv, you can directly stream copy (copy) these streams without re-encoding for efficiency and quality. It assumes that the source streams have codecs compatible with MP4, or at least that ffmpeg can remux them without transcoding (e.g., if MP4 container does not support those codecs, you may need to transcode). For safe MP4 output, you can remux by transcoding if needed, but for the general case of selecting and mapping specific streams for output, here is the ffmpeg command to do so.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:3` selects the video stream from track 3 of the first file (source.mkv).\n- `-map 0:5` selects the audio stream from track 5 of the same file.\n- `-c copy` copies those streams into the output file without re-encoding, preserving quality and saving time.\n\nIf ffmpeg complains or the file is not playable in output, and you need to transcode, let me know.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated by the model accurately uses the `-map` option to select video and audio streams from the input file and uses `-c copy` to copy those streams without re-encoding, which is efficient and maintains quality. The command syntax is correct and suits the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. There is no syntax error or invalid parameter in the command. The command structure follows the ffmpeg conventions properly and does not introduce any nonexistent options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` and `-c copy` options are correctly used in the appropriate context, following the guidelines provided in the man page for stream mapping and copying data.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation. The command is correctly formulated based on the user input."
