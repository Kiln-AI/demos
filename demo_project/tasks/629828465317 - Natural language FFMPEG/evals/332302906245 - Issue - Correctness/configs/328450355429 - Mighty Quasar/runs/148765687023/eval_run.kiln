  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from your input file, use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. `-map 0:6` selects the 7th video stream (streams are zero-indexed), and `-map 0:13` selects the 14th audio stream. I am assuming that the streams you refer to are indeed video and audio streams, and not other kinds of streams (like subtitles or data streams).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:6 -map 0:13 -c copy output.mov\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The provided command appears to correctly map the specified video and audio streams from the input file to create the output file. The mappings of `-map 0:6` for the 7th video stream and `-map 0:13` for the 14th audio stream are appropriate and correctly implemented.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output in the <failure_example>. The command provided does not contain any erroneous or non-existent options. There are no invalid presets or incorrectly named codecs; thus, it should function correctly according to the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The command uses the `-map` option correctly and follows the syntax outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering all of the above, I would conclude that the model's output does not contain the issue described and it should pass the evaluation."
