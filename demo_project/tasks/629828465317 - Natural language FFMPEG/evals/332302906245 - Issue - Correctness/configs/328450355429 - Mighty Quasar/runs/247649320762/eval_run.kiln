  "input": "Transcode my 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the turbo preset for fast processing",
  "output": "To transcode your 4K video to 1080p MP4 quickly, use the H.264 video codec with the turbo preset, which prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency.\n\n- `-s 1920x1080` sets the resolution to 1080p.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding, widely supported by most devices and browsers.\n- `-preset turbo` focuses on speed, making the encoding process faster but the output file larger compared to slower presets.\n- `-c:a aac` encodes audio using AAC, a widely supported audio codec.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older devices and browsers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -s 1920x1080 -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made: \n- Input file is named `input.mp4` and it's in the same directory as the ffmpeg command prompt.\n- The audio from the input file is sufficient in terms of quality and doesn't need a specific bitrate or quality adjustment.\n- The output file is to be named `output.mp4`, also in the same directory as the ffmpeg command prompt.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described in the <issue_description>?  \n**Pass**: The output correctly generates an ffmpeg command that matches the user's request to transcode a 4K video to 1080p MP4, using the turbo preset for fast processing. \n\n2) Is the model's output similar to the <failure_example>?  \n**Pass**: No, the output does not resemble the failure example. The preset \"turbo\" is valid, and all options used in the generated command are valid according to ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?  \n**Pass**: The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used in the command are valid.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?  \n**Pass**: The output does not contain any issues. It correctly defines the command to transcode the video to the user's specifications without any mistakes."
