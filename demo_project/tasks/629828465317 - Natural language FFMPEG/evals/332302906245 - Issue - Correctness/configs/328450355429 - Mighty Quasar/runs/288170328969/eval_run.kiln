  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using ffmpeg's `deshake` filter, you typically specify the input, set the filter with appropriate parameters if needed, and output the stabilized video. The `deshake` filter can be applied with default parameters for general stabilization, or customized for specific shaking patterns.\n\nAssuming you want a straightforward stabilization with default settings, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake\" -c:a copy stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4\n```\n\nThis command copies the original audio stream (-c:a copy) to avoid re-encoding, applies the `deshake` filter to the video, and saves the output as `stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4`. If you experience suboptimal results, parameters such as `x` and `y` for maximum translation might be adjusted accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described. It generates a command that works correctly and matches the requirements from the user. The output accurately applies the `deshake` filter to stabilize the video, uses the correct input file name, and correctly outputs the stabilized file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model uses valid parameters and does not contain any mistakes akin to incorrect option usages or invalid preset names. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses the `-vf` option for applying the video filter correctly, applies the `deshake` filter as specified, copies the audio without re-encoding, and outputs the stabilized video with a valid name.\n\n4) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it generates a correct and working ffmpeg command according to user requirements and adheres to the ffmpeg man page specifications."
