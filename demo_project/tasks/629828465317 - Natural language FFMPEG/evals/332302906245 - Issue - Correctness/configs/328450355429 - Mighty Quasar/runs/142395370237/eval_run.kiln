  "output": "To extract frames from `video.mp4` every 5 seconds and save them as lossless PNG images, use the `fps` filter to control the frame rate. Since PNG is a lossless format by default, no additional parameters are required for compression settings. The `%04d` format ensures sequentially numbered output files.\n\n- `-vf fps=1/5`: Sets the frame rate to 1 frame every 5 seconds.\n- `output_%04d.png`: Saves frames as numbered PNG files (e.g., `output_0001.png`, `output_0002.png`).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=1/5 output_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the `<issue_description>`. The generated command correctly extracts frames from the input video every 5 seconds, saves them as PNG files, and adheres to the requirement of using a lossless format. The explanation provided aligns with the command functionality and the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in `<failure_example>`. The command correctly uses valid ffmpeg options and does not reference nonexistent presets or parameters.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are consistent with the expected syntax and functionality for frame extraction to PNG format.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the prompt. It successfully meets the requirements set forth by the user, and therefore, it passes the evaluation."
