  "input": "Can you double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` but keep the original audio pitch?",
  "output": "To double the playback speed of `fast_forward.mp4` while preserving the audio pitch, you should filter the video to speed it up and, to maintain pitch, use the `asetrate` filter only if the audio sample rate needs proportionate adjustment (though with some input assumptions, if the sample rate is adjustable). In general, copying audio as-is (`-c:a copy`) provides pitch preservation.\n\n**Key points:**\n- Use the `setpts` filter to reduce the presentation timestamps of the video by a factor of 2, thus doubling the playback speed.\n- Copy the original audio stream (-c:a copy) without altering pitch.\n- Output MP4 container is assumed with H.264 video encoding for broad compatibility (`-c:v libx264`).\n\nHere is the ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -map 0:a -c:v libx264 -c:a copy output_double_speed.mp4\n```\n\n*Explanation:*\n- `-filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v]\"` speeds up video playback by 2x.\n- `-map \"[v]\"` selects the modified video stream.\n- `-map 0:a` copies original audio without changes.\n- `-c:v libx264` re-encodes video to H.264.\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio as-is.\n\nIf your audio had a sample rate that caused incorrect audio speed, you could use `asetrate`, but for typical use, copying the audio preserves pitch naturally. This approach handles most standard \"doubling speed\" scenarios.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain** the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to perform the requested transformation (doubling the speed of the video while preserving the audio pitch) correctly. It uses the correct filters and options according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command generated is complex and includes valid ffmpeg options and filters, unlike the failing example, which contains an incorrect preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not break** any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are valid and correctly applied according to the rules laid out in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should **pass** the evaluation."
