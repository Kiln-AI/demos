  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from video.avi and save them as PNG images at the video's original (best possible) resolution:\n\n- The `-vf fps=1/2` filter tells ffmpeg to select one frame every 2 seconds (1 frame per 2 seconds).\n- Output files are named sequentially as frame_%04d.png (e.g., frame_0001.png).\n- PNG is a lossless format, preserving maximum quality and resolution.\n- No scaling is applied, so the resolution matches the source (\"ultra high resolution\" is assumed to mean the original video resolution).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nIf your source is greater than your current display/require even higher resolution, and the video was scaled down, let me know so I can provide upscale options.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to correctly fulfill the user's request to extract frames every 2 seconds, save them as PNG images at the original resolution of the video, and the explanation accurately explains the parameters used in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command is syntactically correct and uses valid options. It does not contain any nonexistent options or incorrect parameters that would lead to failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Both the input and output specifications are correctly formatted, as is the use of the `-vf` filter and the output file naming sequence.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described, it passes the evaluation."
