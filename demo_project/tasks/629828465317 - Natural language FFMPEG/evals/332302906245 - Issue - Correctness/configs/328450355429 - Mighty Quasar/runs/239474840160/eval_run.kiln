  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode the subtitles from `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` and set their color to yellow, I'll use the `force_style` option in FFmpeg. This option allows you to apply style settings to the subtitles, including color.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The `subtitles.srt` file is in the same directory as `movie.mkv`.\n- The subtitle format is SRT (which is standard and supported by FFmpeg).\n- The color should be yellow, which is represented as `&H00FFFF` in the `force_style` syntax (used by many subtitle renderers).\n- You want the subtitles to be burned into the video and not as a separate track.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -i subtitles.srt -c copy -c:s mov_text -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng -force_style \"PrimaryColor=&H00FFFF\" output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command copies all video and audio streams from the original MKV file and burns the SRT subtitles into the video using the `mov_text` codec. The `-force_style` option applies the yellow color to the subtitles.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command provided is incorrect because it incorrectly uses `-c:s mov_text` for hardcoding subtitles, which is not a valid option for hardcoding (burning) subtitles into a video. Instead, the correct approach should involve using a filter specifically for subtitles, such as `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColor=&H00FFFF'\"`. Furthermore, `-force_style` is not directly applicable via command line with FFmpegâ€™s filter; it's more suited to the ASS subtitle format, not SRT directly as suggested in this output. \n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example because it incorrectly attempts to specify the wrong codec options for burning in subtitles, which would lead to a failure in executing the command. The command could produce an error related to invalid options.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks several requirements from the man page. Specifically, FFmpeg does not support the `-c:s mov_text` codec for hardcoding subtitles. The correct implementation for hardcoding would involve using the `-vf` option with a filter that processes the subtitles in a supported manner, as described in the man page for text-rendering of subtitle files.\n\nConclusively, since the output contains incorrect options and approaches that do not align with the user requirements or FFmpeg's capabilities, it fails to fulfill the task effectively."
