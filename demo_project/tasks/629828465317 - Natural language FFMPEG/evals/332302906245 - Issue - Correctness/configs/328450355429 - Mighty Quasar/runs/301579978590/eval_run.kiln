  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "In ffmpeg, filter chains are evaluated from left to right, meaning the first filter in the chain applies first, then its result is used by the next, and so on. To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in that order, use the following filter chain:\n\n- First, apply temporal noise reduction (e.g., the nlmeans [Non-local Means] filter for accurate temporal denoising).\n- Next, use spatial denoising (e.g., the hqdn3d filter, good for general spatial noise reduction).\n- Lastly, apply edge enhancement (e.g., unsharp mask) to sharpen details.\n\nHereâ€™s the ffmpeg command with that sequence:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"nlmeans,hqdn3d,unsharp=3:3:0.8:2:2:0.4\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `nlmeans`: Temporal noise reduction filter; values like default parameters work for moderate noise. Adjust as needed.\n- `hqdn3d`: Spatial denoising. You can adjust strength with parameters (default is fine for most cases).\n- `unsharp=3:3:0.8:2:2:0.4`: Edge enhancement for detail sharpening.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- Input is named input.mp4.  \n- Output uses H.264 video, copying the original audio.  \n- Adjust filter parameters as necessary for your specific media.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output appears to provide a valid ffmpeg command that applies the specified filters in the correct order, and there are no evident mistakes in its syntax based on the filter options. Therefore, it does not contain any issues as described.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example given. The command provided by the model does not contain a non-existent preset or any incorrect syntax that would cause it to fail. Instead, it appears to be structured correctly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command uses valid filter options for noise reduction and enhancement and properly sequenced filters, which is compliant with how ffmpeg operates. The options provided for the filters (like `nlmeans`, `hqdn3d`, and `unsharp`) are appropriately used in the command.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, meaning it should pass the evaluation based on the criteria. There are no syntactical errors, and the command meets the user's specifications correctly."
