  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations (rotation and scaling) in ffmpeg, apply these filters in sequence after your input. Each filter is applied as a top-level `-vf` option, preserving the order of operations. Note that stabilization takes output from the previous filter chain, so it should come before color grading and scaling.\n\nKey points:\n\n- `-vf vstabilize` applies scene-based stabilization.\n- Apply color grading using a `colorchannelmixer` or by converting to an intermediate color space (e.g., log).\n- Use `scale` and `rotate` for geometric transformations.\n- Maintain pixel format as `yuv420p` or `yuv420p10le` if color grading with higher bit depth requires it for compatibility.\n- Consider the computational cost and impact on CPU/GPU (e.g., use `-vsync 1` if CPU is limited).\n- Use `-c:a copy` to keep the audio stream unchanged if you donâ€™t want to process it.\n\nExample command using H.264 for video encoding with x264 encoder for efficient stabilization, color grading at 12 bit deep, and rotation:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -vf \"vstabilize,format=yuv420p10le,colorchannelmatrix='256/128:256/128:256/128',rotate=15,scale=1280:720\" \\\n  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -cpu-used 0 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le \\\n  -c:a copy output_stab_grad_scaling.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `vstabilize` is applied after the input and before color grading.\n- `format=yuv420p10le` ensures 10-bit color depth for better color grading quality.\n- `colorchannelmatrix` applies a 3x3 matrix for advanced color grading (here, a white balance adjustment).\n- `rotate=15` applies a 15 degree rotation after stabilization and color grading.\n- `scale=1280:720` resizes the video to a standard 720p HD resolution.\n\nThis approach ensures each filter operates only on well-prepared input and outputs, resulting in smooth, graded, and stabilized footage. Adjust parameters as needed for your specific footage and system resources.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appears to reasonably fulfill the user's requirement for chaining together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations. The output has the correct structure and properly utilizes the `-vf` option to apply filters in sequence.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model is more complex and correctly employs multiple filters along with appropriate options, none of which are invalid or nonexistent.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements stated in the man page. It follows the syntax rules for applying filters and correctly lists the output file after the filter chain. The options utilized for filters and encoding adhere to acceptable practices with no conflicting options present.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, therefore it should pass. The command appears sound, adheres to usage conventions, and satisfies the user's request."
