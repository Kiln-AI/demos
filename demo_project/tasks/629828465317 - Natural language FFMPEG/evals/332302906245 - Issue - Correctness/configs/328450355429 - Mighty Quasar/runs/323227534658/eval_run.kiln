  "input": "I need to compress video.avi to a smaller file size using the superfast preset and high quality settings",
  "output": "To compress video.avi while favoring encoding speed and still aiming for good visual quality, we choose a fast H.264 encoder preset (“superfast”) and balance the quality/bitrate by specifying a very low CRF value. CRF ≈18–23 is considered “visually lossless/very high quality”; going lower means larger file, so we start at 18. Audio is kept in AAC at 192 kb/s for transparent fidelity. The output is written to the universally-supported MP4 container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p compressed.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n- You want a .mp4 container and don’t care about the original container/codec.\n- CRF 18 is “high quality” yet still yields noticeable size reduction (feel free to raise CRF—e.g. 23–28—for smaller files).\n- Audio is copied/trans-coded, not stripped, and 192 kb/s AAC is perceptually sufficient.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is valid and matches the requirements from the user's request for compression of the video file. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example given (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command produced by the model does not contain any incorrect options or presets; \"superfast\" is a legitimate preset for the libx264 encoder.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command is properly formatted, and all specified codecs, options, and parameters are valid and in the correct order.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes because it generates a correct, functional ffmpeg command that adheres to the requirements set in the user input and the ffmpeg documentation."
