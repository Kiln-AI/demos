  "input": "I need to compress a video to 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming.",
  "output": "To compress a video to a target bitrate of 500 Mbps using H.264 encoding, you can specify the video bitrate with `-b:v 500M`. For streaming purposes, it's also good to set the AAC audio codec and place the metadata at the start for faster playback start. \n\nNote: 500 Mbps is an extremely high bitrate for video streaming and likely unnecessary unless you have a very high resolution or need very high quality. Please adjust accordingly if this is too high.\n\nHere's the command assuming your input file is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 500M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a valid ffmpeg command that correctly specifies the desired video bitrate of 500 Mbps using `-b:v 500M`, along with appropriate encoding parameters for audio and streaming.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. There are no invalid options or parameters in the command generated by the model. All included options are valid and should execute without errors in ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax and options for setting the video bitrate, specifying the codec, and formatting options for streaming. \n\n4) Since the model's output is valid, adheres to the expectations of the user input, and complies with the ffmpeg man page requirements, it can be said to pass the evaluation."
