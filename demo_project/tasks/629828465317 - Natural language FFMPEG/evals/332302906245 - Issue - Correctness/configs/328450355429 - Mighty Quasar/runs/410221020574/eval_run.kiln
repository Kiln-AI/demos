  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using the `deshake` filter in `ffmpeg`, we'll need to extract the audio from the video, apply the `deshake` filter to the video, and then combine the two streams. \n\nAssuming the video `bumpy_ride.mp4` is the input file, we'll also assume the same audio stream is used.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -map_metadata 1 -map_audio 0 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -deshake -c:a copy output_stabilized.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map_metadata 1` and `-map_audio 0` instruct `ffmpeg` to keep the metadata and audio streams separate, allowing us to apply the `deshake` filter only to the video stream.\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures the output video uses the yuv420p format, which is compatible with most devices.\n- `-deshake` applies the `deshake` filter to the video stream, which removes the camera shake effect.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream from the input, without re-encoding it, which can help maintain the original audio quality.\n\nNote: The `deshake` filter might not work perfectly on all types of footage, especially if the camera shake is significant or if the video is handheld in an awkward way. In such cases, using a gimbal or a different camera rig might be necessary to achieve a smooth video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. Specifically, the command `ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -map_metadata 1 -map_audio 0 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -deshake -c:a copy output_stabilized.mp4` does not correctly apply the `deshake` filter, as it is not a valid filter option in the given syntax. The `-map_audio` option should be `-map 0:a` (or similar) to accurately describe the audio mapping. Also, `-map_metadata 1` is incorrect since there is only one input file, so it should be `-map_metadata 0`.\n\n2) The output is similar to a failing output as it generates a command with invalid options such as `-map_audio`, which doesn't exist in the proper `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks the requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. Specifically, the option `-map_audio` is incorrect and should be adjusted to correctly reference the audio stream from the first input file. Furthermore, `-map_metadata 1` fails because there is only one input file present (indexed as 0).\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the modelâ€™s output fails due to errors in the command syntax that do not adhere to the requirements of `ffmpeg`, meaning it cannot generate a functional command for stabilizing the video."
