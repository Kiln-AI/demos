  "input": "Convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound using the cinema_quality preset and save as WAV",
  "output": "To convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound, upmix the input to 8 channels (7.1 layout), set a cinema-standard sample rate of 48kHz, and use 32-bit PCM for high-fidelity audio. The upmixing is achieved using FFmpeg's `aresample` audio filter, ensuring the output WAV matches typical cinema audio specifications.\n\n- **`-af aresample=channel_layout=7.1:sample_rate=48000:sample_fmt=s32`**:  \n  Resamples the audio to 7.1 channel layout (8 channels), 48kHz sample rate, and 32-bit integer format. This ensures compatibility with cinematic audio standards.\n- **`-c:a pcm_s32le`**:  \n  Encodes the output using 32-bit little-endian integer PCM (raw audio) in the WAV container, preserving high quality.\n- **Assumptions**:  \n  - Input is stereo (2 channels). FFmpeg will generate the remaining 6 channels with default upmixing (potentially simulating a simple surround feel, though not advanced cinema-specific matrices without additional parameters).  \n  - \"cinema_quality\" is interpreted as typical cinema audio specs (48kHz, 24-bit/32-bit depth), but FFmpeg doesn't have a named \"cinema_quality\" preset for audio. This command focuses on standard upmixing and sample rate/format alignment.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"aresample=channel_layout=7.1:sample_rate=48000:sample_fmt=s32\" -c:a pcm_s32le -channel_layout 7.1 -sample_rate 48000 output_7_1_cinema.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. The command generated does not correctly implement the necessary functionality to convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound. The `aresample` filter is used incorrectly for this purpose. To achieve a stereo to 7.1 upmix, another method such as the `pan` filter should be used to specifically define how the channels are mapped and upmixed, rather than `aresample`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example because it does not include a clearly invalid option like the non-existent `preset extra_fast`. However, it does use `aresample` in a context that doesn't align with the intended audio transformation, leading to potentially non-functional output despite being syntactically correct.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page, in terms of syntax and structure. However, it does not produce the expected result based on the user's request for stereo to 7.1 conversion accurately. While the command may run without error, the resulting audio will not be a properly upmixed 7.1 surround sound, violating the user's intent.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation—since the output does not generate the correct transformation for the user's request—it should fail as it does contain the issue previously outlined."
