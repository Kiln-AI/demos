  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and save them as ultra high resolution PNG images, I'll use the `fps` filter to control the frame rate and the `fps=1/2` parameter to select one frame every 2 seconds. I'll set a very high resolution using `s=4096x2160` (4K) and ensure output format is PNG.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The video has a standard frame rate, and we're extracting one frame per 2 seconds.\n- You want each extracted frame to be in 4K resolution (4096x2160) for ultra high quality.\n- The frames will be saved sequentially in the current directory with a naming pattern like `frame_0001.png`, `frame_0002.png`, etc.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=1/2,scale=4096:2160\" -frames:v 9999 frame_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is syntactically correct and meets the requirements of extracting frames from a video file at two-second intervals and saving them as PNG images in ultra high resolution.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example that uses a non-existent preset. The generated command uses valid parameters and options according to ffmpeg's functionalities.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used in the ffmpeg command, including `-i`, `-vf`, and the output naming convention, align with ffmpeg's expected usage of options. The command effectively specifies the input video, applies a video filter for frame extraction and scaling, and correctly formats the output file names.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n\nThe output should **pass** as it does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is valid and aligns with the user's request successfully."
