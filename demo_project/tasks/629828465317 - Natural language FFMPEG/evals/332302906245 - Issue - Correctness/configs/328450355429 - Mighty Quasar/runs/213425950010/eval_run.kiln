  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress your video (video.mp4) for maximum storage efficiency, use the H.264 codec with the libx264 encoder’s \"veryslow\" preset, which optimizes compression efficiency. The CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value controls quality—higher values yield smaller files with more quality loss. For strong compression while retaining acceptable quality, CRF 28 is a good starting point, but adjust as needed.\n\n- -c:v libx264: uses the H.264 codec.\n- -preset veryslow: maximizes compression efficiency (at the cost of encoding speed).\n- -crf 28: higher CRF means more compression, less quality.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 96k: compresses audio efficiently.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart compressed_video.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions: You want to keep the MP4 format and retain reasonable playback compatibility. Adjust the CRF value as necessary for your quality/storage trade-off.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart compressed_video.mp4`) is valid and aligns with the user request to compress the file for maximum efficiency.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command it generated uses the valid preset `veryslow`, which does exist, and does not use an erroneous or invalid parameter.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. All the specified options are appropriate, and the order of parameters is correctly maintained as required by `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output should pass, as it does not contain any issues and generates a valid command."
