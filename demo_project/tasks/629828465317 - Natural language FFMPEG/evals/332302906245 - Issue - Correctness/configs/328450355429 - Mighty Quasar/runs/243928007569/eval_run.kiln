  "output": "To transform `input.mp4` into an MKV file with the video re-encoded using the **x265 encoder (libx265)** with the `veryslow` preset, while **copying the audio stream directly** without re-encoding, the following command is used. This assumes the audio format is already compatible with MKV (e.g., AAC, Vorbis, etc.) and that the video needs to be re-encoded for format or quality purposes.\n\n- `-c:v libx265`: Specifies the x265/HEVC video encoder.\n- `-preset veryslow`: Uses the highest compression efficiency (slowest encoding time).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the existing audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is **not needed** for MKV output (it's specific to MP4 streaming).\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n---\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. The audio stream in `input.mp4` is already a format supported by MKV (e.g., AAC, MP3, or WAV). If not, additional audio codec parameters (`-c:a`) may be required.\n2. No resizing or other video filters are specified; the result preserves the original resolution and frame rate.\n3. If you want to further optimize video quality for streaming, you might add `-crf 18` (lower bitrate, better quality) or adjust audio parameters (e.g., `-b:a 384k` for lossless audio). Let me know if needed!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is valid and matches the requirements laid out in the user input. It correctly specifies the use of the `libx265` encoder with the `veryslow` preset and copy the audio stream without any mistakes.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The command generated is correctly formatted and utilizes valid options. The `veryslow` preset exists, and the command doesn't initiate any errors based on syntax or invalid parameters.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements laid out in the FFmpeg man page. The options used, such as `-c:v libx265`, `-preset veryslow`, and `-c:a copy`, are all valid and do not break any rules set forth in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, the evaluation passes. The command provided is correctly structured, compliant with FFmpeg requirements, and adequately meets the user's request."
