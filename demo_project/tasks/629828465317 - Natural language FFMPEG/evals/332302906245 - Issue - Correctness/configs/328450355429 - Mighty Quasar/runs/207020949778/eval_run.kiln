  "input": "I have a file `input.mov` and I want to convert it to MP4. Please use the `extra_fast` preset because speed is very important.",
  "output": "To convert input.mov to MP4 quickly, we'll use the libx264 encoder with the ultrafast preset (closest to extra_fast, as ffmpeg presets are: ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow). Since you requested extra_fast and speed is most important, ultrafast is the fastest option available. We'll copy audio as-is for speed unless you specify otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is correct and follows the user's request to use a preset that focuses on speed. It correctly uses the `ultrafast` preset as it is the closest option available to `extra_fast`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain any option that does not exist (such as `extra_fast`). Instead, it correctly substitutes it with `ultrafast`, which is a valid option in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command uses options that are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation, including input and output specifications and codec usage.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus it should pass. The command is correctly formatted, valid, and meets the user's requirements."
