  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 10,000,000 bps (10 Mbps) and audio bitrate to 1000 kbps (1 Mbps) for streaming, specify `-b:v 10M` for video and `-b:a 1000k` for audio. These settings ensure your stream has a high-quality bitrate for both video and audio. \n\n- `-b:v 10M` sets the constant video bitrate to 10 Mbps.\n- `-b:a 1000k` sets the audio bitrate to 1000 kbps.\n- To support adaptive streaming or ensure compatibility with streaming platforms, using fast start options and specifying codecs is recommended.\n\nHere's an example command assuming your source is input.mkv, and you want to output a widely supported stream-ready MP4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -b:v 10M -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264` ensures H.264 encoding.\n- `-c:a aac` ensures AAC audio.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` helps with streaming by placing the moov atom at the start of the file.\n\nIf you're streaming live using a protocol like RTMP or HLS, replace the output file with your stream URL and adjust accordingly for minimal latency.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not seem to contain any issues related to generating the command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements. The command it provided effectively sets the specified video and audio bitrates and includes necessary parameters for streaming.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated in the model's output (`ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -b:v 10M -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) does not contain any invalid parameters or flags.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, `-pix_fmt`, and `-movflags`) are all valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. The bitrates are correctly set using the proper notation (10M for video and 1000k for audio), the codecs specified are valid, and the command structure adheres to the proper syntax for ffmpeg.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output does not contain any issues per the criteria set out in the evaluation steps. Thus, it should pass."
