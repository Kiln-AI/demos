  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To reformat the vertical `story.mov` into a 16:9 widescreen video with blurred horizontal bars, the following ffmpeg command will horizontally stretch the image and apply a blur filter to the bars:\n\n- The fields `huebar=0.5, scale=1.22:aic, lut2:stretch` are used to blur the image horizontally and vertically by applying a custom LUT (lookup table). In this case, `scale=1.22:aic` means the image is stretched by a factor of approximately 1.22 in both horizontal and vertical directions (to create flat bars above and below the centerline of the image), and `huebar` affects the level of the custom LUT applied, thus influencing the amount of blur.\n- `minrate=0, maxrate=1000, bufsize=5000` is not part of the transformation but could be used to control buffer, bitrate ranges if Min and Max rates are needed.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll ignore the `minrate, maxrate, bufsize` part:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -vf \"huebar=0.5,scale=ih*1.22:aic\" -vf \"scale=w=ih*1.22,descale=ih*0.78\" movie_fitting_16_9.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes that the top and bottom 22% of the initial video's vertical bars are to be blurred, which ultimately width-aligths the video to a 16:9 aspect ratio. The descaling of `ih*0.78` re-scales the blurred area back down vertically closer to their original sizes.\n\nNote: This solution does not guarantee the blurred bars will appear on the sides since the supplied command only provides one way of doing it. In practice, you would need to provide a more complex processing pipeline, possibly involving multiple transformations to assure bars on the left and right, which cannot directly be inferred from the user's requirements.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is incorrect and doesn't match the user's requirements to add blurred bars to the left and right of a vertical video. The filters mentioned (`huebar`, `scale`, `lut2`) do not correctly implement the process of adding blurred bars on the sides of the video.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output (i.e., `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`), as the command produced by the model doesn't contain an invalid preset but instead the logic and syntax of the filters are incorrectly applied. While it fails to achieve the desired result, it does not contain an outright syntax error in terms of existing options.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page because:\n   - The use of `huebar` and `scale` in the form `huebar=0.5,scale=ih*1.22:aic` doesnâ€™t properly correspond to any known filter configuration for blurring. The assumption that this would stretch the image and create blurred bars is incorrect. Instead, filters such as `pad` with  `boxblur` or `crop` would be required to maintain aspect ratio and add blurred sections as described by the user.\n   - Combination of multiple `-vf` values is incorrect. The command uses `-vf` twice, which would cause the last `-vf` to override the first one, leading to unintended behavior.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output contains the issues described, meaning it didn't generate a command that would work correctly per user requirements, thus failing the task."
