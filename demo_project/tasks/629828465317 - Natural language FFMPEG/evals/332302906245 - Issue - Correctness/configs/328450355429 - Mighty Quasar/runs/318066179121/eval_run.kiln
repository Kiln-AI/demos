  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge several MP4 files into one continuous video, the most reliable and fast method is to concatenate them at the binary level, but this only works if all files have exactly the same codec, resolution, and encoding settings. With mp4, this involves creating a text file listing the inputs (the concat demuxer).\n\nMethod:\n1. Create a text file (e.g., `inputs.txt`) that lists the file names:\n   ```\n   file 'part1.mp4'\n   file 'part2.mp4'\n   file 'part3.mp4'\n   ```\n2. Use the concat demuxer in ffmpeg:\n\n- The `-f concat` option tells ffmpeg to use the concat demuxer.\n- `-safe 0` allows absolute paths and some special characters.\n- `-c copy` avoids re-encoding, so the process is lossless and quick.\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy merged.mp4\n```\n\nIf your files don't have matching codecs, codecs, or encoding settings, you’ll need to re-encode them. For that, remove `-c copy` and specify the codec, e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.\n\n**Assumption:** Your input MP4s have the same encoding parameters (codec, resolution, framerate, etc.) and you want a lossless, fast merge.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for the task of merging multiple video files and should work correctly under the assumption that the input files have compatible parameters (codec, resolution, etc.). There don’t appear to be any errors in the syntax or compatibility of the options used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options. It uses valid parameters and options for the `ffmpeg` tool as outlined in the command syntax.\n\n3) According to the FFmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The use of `-f concat`, `-safe 0`, `-i inputs.txt`, and `-c copy` are all valid options. The command structure respects the required order of options and input/output specifications.\n\n4) Given all of the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue mentioned, and it should pass the evaluation as there are no mistakes or compatibility issues within the `ffmpeg` command it generated."
