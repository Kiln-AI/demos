  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode subtitles into a video with yellow color, you'll use the `subtitles` filter to burn the SRT file directly into the video frames. The subtitle styling can be controlled with ASS/SSA style parameters.\n\nThe key parameters:\n- `vf subtitles=subtitles.srt` burns the SRT subtitles into the video\n- `force_style='PrimaryColour=&Hffff00'` sets the subtitle color to yellow (hex color in BGR format with &H prefix)\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding to save time\n- `-c:v libx264` re-encodes video (necessary since we're modifying the video frames)\n\nI'm assuming you want to keep the same video quality and that the subtitle timing in the SRT file matches your video.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&Hffff00'\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it provided meets the requirement of hardcoding subtitles from `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` and specifies the color as yellow. The command appears to be syntactically correct and logically matches the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&Hffff00'\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mkv`) uses valid parameters and the `force_style` option is used correctly with the subtitle filter. There are no apparent issues.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used are valid, and the ordering of input and output files, as well as the handling of parameters, adheres strictly to the guidelines provided in the man page. \n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and it passes evaluation."
