  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC using the experimental codec option, while applying noise reduction, you can use an audio filter like \"arnndn\" (a noise reduction filter with a pretrained neural network model). Since you want the experimental codec, the FLAC encoder in ffmpeg is typically stable, but you can specify the flag -strict experimental if you want.\n\nAssumption: You have a noise reduction model file available (e.g., rnnoise-model.pth or a similar file) for the arnndn filter. If you don't have such a model, a simpler noise reduction can be applied via other filters like \"afftdn\" which doesn't require an external model.\n\nHere, I'll show the command using \"afftdn\", which is a simple FFT-based denoiser built into ffmpeg.\n\nExplanation:\n- -i video.mp4 input file\n- -vn disable video output\n- -af afftdn applies the noise reduction filter\n- -c:a flac -strict experimental encodes audio to FLAC format, experimental flag added\n- output.flac is the output audio file\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\nIf you prefer using the arnndn filter (which may provide better noise reduction but requires a model file), you would do:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af arnndn=model=rnnoise-model.pth -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\nBut this assumes you have rnnoise-model.pth in your directory.\n\nPlease note that \"-strict experimental\" is often not required for FLAC encoding as it's fully supported now, but included per your request.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generated a valid `ffmpeg` command that correctly extracts audio from the specified video file and applies noise reduction, encoding it in the FLAC format as requested by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command provided by the model is valid and uses existing options and parameters available in `ffmpeg`. The example failure command contains a non-existent preset option causing it to fail, whereas the model's command correctly implements functionality present in `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used in the command, such as `-i`, `-vn`, `-af`, and `-c:a`, are all valid options for `ffmpeg`. Additionally, the `-strict experimental` flag is used correctly, although FLAC support doesn't typically require it as mentioned in the model's output. The filters applied (like `afftdn` for noise reduction) are appropriate, and the command maintains the correct order of input and output options.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It produced a correct `ffmpeg` command that adheres to the user's request and follows the syntax rules outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. Therefore, it should pass."
