  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream Matroska file, use `-map` to explicitly select the desired video and audio streams by their index (starting from 0). The `-map 0:v:11` selects the 12th video stream (index 11 = stream 12), and `-map 0:a:24` selects the 25th audio stream (index 24 = stream 25). Without re-encoding, the `-c copy` flag copies the streams directly for maximum quality and speed.\n\nAssumption: You want to keep the original codecs and container format (MKV being the source format).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:11 -map 0:a:24 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is logically correct, properly uses the `-map` option to select specific video and audio streams, and employs the `-c copy` flag to ensure that the streams are copied directly without re-encoding. This aligns with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example, which contains an incorrect preset (`extra_fast`) that does not exist. In contrast, the command generated by the model is syntactically and semantically correct.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` to specify which streams to include is correctly implemented, and the `-c copy` option for stream copying is valid and follows the guidelines laid out in the man page.\n\nBased on the above evaluations, the model's output is accurate and performs well concerning the task requirements."
