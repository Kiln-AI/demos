  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert your MXF file to MP4 with a locked 5000 kb/s bitrate using VBR (Variable Bitrate), you'll use the `-b:v` parameter for target bitrate combined with `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` to constrain the bitrate variation within VBR encoding.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 encoding (standard for MP4)\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the target video bitrate to 5000 kb/s\n- `-maxrate 5000k` caps the maximum bitrate to 5000 kb/s (this \"locks\" it)\n- `-bufsize 5000k` sets the buffer size equal to max bitrate for tight control\n- `-c:a aac` encodes audio using AAC codec\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\nNote: This creates a constrained VBR where the encoder can vary quality to maintain the 5000 kb/s target, but won't exceed it. If you need truly constant bitrate (CBR), you would add `-minrate 5000k` as well.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 5000k -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command produced appears to accurately reflect the user's request to convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 while locking the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the Variable Bitrate (VBR) setting. The explanation clearly outlines how the various parameters align with the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The example provided indicates an invalid command due to a non-existent preset, while the model's output creates a valid command according to the user request. All options used in the generated command are valid and correctly applied.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command does not break any requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. \n- The options used (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-c:a`, and `-pix_fmt`) are all valid and appropriately applied according to the syntax described. \n- The command properly specifies the input file, codecs, bitrate settings, and output file format, following the required order of options and complying with ffmpeg's operational rules.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. Overall, the output meets the conditions of the task, generating a valid ffmpeg command that adheres to the user's request and does not conflict with the man page specifications. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
