  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using ffmpeg's `deshake` filter, you can apply it with recommended parameters to smooth out the unwanted camera movements. The `shakiness` parameter controls the size and strength of the stabilization (higher values stabilize larger shakes), while `accuracy` balances regularity and effectiveness. Using a moderate preset (shakiness=5, accuracy=15) is a good starting point—feel free to adjust them based on your video’s specifics.\n\nHere's how you can do this:\n\n- `-vf \"deshake=shakiness=5:accuracy=15\"` applies the deshaking filter with moderate stability.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding, preserving audio quality and saving processing time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=shakiness=5:accuracy=15\" -c:a copy stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4\n```\n\nIf the video still has residual shakes, consider increasing `shakiness` to 8 or 10, or `accuracy` to 20 for stronger stabilization. This approach ensures smooth playback with minimal quality impact.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model is valid and matches the user's requirements for stabilizing the video using the `deshake` filter.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and uses existing and valid parameters while the failure example provided a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`).\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The output command correctly specifies the input file, applies the deshake filter, and copies the audio without re-encoding. All components conform to the usual command format and option rules for ffmpeg.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus passes the evaluation."
