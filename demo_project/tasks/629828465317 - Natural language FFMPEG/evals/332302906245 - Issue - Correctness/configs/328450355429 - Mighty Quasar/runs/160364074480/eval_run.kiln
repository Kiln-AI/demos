  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text on a video and apply a blur effect, you can chain multiple filters using the `-vf` option in ffmpeg, separated by commas. The overlay can be added with the `drawtext` filter, while the blur can be applied with the `gblur` filter. The order of filters affects the result; typically, you'd apply blur first and then overlay text on the blurred video.\n\n- `gblur=sigma=10` applies a Gaussian blur with a specified sigma.\n- `drawtext` overlays text; customize `text`, `fontfile`, `fontsize`, `fontcolor`, `x`, and `y` as needed.\n- Multiple filters are separated by commas within the `-vf` parameter.\n\nAssumptions: You'll specify your input video filename and the desired output filename, and you'll customize the text overlay parameters as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"gblur=sigma=10, drawtext=text='Sample Text':fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and matches the user's request to overlay text and apply a blur effect using the proper syntax for chaining filters in `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is valid and does not include a parameter or option that is incorrect, like the non-existent preset `extra_fast` in the failure example.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for `ffmpeg`, the command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The usage of `-vf` to chain filters with the correct parameters for blurring and overlaying text is appropriate. The command adheres to the general rules for `ffmpeg`, where options are applied correctly to the specified file, with no violations on filter syntax.\n\n4) Hence, considering all the evaluations, it can be concluded that the model performed well and produced an appropriate `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements without any errors. The output does not contain the issues stated."
