  "input": "Convert input.mov to MP4 with super_fast encoding preset to process it quickly",
  "output": "To quickly convert input.mov to MP4 using FFmpeg while prioritizing speed, use the libx264 H.264 encoder with the superfast preset. This makes encoding much faster at the cost of larger file size and slightly lower compression efficiency, which is usually acceptable for rapid processing. AAC is used for audio, and -movflags +faststart optimizes the MP4 for web playback.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of parameters:**\n- -c:v libx264: Sets the video codec to H.264 for wide compatibility.\n- -preset superfast: Speeds up encoding at the expense of compression efficiency.\n- -crf 23: Balances quality and compression; can be lowered for higher quality.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: Encodes audio as AAC at 128kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart: Moves MP4 metadata to the start for better streaming performance.\n- output.mp4: The resulting MP4 filename.\n\nThis command assumes input.mov is a standard MOV video file with common audio/video streams. Adjust bitrate or CRF as needed for your quality requirements.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly reflects the user's request for quick conversion of the `input.mov` to MP4 using the `superfast` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) correctly uses the existing `superfast` preset and includes necessary parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All used options are valid, and their order is correct according to the syntax rules mentioned.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described; it is appropriate and correctly generates a working ffmpeg command. It should pass."
