  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "You're correctly combining temporal (`yadif`) and spatial (`scale`, `unsharp`) filters in the filter chain. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- `yadif=mode=1`: Temporal deinterlacing filter (mode=1 is the default, but explicitly specified here).  \n- `scale=1920:1080`: Spatial scaling to 1920×1080 resolution (no aspect ratio adjustment is implied here, so content may be cropped or stretched depending on input).  \n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0`: Spatial sharpening filter with custom kernel size and strength.  \n\nThe filters are applied in the order specified, which is appropriate: deinterlacing first, then scaling, then sharpening. No additional parameters are needed unless you want to fine-tune sharpness or handle aspect ratio mismatches.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Input file is interlaced (requires `yadif`).  \n- You want exact 1920×1080 resolution (no aspect ratio preservation).  \n- No additional encoding settings (e.g., bitrate, codec) are specified beyond the filters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated uses correct syntax and accurately reflects the user's request to apply multiple video filters for deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening. Therefore, this passes the check for correctness.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. It correctly formats the command with valid parameters and options. There are no known errors with the specified command options or values, so this also passes the comparison to the failure example.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options specified in the output are valid and follow the correct syntax as outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output is correct and there are no issues with the command it generated, it passes the evaluation. The command will work correctly for the task described in the user message."
