  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a file, you can use the `-map` option to select streams by their index. The first video stream is usually `0:v:0` or simply `0:0` assuming video is the first stream, and the third audio stream would be `0:a:2` (since counting starts from zero). We will copy both streams without re-encoding using `-c copy`, and save the output as an MP4 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command takes the first video stream and the third audio stream from `movie.mkv`, copies them directly, and writes them to `final.mp4`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly maps the first video stream and the third audio stream, and the use of `-c copy` suggests that the command will work as intended by copying the streams without re-encoding. The output is appropriate for the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command `ffmpeg -i input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` is invalid because the preset does not exist. In contrast, the generated command from the model (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4`) is syntactically and semantically correct according to ffmpeg's command structure.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command correctly specifies input and output files, uses valid mapping of streams, and applies the correct option for copying streams. The order of the command and options is also appropriate.\n\n4) Considering all the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and is a correct and functioning ffmpeg command. Thus, it should pass."
