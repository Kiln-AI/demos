  "output": "Here's the `ffmpeg` command that applies your specified temporal (YADIF) and spatial (scaling and unsharp) filters.\n\n*   `-vf` specifies the video filter graph.\n*   `yadif=mode=1` applies the Yet Another Deinterlacing Filter (YADIF) in mode 1, which typically provides a good balance between quality and processing speed.\n*   `scale=1920:1080` scales the video to 1920x1080 resolution.\n*   `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0` applies an unsharp mask to sharpen the video. `luma_msize_x` and `luma_msize_y` define the size of the unsharp mask kernel, and `luma_amount` controls the strength of the sharpening effect.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It generates a correct `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's request for applying temporal and spatial filters, specifically using the YADIF deinterlacing filter, scaling, and applying an unsharp filter. The command follows the required syntax and parameters.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and includes all the necessary components without any incorrect or non-existent options like in the failure example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All the filters (`yadif`, `scale`, and `unsharp`) are valid and adhere to the expected syntax for the `-vf` option. The way the filters are chained and the overall structure of the command comply with the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes the evaluation. The command is correctly structured and meets the user's requirements."
