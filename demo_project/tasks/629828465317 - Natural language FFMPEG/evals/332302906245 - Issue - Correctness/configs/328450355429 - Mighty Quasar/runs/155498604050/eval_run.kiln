  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a file and combine them into a single output, you specify the stream indexes with `-map`. Stream indexing starts from 0, so stream 10 is `-map 10` and stream 18 is `-map 18`. You also need to set codecs to copy the streams without re-encoding to preserve quality and speed.\n\n- `-map 10` selects the video stream from stream index 10.\n- `-map 18` selects the audio stream from stream index 18.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams directly without re-encoding.\n- `-strict experimental` may be required for some formats or codecs.\n\nAssuming the streams are compatible, use the following:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 10 -map 18 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.ts\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not seem to contain the issue described. The command generated accurately reflects the request to extract specific video and audio streams from the file `broadcast.ts` and combine them, using the correct parameters and syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The generated command does not contain any invalid options or references to nonexistent presets or codecs; it adheres to the specified requirements without introducing legal issues in the command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies input and output files, uses valid options for stream mapping and codec selection, and follows the general rules regarding command structure and options explained in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the above analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the input. The generated command appears to be correct, functional, and suitable for the user's request. Therefore, it should pass."
