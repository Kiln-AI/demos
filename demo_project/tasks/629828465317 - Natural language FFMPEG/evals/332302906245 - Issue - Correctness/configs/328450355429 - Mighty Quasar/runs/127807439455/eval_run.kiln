  "output": "To efficiently extract audio from a video file and save it simultaneously as both MP3 and WAV formats, you can use ffmpeg's stream copy feature along with multiple output specifications in one command. \n\n- The input specified once (`-i input.ext`) minimizes input reading overhead.\n- Outputs are configured as separate files (`output.mp3` and `output.wav`).\n- For MP3, `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps for high quality.\n- For WAV, no compression is applied, so audio quality is lossless.\n- Using `-map 0:a` ensures only audio streams are processed.\n- Applying `-c:a libmp3lame` explicitly encodes MP3 audio with the powerful LAME encoder.\n- Using `-c:a pcm_s16le` or `-c:a pcm_s16le` (WAV default), ensures uncompressed, high-quality audio output.\n- The `-preset` is omitted here to use default encoding speeds for maximum compatibility and speed.\n- This approach avoids duplicate caption or video processing, optimizing performance.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -map 0:a -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3 -map 0:a -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n```\n\n*Replace `input.ext` with your actual video filename and extension (e.g., `video.mp4`).*",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be correct and meets the user's requirement of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as both MP3 and WAV formats.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it proposed does not contain any mistakes like an incorrect preset or option that does not exist. The options and commands used in the output are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options is correctly applied to the respective output files, and the specific options chosen (like `-map`, `-c:a`, and `-b:a`) adhere to the required syntax and logic outlined in the man page.\n\n4) The model’s output does not contain the issue described; it correctly fulfills the user’s request according to ffmpeg's usage guidelines. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
