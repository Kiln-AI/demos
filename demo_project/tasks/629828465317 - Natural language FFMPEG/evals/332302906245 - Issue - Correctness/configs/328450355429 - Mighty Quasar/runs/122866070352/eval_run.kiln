  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the video stream unchanged and extract only the third audio track from movie.mkv, you'll use the -map option. By default, ffmpeg maps all streams. Use -map 0:v:0 to select the first video stream (index 0, type v) and -map 0:a:2 to select the third audio stream (index 2, type a). Remember, stream indexing starts at 0, so the third track is number 2. You can choose any output format; here, I'll use MKV to match the input.\n\n- -map 0:v:0 maps the first video stream from the input (0:v:0) to the output.\n- -map 0:a:2 maps the third audio stream from the input (0:a:2) to the output.\n- -c copy copies video/audio streams without re-encoding (fast and lossless).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy movie_out.mkv\n```\n\nThis command will create movie_out.mkv, containing the original video and only the third audio track from the input file. This approach is efficient and maintains quality. If your desired audio is not the third but another number, adjust accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the first video stream and the third audio stream from the input file, adheres to the user's requirements, and does not introduce any errors.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and adheres to ffmpeg command structure. It does not contain any non-existent options or misconfigurations that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated by the man page for ffmpeg. The options used are appropriate: `-map` is employed correctly to specify which streams to include in the output, and the `-c copy` option indicates that the streams should be copied without re-encoding, which is acceptable.\n\nIn summary, the model's output command is accurate, conforms to user requirements, and adheres to ffmpeg rules, thus indicating that the model's performance for this task can be deemed successful."
