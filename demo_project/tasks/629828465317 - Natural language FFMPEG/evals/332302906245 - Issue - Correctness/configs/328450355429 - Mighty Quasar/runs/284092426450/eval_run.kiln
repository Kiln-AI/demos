  "input": "Convert input.mkv to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset for maximum compression",
  "output": "To convert the input.mkv file to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset for maximum compression, use `-c:v libx265 -preset placebo` to enable libx265 encoding and the placebo preset, which optimizes for the smallest output size. However, AVI is a container format, and not a destination format in itself, so we'll outputting an ffmpeg container and still need a video codec that supports both the higher quality container (MKV) and the lower quality destination (AVI). The MP4 container was used here as it makes it easy, but the conversion below isn't suitable for 100% compatibility with AVI, due to it not supporting all types of color spaces.\n\n- Set input file to `input.mkv` with `-i input.mkv` to tell ffmpeg which file to start from.\n- Use `libx265` with a lower bit depth: `yuv420p10le` to convert raw video data from libx265 into yuv420p to keep compatibility with 20+ older devices which can't support high-bit-depth.\n- Apply the `crf 23` for quality control. Lower the number lowers the quality.\n- Output as a file named output.avi: \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -yuv420p10le -c:a copy -movflags +faststart -f avi output.avi\n```\n \nNote: `-fflags +movextinf=1` might not be necessary in some versions of ffmpeg to get the correct output (when using the container), removing that command should result in the same avi as the original mkv with the high quality codecs used in the mkv.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model's output does contain an issue. The command it generated suggests using both `libx265` and the `placebo` preset, which is acceptable. However, it incorrectly combines this with an output format of AVI, which is not optimal for `libx265`. The output also erroneously includes pixel format options that wouldn't work with AVI. AVI format typically uses codecs like MPEG-4 or MJPEG, whereas `libx265` is better supported in container formats like MP4 or MKV. The command also misapplies `-yuv420p10le`, which isn't a valid pixel format flag and would not function in this context.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - Yes, the output is similar to the failure example in that it includes incorrect parameters that would lead to a misconfigured command. The output suggests using an unsupported pixel format for AVI while also stating that AVI isn't a suitable container for the selected codec.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Yes, the command does break requirements from the man page. Using `libx265` with the AVI container is unlikely to produce a functional output, as AVI does not support all features of the `libx265` codec. The use of `-yuv420p10le`, which is not suitable for AVI, also breaks the FFmpeg's codec compatibility guidelines. Ideally, `libx265` should be used with formats like MP4 or MKV to ensure proper functionality and compatibility.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does contain the issue described since the command would likely fail to provide the expected functionality and compatibility based on the specifications provided in the user input and the FFmpeg man page. Therefore, it would fail the evaluation."
