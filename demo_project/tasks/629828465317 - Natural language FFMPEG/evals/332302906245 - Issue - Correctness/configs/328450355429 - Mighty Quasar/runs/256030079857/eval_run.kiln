  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from the input file without re-encoding the video, you can use `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream as-is, and `-an` to disable audio output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation because the generated command is correct. It adheres to the user's requirement of removing all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream. The command correctly uses `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream without re-encoding, and `-an` to remove the audio stream, which matches the user's specifications.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing example. The ffmpeg command given by the model does not feature any incorrect or non-existent options. The parameters used (`-c:v copy` and `-an`) are both valid and commonly used in ffmpeg commands.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break any requirements in the man page. It correctly follows the general rule of applying options to the specified input and output files. The use of `-c:v copy` and `-an` is appropriate and effective for the user's goal of removing audio without altering the video stream.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it correctly generates a command that fulfills the user's request without any mistakes. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
