  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the specific streams from input.avi, use the `-map` option with their indices (0:v:1 for the second video stream, 0:a:3 for the fourth audio track). Since the output is MP4, transcode the video to H.264 and audio to AAC for compatibility. The default settings are used for simplicity, but you can adjust quality or codec parameters as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac result.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file contains at least 2 video streams and 4 audio tracks.  \n- The user wants to re-encode the selected streams into MP4 with H.264 video and AAC audio (standard for compatibility).  \n- If the original streams are already compatible with MP4, use `-c copy` instead of specifying codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly extracts the specified video and audio streams as required by the user input. It appropriately uses the `-map` option to select the correct streams and specifies the codecs for compatibility with MP4 format.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is valid and conforms to the parameters defined by the FFmpeg documentation. There is no indication of using an invalid option or incorrect parameter like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The command orders and options are applied as per FFmpeg's grammar rules and correctly utilize the `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` options without conflicts. The specified streams are mapped properly as well.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the model's output passes the evaluation criteria. It accurately reflects the user's request, adheres to the required command structure in FFmpeg, and avoids any command syntax errors or misconfigurations. Therefore, it does not contain the issues described in the evaluation steps."
