  "input": "I need to convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert a video to WebM format using VP8 codec with a realtime preset and constant bitrate mode, you can use the `-c:v libvpx` for VP8, `-preset realtime` for faster encoding, and specify the bitrate with `-b:v`. Constant bitrate is ensured by setting the target bitrate and potentially using `-minrate` and `-maxrate` equal to the bitrate with `-bufsize`.\n\nHere's an example command assuming you want a bitrate of 1M (1000k):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -minrate 1M -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M -preset realtime -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want audio encoded with libvorbis (commonly used with WebM).\n- Bitrate is set to 1M; you can change this as needed.\n- The realtime preset speeds up encoding at some cost to compression efficiency.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issues described in the issue description. The command generated should work correctly and meets the user's requirements to convert a video to WebM format using the VP8 codec with a realtime preset and constant bitrate settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is syntactically correct and does not utilize any invalid presets or options. It appropriately uses the VP8 codec, specifying options that adhere to the FFmpeg guidelines.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the correct order of options and the syntax is valid. The buffered size, bitrate settings, and codec specifications are all correct as per the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is effective and correctly addresses the user's input regarding the media file conversion. It accurately specifies the codecs, bitrate options, and encoding preset without any errors or issues. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
