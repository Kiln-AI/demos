  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "The libvpx-vp9 codec is used for VP9 video encoding, which is typically contained in the WebM format. MP4 container support for VP9 is limited or non-standard, so it's generally best to use VP9 with WebM. However, if you specifically want an MP4 container with VP9, it might not be widely supported or playable in many players.\n\nAssuming you want to convert your WebM file to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec and set constant bitrate (CBR), note that VP9 encoding in libvpx uses a two-pass or constrained quality approach rather than strict CBR, but you can set a target bitrate with `-b:v` and use `-minrate` and `-maxrate` to approximate CBR.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1M -minrate 1M -maxrate 1M -c:a libopus output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Specifies VP9 codec.\n- `-b:v 1M`: Sets target bitrate to 1 Mbps for CBR.\n- `-minrate 1M` and `-maxrate 1M`: Set minimum and maximum bitrate the same for approximate constant bitrate.\n- `-c:a libopus`: Use Opus codec for audio (commonly used in WebM/VP9).\n- `output.mp4`: Output filename.\n\nIf you want strict interoperability, consider using WebM as the container.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. While the command it generated does seem syntactically correct, it uses the `libvpx-vp9` codec with an MP4 container, which is generally not recommended due to limited support for this combination. Additionally, it suggests using parameters that aim to deliver a constant bitrate, but VP9 does not work in strict CBR mode. Thus, while the command might execute without an error, the resulting file may not have the desired playback compatibility or quality.\n\n2) The model's output does not exactly resemble the example of a failing output provided. The generated command is semantically valid and will execute; however, the usage of the codec with a non-standard container format indicates that it may not produce a playable result across many platforms, even if the command itself contains no outright errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All the options are specified correctly, and the parameters are valid according to the FFmpeg command syntax. It is valid to use `-c:v` to specify the video codec and set the bitrate with `-b:v`, as well as to specify a codec for audio with `-c:a`. \n\n4) The model's output does contain the issue described since the command might not meet the user's expectations for compatibility and performance when using the VP9 codec in an MP4 container. Therefore, the output fails to fulfill the underlying requirement for expected output quality and compatibility, even if it does not strictly \"fail\" in terms of command syntax or execution."
