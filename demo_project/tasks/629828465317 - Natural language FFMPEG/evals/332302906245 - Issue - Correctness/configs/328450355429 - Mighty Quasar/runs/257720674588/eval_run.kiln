  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To extract and combine specific streams from a media file, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg. -map allows you to select streams by their index: v:6 is the 7th video stream (indices start at 0), and a:13 is the 14th audio stream.\n\nThis command assumes you want to copy the streams without re-encoding for efficiency and to preserve original quality. If you need encoding, replace -c:v copy and -c:a copy with your desired codecs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\n- -i input.mov: Specifies the input file.\n- -map 0:v:6: Selects the 7th video stream from the first input.\n- -map 0:a:13: Selects the 14th audio stream from the first input.\n- -c:v copy -c:a copy: Copies streams directly to avoid re-encoding.\n- output.mov: Output filename (change extension if you re-encode to different formats).\n\nIf you need to re-encode or convert to another format, add appropriate codec options (e.g., -c:v libx264 -c:a aac for MP4). Let me know if you want a specific output format or need to re-encode.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` options to select the 7th video and 14th audio streams as requested by the user. The command syntax is valid, and it adheres to the requirement of using the correct stream index.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not contain any wrong parameter or option that would cause it to fail. Instead, it uses valid options and a proper syntax that would likely execute correctly in `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The order of the options is respected, and the parameters used (`-map`, `-c:v copy`, `-c:a copy`, etc.) are valid. The usage of `-map` followed by selecting specific video and audio streams is appropriate according to `ffmpeg` syntax. \n\n4) Considering all the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the outlined issue; therefore, it should pass."
