  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To encode your video with a constant bitrate (CBR) of 25000 kbps, you should use the -b:v 25000k parameter. This forces the video stream to target a bitrate of 25 Mbps. For consistent quality and compatibility, I recommend using the H.264 codec (libx264) and setting the buffer size and maxrate parameters for better bitrate control.\n\nHere’s an example command assuming you want to convert input.mp4 to output.mp4 with these settings:\n\n- -c:v libx264: Use the H.264 video codec.\n- -b:v 25000k: Set the target video bitrate to 25000 kbps.\n- -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k: Control bitrate spikes and rate variability.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k: Encode audio to AAC at 192 kbps (adjust as needed).\n- -movflags +faststart: Improve playback startup time for streaming.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensure broad compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The source is input.mp4; adjust as needed.\n- Output is in MP4 format with AAC audio for compatibility.\n- Audio bitrate is set to 192k, which can be changed per your requirements. \n\nThis command ensures your video stream consistently targets the specified bitrate.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe output does not contain the described issue. The generated FFmpeg command is syntactically correct, adheres to the requirements specified by the user for a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps, and includes appropriate codec options and configurations.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model is valid and does not reference non-existent presets or parameters. In contrast, the failing example uses an incorrect preset that does not exist.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements from the man page of FFmpeg. It correctly utilizes options such as `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`, and applies them in a manner consistent with the expected syntax and usage as per the documentation. All parameters used in the command are valid and in accordance with FFmpeg’s guidelines. \n\nTherefore, the model's output passes the evaluation, as it effectively meets the user’s request and complies with the FFmpeg documentation without errors."
