  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To make your video web-ready and set the video stream bitrate to 50,000 kbps (50 Mbps), you should:\n\n- Use H.264 for video encoding (-c:v libx264).\n- Set the video bitrate with -b:v 50000k.\n- Use AAC for audio and a reasonable audio bitrate, like 128 kbps (-c:a aac -b:a 128k).\n- Use -movflags +faststart to enable progressive streaming (web-ready).\n- Add -pix_fmt yuv420p for best device/browser compatibility.\n\nAssuming your input is `input.ext` (replace with your actual file name), hereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis will produce an MP4 file with a 50 Mbps video stream, ready for web delivery. Adjust the input/output file names as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated adheres to the requirements specified by the user and utilizes appropriate FFmpeg parameters. The user requested a video conversion to a specific bitrate and to make the video web-ready, and the output provided by the model satisfies these conditions.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command it generated is valid and does not include any mistakes regarding incorrect options or parameters. There are no incorrect or non-existent presets used, which ensures that the command will not fail based on an invalid argument.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used are valid, and follow the established guidelines for setting the video bitrate, defining the codecs, ensuring compatibility with various devices, and enabling progressive streaming. \n\n4) Based on this analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a correct and functional FFmpeg command that matches the user's requirements without violating any rules from the FFmpeg documentation. Thus, the model passes."
