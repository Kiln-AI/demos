  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to apply three different filters in a specific order: temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement. I need to figure out the correct filter chain syntax in ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, I should recall the available ffmpeg filters for each task. Temporal noise reduction can be done with the ttempnoisenr filter, which analyzes temporal noise. For spatial denoising, the bilateral filter or maybe the dnr filter. Edge enhancement could use the unsharp filter or the deconvolution sharpen.\n\nWait, for spatial denoising, the bilateral filter (bilateral) is a common choice. Temporal denoising might be ttempnoisenr. Edge enhancement, unsharp is a simple and effective option. The order is important: temporal, then spatial, then edge. So the filtergraph will be a series of filters chained together.\n\nNext, I need to structure the filter chain. Using the filter_complex option, specifying each filter in sequence. The syntax would be: -filter_complex \"[0:v] ttempnoisenr=... [temp]; [temp] bilateral=... [spatial]; [spatial] unsharp=... [output]\".\n\nEach filter's options need to be filled in with typical default parameters for example. For ttempnoisenr, parameters like noise_reduction_strength. Bilateral might require parameters for sigma and spatial. Unsharp is usually used with luma_radius and luma_strength.\n\nI also need to consider if the filters are in a cascade. The output of one filter is the input to the next. So, the correct syntax is using the labels. The user hasn't specified parameters, so I should mention using placeholders and suggest adjusting them. Also, note the order: temporal first to reduce temporal noise, then spatial to smooth spatial noise, then sharpen edges to enhance.\n\nFinally, ensure the command includes the filter_complex option and then outputs the video. So the full command would be ffmpeg -i input -filter_complex \"...\" output.\n\nWait, does the ttempnoisenr require any special parameters? For example, the parameter names might be noise_size and noise_h (noise reduction strength for luma and chroma). Bilateral has luma_spatial_sigma, luma_range_sigma, etc. And unsharp's parameters are luma_radius and luma_amount.\n\nIn the example, I can include default-like values, but suggest they can be adjusted. Also, need to mention that the order is crucial for the desired effect. So the explanation would note the sequence of applying temporal first, which smooths over time, then spatial to reduce noise in each frame, then sharpen to enhance edges after noise is reduced.\n\nAssumptions here: the user wants a standard filter chain. They might need to tweak the parameters for their specific video. Also, some filters may be more effective than others depending on the content.\n</think>\n\nTo apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in sequence, chain filters with the correct order and syntax. The proper ffmpeg filtergraph uses the `ttempnoisenr` (temporal noise reduction), `bilateral` (spatial denoising), and `unsharp` (edge enhancement) filters. The filters are separated by semicolons within the `-filter_complex` option.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Temporal noise reduction first**: Reduces noise between frames (e.g., motion vectors). Typical parameter: `ttempnoisenr=16` (noise reduction strength for luma).\n2. **Spatial denoising next**: Smooths spatial noise in each frame. Example: `bilateral=25:25` (spatial and range sigma).\n3. **Edge enhancement last**: Sharpen edges after noise reduction. Example: `unsharp=5:5:2.0` (luma sharpening).\n\nThe filter chain syntax is:\n```bash\n-filter_complex \"[0:v] ttempnoisenr=16[b]; [b] bilateral=25:25:s=0.3 [c]; [c] unsharp=5:5:2.0\"\n```\n\n### Assumptions:\n- Input is video 0 (`[0:v]`).\n- Filter parameter values (e.g., `ttempnoisenr=16`, `bilateral=25:25`) are placeholders. Adjust them based on your video's noise level and desired effect strength.\n- Order: Temporal → Spatial → Edge enhancement is critical to avoid sharpening raw noise.\n\n### Command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]ttempnoisenr=16[b];[b]bilateral=25:25:s=0.3[c];[c]unsharp=5:5:2.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\nAdjust parameters as needed for your specific use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The output provided by the model generates a command that utilizes `-filter_complex` and employs correctly defined filters in a logical order, including placeholder values for those filters. There is no apparent issue with the generated command that would prevent it from functioning correctly based on the user’s request. The description explains the filters used properly and provides typical parameter values. Therefore, the output does **not** contain the described issue and should pass.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   - The output generated by the model is not similar to the failure example. The failure example provided includes an invalid preset `extra_fast` which is not a recognized option in ffmpeg, whereas the model's output does not contain any syntax or command errors and correctly invokes existing ffmpeg filters. Thus, it should pass.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Upon reviewing the command proposed in the model's output:\n     ```\n     ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]ttempnoisenr=16[b];[b]bilateral=25:25:s=0.3[c];[c]unsharp=5:5:2.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n     ```\n     The command conforms to the syntax rules outlined in the man page, specifically:\n     - The input file is correctly designated with `-i input.mp4`.\n     - The `-filter_complex` syntax is well-formed, using the correct filter labels and chaining them adequately.\n     - The output format and options are correctly specified following the input.\n     - It uses valid filters and placeholders for parameters.\n   - The command structure follows the necessary conventions, does not include any conflicting options, and respects the ordering required by ffmpeg. Therefore, the command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page and should pass.\n\nIn summary:\n- The model's output does not contain errors that would lead to failure in generating a functioning ffmpeg command.\n- The proposed command is syntactically correct and semantically appropriate according to ffmpeg's documentation. Thus, it passes all evaluation checks."
