  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the instant preset for fastest encoding",
  "output": "To convert `input.avi` into an MP4 file using the `libx264` codec with the fastest encoding preset (`instant`), we set the necessary video and audio codecs. This ensures H.264 video and AAC audio for maximum compatibility. Using `-preset instant` optimizes the encoding speed at the expense of compression efficiency.\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: specifies the use of the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset instant`: fastest available encoding speed preset in `libx264`, producing larger file sizes.\n- `-c:a aac`: specifies the use of the AAC audio codec.\n\nThe command maintains original resolution and quality unless otherwise specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset instant -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset instant -c:a aac output.mp4`) is syntactically correct and it matches the requirements from the user, as it uses the proper codec and specifies the \"instant\" preset correctly. Additionally, the explanation provided is clear and aligns with the command's parameters.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command is well-formed and does not use a non-existent preset or option. The preset \"instant\" is valid, whereas the failure example used \"extra_fast,\" which is not a valid preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements from the man page. The use of `-c:v libx264` for the video codec, `-preset instant`, and `-c:a aac` for the audio codec are all valid options, and the order of options is correct.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it should pass the evaluation. The command is valid and adheres to the requirements, producing a proper ffmpeg command based on the user's request."
