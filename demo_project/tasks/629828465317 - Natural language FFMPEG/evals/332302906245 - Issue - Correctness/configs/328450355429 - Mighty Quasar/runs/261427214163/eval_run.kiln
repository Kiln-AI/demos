  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from an input file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. The `-map 0:x` format is used to select the `x`th stream from the input file. Stream indices (x) start from 0, so the 6th video stream is `6` and the 9th audio stream is `8`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:6`: Maps the 7th (0-indexed) video stream (6th video stream) to the output.\n- `-map 0:9`: Maps the 10th (0-indexed) audio stream (9th audio stream) to the output.\n- `-c copy`: This tells `ffmpeg` to copy the streams without re-encoding to save processing time.\n- `output.mp4`: The name of the output file.\n\nThis command assumes that the video and audio streams are in standard index order. If the streams are not ordered as expected, you may need to use additional filters to reorder or select specific streams.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe command generated by the model correctly specifies mapping for the requested streams using `-map` options and uses `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate given the user's input. There are no errors in the command that would prevent it from executing successfully based on the user's requirements. Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and passes this point.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output generated does not resemble the failing output example provided (which lists an invalid preset). The model correctly identifies the stream indices and correctly constructs the `ffmpeg` command to map the desired video and audio streams. Thus, it does not fail in the same way as the example provided. The command is valid and should execute correctly, so this point also passes.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page. Specifically, it correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the streams to use in the output file, indicating both video and audio streams using their respective indexes. The command format follows the expected structure in `ffmpeg`, and it does not violate any of the rules related to input/output handling as per the synopsis and description sections of the man page. Therefore, this point also passes.\n\n4) **Final evaluation**:  \nThe model's output is appropriate and correct based on the user's input. The command uses the correct syntax and parameters required for mapping specific video and audio streams. Based on the analysis, the model's output should pass the evaluation criteria without any issues.\n\n**Evaluation Result**: Pass."
