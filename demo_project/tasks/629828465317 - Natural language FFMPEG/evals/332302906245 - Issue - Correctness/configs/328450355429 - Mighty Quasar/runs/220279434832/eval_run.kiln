  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain together a stabilization filter, apply color grading, and perform geometric transformations like rotation and scaling, we can use multiple filters in `ffmpeg`. First, we'll use the `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` to stabilize the footage, then apply the color grading with `eq`, and finally apply the `scale` and `eg` (egui) or `rotate` and `scale` for geometric transformations. For this example, let's assume we want to rotate the video by -45 degrees and scale it by 1.5 times.\n\n- `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` are used for stabilization (assuming the video already contains a calibration video to be used for stabilization).\n- `eq=lut3` is used for color grading (you can change settings to achieve the required color grades).\n- `scale=1.5` and `reg=32,33` work together to scale the video width and height respectively, while the `-1:-1` preserve the aspect ratio.\n- For rotation, since `egui` (expected geometry interface) does not support rotation, we'll use `scale` with adjusted aspect ratios, assuming some cropping might be acceptable (if a perfect rotation is not required).\n- `eq=none` indicates we start with a grayscale image before applying color grading.\n\nAssuming you have the calibration video, the calibration file name is `input.mp4`. Here's the `ffmpeg` command for this transformation:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i calibration.mp4 -filter_complex \\\n\"[1:v]eq=lut3=srgb:green=0.2,color=0.423:saturation=0.6:brightness=0.81;grayscale=none:brightness=0.0625 build=1:in=01[out][out_clip];[out_clip]scale=1.5:1:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=192:108:192:108:color=white[out_decoded][out];[out_decoded]scale='min(1920, PC)':'min(1080, 480/H)' -1:-1:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease, egui \"output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: `egui` command creates a transformed sequence with scaling and rotation, but it's not explicitly shown in the command because it would require complex setup and mathematics depending on the exact effect desired. In this provided solution, we're using a simplistic scale, assuming the geometric transformation need is not strict about rotation. Adjust rotation and cropping based on the specific content of your footage. If rotating without cropping is essential, more advanced operations combining scale, rotate, and explicit cropping are needed and `egui` might not be suitable.\n\nThe above command applies color grading using LUT before the scaling and assumes the original aspect ratio is reduced while maintaining the frame size. A more complex script might involve iterating through different scaling and crop options to find the best fit for rotation. Calculating the best rotation angle without cropping is a more complex task and may require manual tuning or custom scripting to find the best solution.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues as it generates a complex command that includes parameters that don't match the correct syntax or filter usage for `ffmpeg`. For example, `eq=lut3`, `grayscale=none`, and `egui` (not a valid filter). \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, like the one with `extra_fast`. The command generated does not have options that are outright invalid, but they are misused or incorrectly structured, leading to potential failures.\n\n3) The output breaks several requirements dictated in the man page:\n   - The command uses `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` without specifying proper input files for stabilization.\n   - Invalid filter specifications like `eq=lut3` which is improperly formatted.\n   - `egui` is not a recognized filter in `ffmpeg`, thus leading to a malformed command.\n   - Misuse of the `scale` filter, as options such as 'min' with non-numeric values and incorrect use of variables (PC, H) are inappropriate.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does indeed contain issues based on the requirements from the user. The complex command is not a valid or functional ffmpeg command as it stands due to syntax errors and misuse of filters. It would likely fail to execute and perform the desired transformations, which means it does not meet the user's needs effectively."
