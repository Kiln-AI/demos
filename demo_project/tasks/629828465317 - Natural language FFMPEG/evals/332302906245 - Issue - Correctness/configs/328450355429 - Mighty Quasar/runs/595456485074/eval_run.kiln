  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams in an `.mkv` file (video from stream index 0:3 and audio from 0:5) and create a new `.mp4` file, you can use FFmpeg’s `-map` option. Additionally, we assume you want to use H.264 video and AAC audio for compatibility with MP4.\n\n- `-map 0:v:3` selects the 4th video stream (since streams are zero-indexed) from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:5` selects the 6th audio stream.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` set the output video and audio codecs.\n- `-c copy` can be used if no re-encoding is needed, but is only compatible if all mapped streams are already H.264 and AAC respectively. Otherwise, we’ll transcode them.\n\nIf re-encoding is needed (common when converting to MP4), use the following command.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental edited.mp4\n``` \n\nAssumptions:\n1. We’re transcoding to H.264 and AAC to ensure `.mp4` compatibility.\n2. Audio encoding out of FFmpeg may require the `-strict experimental` flag if you're using a non-AC-3 audio stream. This is for older versions of FFmpeg and may no longer be needed in more recent ones. If the audio is already in a supported format (e.g., AAC), you can replace `-c:a aac` with `-c:a copy` for faster processing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \n- The output does not contain the mentioned issue. The command generated for the task specifies the proper stream mapping and uses common codecs that are compatible with the output format. The command (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental edited.mp4`) appears to perform the intended task correctly. While it does include the `-strict experimental` flag, it clarifies that it may not be necessary for newer versions of FFmpeg.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n- No, the output is not similar to the provided failure example. Unlike the failing example, the command produced by the model is valid and utilizes established parameters and codecs. The generated command is well-formed and compliant with FFmpeg's expected syntax, whereas the failure example contains an incorrect preset that does not exist.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n- The command does not break any requirements from the man page. All options and parameters used are appropriate for the task of mapping streams and creating an MP4 file. The use of `-map`, video codec (`-c:v libx264`), and audio codec (`-c:a aac`) follows the prescribed usage in the man page, and there are no contradictory options present. Although the `-strict experimental` flag may not be deemed necessary in recent versions, its inclusion does not render the command incorrect.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n- The output does not contain the issue. It accurately provides a correct and functional ffmpeg command."
