  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3, you'll want to use the libmp3lame encoder with the maximum constant bitrate (CBR), which is 320 kbps. This ensures the best possible quality for MP3.\n\n- -vn disables video recording in the output.\n- -c:a libmp3lame sets the audio encoder to MP3.\n- -b:a 320k sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (the maximum for MP3).\n- The output file will be output.mp3.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```\n\nAssumption: You want the entire audio track with the highest possible standard MP3 bitrate. If your file has multiple audio tracks and you want a specific one, you can add -map 0:a:0 to select the first audio stream.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is appropriate for extracting audio from a video file in the specified format (MP3) and bitrate (320 kbps).\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model appears to be properly structured and correctly specifies valid options for extracting audio and encoding it as an MP3 file.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options and parameters used (-i, -vn, -c:a libmp3lame, -b:a 320k) are valid. The command correctly specifies the input file and the necessary options for the desired operation (extracting audio and encoding it as MP3).\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain any issues; it successfully generates a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
