  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as ultra high resolution PNG images, you have two primary concerns: frame extraction interval and output resolution.\n\n- Extracting frames every 2 seconds means considering the timestamp or timecode. The `-vsync 1` option when combined with the `-vsync 1` filter (which can be the frame:sample filter with sample=2 for interval extraction) ensures clean timestamps.\n- Ultra high resolution means outputting at the native resolution of the input video.\n\nThe command uses the following steps:\n- `-vsync 1` enables proper frame extraction timing.\n- `-vf \"fps=1/2,scale=-2:-2\"` extracts one frame every 2 seconds and rescales it to full native resolution (without specific scaling parameters, the video native resolution is used).\n- PNG is a lossless format, so this will preserve the highest possible quality.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Replace `input=video.avi` with the correct path to your input video, and adjust the output naming pattern as desired.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"fps=1/2,scale=-2:-2\" -vsync 1 output_%05d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `fps=1/2` extracts one frame every 2 seconds (i.e., every 2 seconds).\n- `scale=-2:-2` resizes the video to its native resolution (x264 output tends to use 2^n width/height, so `-2` width and height maintain 2^n resolution).\n- Output pattern `output_%05d.png` ensures frames are numbered with 5 digits (00001.png, 00002.png, etc.).\n\nThis command efficiently extracts the requested frames at ultra high resolution.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain any mistakes in the `ffmpeg` command it generates. The command provided correctly handles frame extraction and outputs the PNG images according to the user's requirements. The explanation accompanying the command accurately describes the parameters used and their effects. This results in the command being well-formed and appropriate for the request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"fps=1/2,scale=-2:-2\" -vsync 1 output_%05d.png`) is syntactically correct and uses valid options according to the `ffmpeg` documentation. The example of a failing output uses an invalid preset option (`-preset extra_fast`), which the generated command does not.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It follows the required syntax and uses appropriate options to extract frames at specified intervals and save them as images in the desired format. There are no conflicting options or errors present in the command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue documentation. The command is correct and matches the requirements from the user, thus it passes the evaluation."
