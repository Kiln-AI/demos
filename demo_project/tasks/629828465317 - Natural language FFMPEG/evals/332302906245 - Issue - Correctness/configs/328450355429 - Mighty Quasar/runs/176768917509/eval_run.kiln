  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "To apply temporal and spatial filtering along with scaling and sharpening in ffmpeg, you combine the YADIF deinterlacer with high-quality scaling and spatial filtering via the unsharp filter.\n\n- `yadif=mode=1`: Temporal deinterlacing by removing combing and interpolating frames for progressive output.\n- `scale=1920:1080`: Resizes video to Full HD resolution, ignoring original aspect ratio (forcefully to 1920x1080).\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0`: Sharpening filter emphasizing edges for a clear picture.\n \nThe combined filter chain ensures smooth deinterlaced frames, high-quality scaling, and enhanced sharpness for maximum visual fidelity.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" -c:a copy output.ext\n```\n\n*Notes:*\n\n- Replace `input.ext` and `output.ext` with your input/output filenames and formats.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- YADIF mode 1 provides decent balance between quality and temporal smoothing.\n- Scaling with `-2` for width or height ensures proper even dimensions; use `-1` to keep the aspect ratio if you want to preserve it.\n- The sharpness level can be adjusted by `luma_amount`; 1.0 is quite aggressive.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output meets the requirements given in user input and does not exhibit any issues related to the generated ffmpeg command. The command is correctly formed and adheres to the user's request for deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening.\n\n2) The output produced by the model is not similar to the provided failure example, as the command does not contain any inaccuracies that would cause it to fail. The command uses valid filters and options correctly.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements stipulated in the ffmpeg man page. The filter chain and parameters specified (yadif for deinterlacing, scale for resizing, unsharp for sharpening) are all valid in the context of ffmpeg's capabilities.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, does not resemble a failing output, and does not break any requirements as stated in the ffmpeg man page, it should pass the evaluation.\n\nOverall, the model's output is valid and correctly responds to the user's request, effectively using appropriate ffmpeg techniques."
