  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply a brightness and contrast adjustment followed by a 1080p resize to your video using FFmpeg:\n\n- **`eq=brightness=0.2:contrast=1.2`**: Applies a brightness boost (`brightness=0.2`) and increases contrast (`contrast=1.2`). Adjust these values to suit your content (e.g., `brightness=-0.1` for dimmer output).\n- **`scale=-2:1080`**: Resizes the video to 1080 vertical resolution while preserving the aspect ratio. The `-2` ensures the width is calculated proportionally.\n- **`c:v libx264`**: Uses H.264 video codec (standard for streaming and compatibility).\n- **`pix_fmt yuv420p`**: Ensures pixel format compatibility (e.g., for web playback).\n- **`c:a aac -b:a 192k`**: Encodes audio in AAC at 192 kbps for good quality and browser compatibility.\n- **Assumptions**:\n  - Default brightness and contrast values (`0.2` and `1.2`) are used; tweak as needed.\n  - H.264 and AAC are selected for cross-platform compatibility.\n  - Input and output formats are MP4 (adjust codecs if needed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf eq=brightness=0.2:contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided correctly implements brightness and contrast adjustments followed by a scaling operation to resize the video to 1080p, adhering to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The generated command is complete and correctly formatted, utilizing valid FFmpeg options and parameters.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct syntax for chaining filters in FFmpeg and provides parameters that are valid and logically placed.\n\n4) The model's output **does not** contain the issue described. The command is valid and works correctly according to the user's requirements and follows FFmpeg's command syntax and option guidelines. Therefore, it should be marked as passing."
