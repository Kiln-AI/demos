  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a file using ffmpeg, you use the `-map` option. Streams are zero-indexed, so `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (assuming it's video) and `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (assuming it's audio), from the input file (input index 0). The output will include only these two streams.\n\nHereâ€™s the command assuming complex.avi is your input file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index 1 in video streams of input 0).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3 in audio streams of input 0).\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- Output file is named output.mkv (you can change the extension depending on desired container).\n\nIf you want to confirm stream numbers, you can run `ffmpeg -i complex.avi` first to see stream indexes.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output appears to correctly use `-map` options to extract the desired video and audio streams from the input file `complex.avi`. The `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream and `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream, which align with the user's request. The command utilizes `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate for extracting streams. There are no mistakes in the command structure or parameters, indicating that it works correctly and meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the failing example provided. The example command in the failure case contains an invalid option `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist, causing a failure due to misconfiguration. In contrast, the model's command uses valid parameters and options.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the FFmpeg man page, the command generated by the model aligns with the requirements dictated, confirming that the usage of `-map` and `-c copy` is appropriate. The options used in the output do not breach any specified requirements, and the syntax follows FFmpeg conventions.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as the command is correctly structured and valid according to the FFmpeg documentation. Therefore, it would pass the evaluation."
