  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine the video from stream 0:2 (third video stream) and audio from stream 1:3 (fourth audio stream) into a single MP4 file, use the `-map` option to specify the exact streams and `-c copy` to copy them without re-encoding. This assumes the input streams are compatible with MP4. If not, youâ€™ll need to re-encode with appropriate codecs (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC for audio).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `-map 0:v:2`: Selects the third video stream (index 2) from the first input file.  \n- `-map 0:a:3`: Selects the fourth audio stream (index 3) from the first input file.  \n- `-c copy`: Copies streams directly without re-encoding, preserving quality and reducing processing time.  \n- Assumes the input file (`recording.mov`) contains at least 3 video streams and 4 audio streams (or that the specified streams are valid). If the input streams are incompatible with MP4, replace `-c copy` with `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` for transcoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated correctly combines the specified video and audio streams into a single MP4 file. The use of the `-map` option is appropriate for selecting specific streams, and `-c copy` is correctly indicated for copying the streams without re-encoding, assuming stream compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any invalid options or non-existent presets like `extra_fast`. It correctly uses the options available to set the video and audio mappings.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, and the options used (`-map` for stream selection and `-c copy` for stream copying) are well within the capabilities outlined in the documentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's performance passes the evaluation. The output command effectively meets the user's request without any issues or errors related to syntax or compatibility."
