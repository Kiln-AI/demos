  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To specify exact video and audio bitrates for streaming, you can set `-b:v` for video bitrate and `-b:a` for audio bitrate. Here, `10000000` bits per second (10 Mbps) video bitrate and `1000k` (1000 kbps) audio bitrate are used. This will give you high-quality video and audio suited for streaming.\n\nAssuming you want to keep commonly used codecs for streaming compatibility (H.264 for video and AAC for audio) and the output format is MP4 with fast start for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000000 -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input` and `output.mp4` with your actual input and output filenames.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly specifies the command for setting the video and audio bitrates for streaming, using the appropriate flags (`-b:v` for the video bitrate and `-b:a` for the audio bitrate). The output command should work correctly, given that the input file is provided and follows the proper format. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the failure example. The failure example provided specifies an invalid preset that does not exist. In contrast, the model's output correctly uses recognized parameters and codecs, therefore it does not present a similar failing output.\n\n3) The command produced in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the man page of ffmpeg. The options used (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v libx264`, `-c:a aac`, `-movflags +faststart`) are valid according to the documentation. The output format is also compatible for streaming if using correct codex configurations.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output does not contain any of the issues described in the prompt. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
