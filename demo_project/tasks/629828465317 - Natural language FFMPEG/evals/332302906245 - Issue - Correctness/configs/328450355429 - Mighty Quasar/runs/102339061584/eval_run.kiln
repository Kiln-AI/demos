  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert a video with an alpha channel (transparency) to WebM using VP9 (which supports transparency via the `yuva420p` pixel format), you need to:\n\n- Use the `libvpx-vp9` codec for video encoding.\n- Set the pixel format to `yuva420p` to preserve the alpha channel.\n- Make sure to use a WebM container by setting the output filename to `.webm`.\n- VP9 with alpha is widely supported in modern browsers, but compatibility may vary with older software.\n\nHere’s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 output.webm\n```\n\n**Notes/Assumptions:**\n- `-auto-alt-ref 0` is required because VP9's alt-ref frames are not compatible with alpha channels.\n- Audio is omitted in the command for clarity. If you want to keep audio, add `-c:a libopus` before the output filename.\n- If your source has significant alpha, you may want to tune bitrate or quality (`-b:v` or `-crf`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model’s output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The command generated by the model appears to fulfill the user’s request of converting a video file `multitrack.mov` with an alpha channel to a WebM format using the VP9 codec, while preserving the transparency.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model uses valid options and codecs that are appropriate for the task. The codec `libvpx-vp9` and the pixel format `yuva420p` are appropriate choices for handling video with an alpha channel.\n\n3) Referring to the man page for FFmpeg, the command generated adheres to the specified requirements. It correctly uses the `-c:v libvpx-vp9` for video encoding, and `-pix_fmt yuva420p` to declare the pixel format that supports alpha channels. The use of `-auto-alt-ref 0` is also appropriate to maintain compatibility with videos containing alpha channels.\n\n4) Since the command produced by the model is appropriate and maintains correct syntax in accordance with the guidelines specified, it passes the assessment indicated in your criteria. Therefore, there are no issues with the model's output command."
