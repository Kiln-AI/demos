  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": " To transform your vertical video into a 16:9 widescreen video with blurred bars, we need to first transcode the video to the desired format, rotate it to the correct orientation, and add content-aware fills to create the blurred bars. We'll use the `-vf` flag to apply video filters.\n\nFirst filter to rotate the video from vertical to landscape orientation, assuming the vertical video to have a 9:16 aspect ratio (which usually equals approximately 5:4 in favorable cases, where video resolutions are often multiples of 1600x900):\n\n- `transpose=D` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `crop=w=16/9*h:h=h` crops the video to a 16:9 ratio.\n\nSecondly, use `extract filter complex` to create masks for the bars. We'll create two masks from the image, convert them to grayscale, apply a Gaussian blur, and then use these masks to overlay on the video.\n\n- `scale` to adjust the size of the interpolated frames for masks.\n- `extract_quad +luma +extra_pad` creates a quad that can be used as a mask for the bars.\n- `lut]` converts the quad's color to grayscale.\n- `scale` adjusts the size of the generated masks to match the video frames.\n- `mbthresh` creates thresholds to determine if a mask pixel falls on a bar line.\n- `textcolor=black` and `textcolor=white` are required to create a boolean mask; `color=rgba(255,0,0,0)` a transparent layer that will be used as a normalization layer.\n- `colorkey` sets the background to transparent where the textures (bar color) aren't present.\n- `overlay` combines the blurred bars with the target video.\n\nFinal filter expression:\n\n```\ntranspose=D:transpose=D,\ncrop=w=16/9*ih:h,\nextract_quad +luma +extra_pad,\nlut[]=xform=yuv420:[cvt0],\nscale=in_s=iw:(iw-12)*ih,\nscale=out_s=iw:ih,\nmbthresh,scale,mbthresh,\nscale,scale,\n[blur1] [blurmeq1] in[cvt0],\nlut[]=gamma=1*{r},\nlut[]=gamma=1*{g},\nlut[]=gamma=1*{b},\nscale,\n[blur1] scale=s=iw+12:n=hw,\nlut[]=gamma=0.5*{r}:gamma=0.5*{g}:gamma=0.5*{b},\nscale,\n[blurmeq1] scale=s=iw:n=hw,\ncolorkey=255,\noverlay=x=w-text_w-20:y=h-text_h,\ncolorkey=0x00ffff00\ntemp_s=w+24:h+24,\n[blurRef] u=te<blur1> pad=9:9 out<blurmeq1>,\nscale=out_s=iw:ih:flags=neighbours\noverlay=x=60:y=60:shortest=1:repeatlast=1:disposition=over\n```\n\nNow, combination of all parts into an ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.2 -preset faster -crf 23 \\\n-vf \"transpose=D:transpose=D,crop=w=16/9*ih:h,extract_quad +luma +extra_pad,lut[]=xform=yuv420:[cvt0],scale=in_s=iw:(iw-12)*ih,scale=out_s=iw:ih,mbthresh,scale,scale,mbthresh,scale,scale,[blur1] [blurmeq1] in[cvt0],lut[]=gamma=1*{r},lut[]=gamma=1*{g},lut[]=gamma=1*{b},scale,[blur1] scale=s=iw+12:n=hw,lut[]=gamma=0.5*{r}:gamma=0.5*{g}:gamma=0.5*{b},scale,[blurmeq1] scale=s=iw:n=hw,colorkey=255,overlay=x=w-text_w-20:y=h-text_h,colorkey=0x00ffff00 temp_s=w+24:h+24,[blurRef] u=te<blur1> pad=9:9 out<blurmeq1>,scale=out_s=iw:ih:flags=neighbours,overlay=x=60:y=60:shortest=1:repeatlast=1:disposition=over\" \\\n-c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nPlease note a few important assumptions and improvements:\n\n1. I assume that you want to maintain a balance between quality and file size. The `-preset faster` is chosen over `default` or `ultrafast` to balance compression efficiency with encoding speed.\n\n2. The color of the bars added at the top and bottom is set to purple (`#00ffff00`). Set this value or another color code to fit your design.\n\n3. Video editing like adding visual effects can introduce transitions and other artifacts that may or may not be desirable for your specific use case.\n\nYou may need to tweak the actual position and dimensions of the added visual effects and color to get a better match with your exact needs. Also, this operation greatly depends on having ffmpeg installed and a working build of libx264 for video encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains several issues and inaccuracies that do not correctly achieve the user's request to add blurred bars to the left and right of a vertical video to create a widescreen (16:9) aspect ratio output. The translation of requirements into command-line syntax is complex, making it more prone to mistakes. The proposed filters, such as `extract_quad`, `lut`, and specific blurring techniques are not standard or relevant for the transformation demanded and may not work as intended.\n\n2) The output resembles the example of a failing output due to its convoluted command which likely does not execute correctly with FFmpeg. While some parameters mentioned (like `-vf` and rotation) may somewhat assist in achieving the desired output, the overall filtering strategy appears overly complicated, improperly uses multiple filters, and ultimately does not specify a recognizable or executable command that would simply generate the desired effect.\n\n3) An analysis of the man page indicates that the command features many incorrect usages and parameters that are not defined or standard. For example, `extract_quad`, `mbthresh`, and the various filtering steps referenced in the command do not correspond to standard FFmpeg filter options. If any filters used do not exist or are misapplied, the command will fail, which violates the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on the issues above, the model's output indeed contains the issues described in the issue description, as it does not generate a command that would succeed without significant modification. Thus, it fails as it does not meet the requirements of generating a functional FFmpeg command to satisfy the user's request."
