  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To convert your recording.mp4 to a smaller file size quickly using the \"blazing\" preset (the fastest encoding preset available in libx264), you should use a lower CRF (constant rate factor) value for reasonable quality while maximizing speed.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-c:v libx264` to encode video as H.264.\n- Use `-preset blazing` for the fastest possible encoding.\n- Use `-crf` between 23-28: 28 will give you a smaller file and lower quality; 23 is the default for good quality/noise. Since you asked for size reduction, closer to 28 is better.\n- Encode audio as AAC for compatibility (`-c:a aac`).\n- Use `-b:a 128k` for reasonable audio quality at lower bitrate.\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` so output is web streaming friendly.\n- Keep in mind that smaller files and blazing speed will reduce quality â€” check the output to verify it meets your needs.\n\nExample assumes you want to maintain your original resolution and framerate without any resizing.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset blazing -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated should work correctly based on the user's request to reduce file size quickly using the \"blazing\" preset. The command is also logically structured and adheres to the order rules for ffmpeg options.\n\n2) The model's output isn't similar to the given failure example. The command specifies valid options and parameters that adhere to ffmpeg's requirements. It utilizes the `-preset` option correctly with \"blazing\" and provides a valid CRF range, which fits typical use cases for size reduction.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All specified options are valid, and the order of options follows the general rules. The parameters used, such as `-c:v libx264`, `-preset blazing`, `-crf 28`, and `-c:a aac`, are all appropriate for the task of converting a video to a smaller file size.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues as outlined above, it should pass the evaluation. The command meets the requirements set forth by the user regarding a smaller file size with a focus on speedy encoding, using correct syntax and valid options. Therefore, this output is acceptable."
