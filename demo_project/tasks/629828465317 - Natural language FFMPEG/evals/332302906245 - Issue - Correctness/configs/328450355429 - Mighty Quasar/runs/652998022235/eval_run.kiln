  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To convert a video file to use a **50,000 kbps (50 Mbps)** video bitrate while making it web-ready, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs. This ensures browser compatibility and includes the `-movflags +faststart` optimization for instant streaming. \n\n- `-b:v 50000k` sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps (high quality for 4K or ultra-HD content).\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes video using H.264 (browser-compatible codec).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` encodes audio using AAC with a 192 kbps bitrate (lossy but efficient for streaming).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older browsers and devices by using standard chroma subsampling.\n- `-movflags +faststart` rearranges metadata to allow browsers to start playback without downloading the full file.\n\nAssuming the input file is `input.mp4` (you can replace it with your actual file name), here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Note**: A 50 Mbps video bitrate is extremely high for typical web use. Ensure your input resolution matches this bitrate to avoid unnecessary file size bloat (e.g., 4K or higher resolutions might justify this). Adjust audio bitrate as needed (e.g., 128k for lower quality/size).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated appears to be correctly structured and matches the user's request to set the video bitrate to 50 Mbps while ensuring web compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example. The command generated by the model does not contain any invalid options or nonexistent presets. All the flags and options used in the command are valid according to the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the proper syntax, applications of options, and uses valid parameters. There are no violations of the rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output passes the evaluation by producing an appropriate and valid ffmpeg command to satisfy the user's request."
