  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To set a constant video bitrate of 25,000 kbps (25 Mbps), use the -b:v 25000k option. It is best to also explicitly set the minimum and maximum bitrate (-minrate and -maxrate) and buffer size (-bufsize) to enforce a true constant bitrate (CBR), which is often useful for broadcast or professional post-production workflows. Assume H.264/AAC encoding for compatibility.\n\nHereâ€™s how you can do this:\n\n- -b:v 25000k sets the target bitrate.\n- -minrate 25000k -maxrate 25000k keeps bitrate strictly at 25,000 kbps.\n- -bufsize 50000k sets the rate control buffer (2x bitrate is typical).\n- -c:v libx264 selects H.264 encoder.\n- -c:a copy keeps the original audio, or use -c:a aac -b:a 192k to re-encode audio if needed.\n\nReplace input.mp4 and output.mp4 with your actual filenames.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -minrate 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to re-encode audio to AAC at 192 kbps (or another rate), add `-c:a aac -b:a 192k`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output adheres to the requirements of the task, generating a command that sets a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps for the video stream as requested by the user. There are no apparent mistakes in the ffmpeg command regarding syntax or parameters.\n\n2) The output does not exhibit characteristics of a failing output similar to that in the failure example. The command includes valid options and parameters, and it seems to be structured correctly.\n\n3) The command as provided in the output does not violate any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (-b:v, -minrate, -maxrate, -bufsize, -c:v, and -c:a) are appropriate for the specified task and do not conflict with the synopsis and descriptions presented in the man page.\n\n4) As the command is correctly constructed, adheres to user requirements, and does not violate any ffmpeg man page guidelines, the model's output does **not** contain the issues described. Therefore, the model passes this evaluation."
