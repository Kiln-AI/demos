  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To chain multiple filters (such as drawtext for text overlay and boxblur for blur) in ffmpeg, use the -vf option and separate each filter with a comma. The output of one filter becomes the input to the next.\n\nExample:\n- drawtext overlays the specified text (\"Sample Text\") at coordinates x=10, y=H-40.\n- boxblur applies a blur effect (default strength if not specified).\n- Quoting the filter string prevents shell interpretation issues.\n\nAssumption: You want to blur the whole video and overlay the text on top.\nIf you want the blurred background only behind the text, the approach would be different—let me know!\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='Sample Text':x=10:y=H-40:fontcolor=white:fontsize=36,boxblur\" output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want the blur first, and then overlay the text (text appears sharp over blurred video), use:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur,drawtext=text='Sample Text':x=10:y=H-40:fontcolor=white:fontsize=36\" output.mp4\n```\nReplace the text, font settings, or adjust blur as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not contain any command errors**. The generated FFmpeg command for overlaying text and applying a blur effect has the correct syntax for chaining filters with the `-vf` option, and the filters specified (drawtext and boxblur) are valid. Therefore, it does **not** fail to generate a command that works correctly according to the user’s requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output is **not similar** to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model includes valid options and parameters, and there is no indication that the options used (such as `drawtext` and `boxblur`) are incorrect or non-existent. Hence, it does **not** fail in the same manner as the provided example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does **not break any requirements** set by the man page. It follows the correct syntax and employs valid options that are compounded in the correct manner. The filtering applies valid filter names, and there is no conflict mentioned in the FFmpeg documentation for the parameters used.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nBased on the analysis above, the model's output passes the evaluation. It does not contain issues in its command generation, aligns with FFmpeg standards, and includes appropriate filter usage. Thus, the result is a **pass**."
