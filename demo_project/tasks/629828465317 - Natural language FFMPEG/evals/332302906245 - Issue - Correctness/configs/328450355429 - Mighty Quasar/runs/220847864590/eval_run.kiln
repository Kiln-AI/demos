  "input": "Please help me encode a video with a bitrate of 2000000k to ensure maximum quality.",
  "output": "A bitrate of 2 000 000 kbps (2 000 Mbps) is vastly beyond what any common delivery codec needs or what most players can handle—it would create an **enormous** file with **no visual benefit**. For context, 4K Blu-ray peaks at ≈ 100–128 Mbps, lossless 4K ProRes at ~220 Mbps, and even visually lossless H.264/H.265 rarely exceeds 50–100 Mbps for 4K. Therefore:\n\n- If you truly want **mathematically lossless** quality, you can:  \n  – use a lossless codec such as FFV1 or x264 lossless mode (`-qp 0`) and omit a bitrate entirely.  \n  – use a high-bit-rate intra-frame mezzanine format (e.g., ProRes 4444) instead.\n\n- If you only need **visually transparent** high quality, H.265 @ ~20–40 Mbps or H.264 @ ~50–80 Mbps is already transparent for most 4K sources.\n\nAssuming you want an absolutely top-tier, visually lossless H.265 file at the **highest rate that still makes sense**, I’ll show a command capped at 100 Mbps and recommend **not** using 2 000 Mbps.\n\nExplanation of parameters  \n- -c:v libx265: H.265/HEVC encoder.  \n- -preset slower: trade encoding time for better efficiency.  \n- -x265-params lossless=1: true mathematical lossless mode (overrides the bitrate).  \n- -c:a copy: keep whatever audio track you already have untouched.\n\nIf you insist on a **lossless** encode:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset slower -x265-params lossless=1 -c:a copy output_lossless.mkv\n```\n\nIf you simply want **very high but practical quality** (~100 Mbps):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset slower -b:v 100M -c:a copy output_highquality.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nYes, the output of the model contains the issue described in the task. The command does generate a valid ffmpeg command for lossless video encoding, but it also mentions the extreme bitrate of 2,000,000 kbps without adhering to practical usage guidelines. The first output command assumes lossless encoding, which could create files that are prohibitively large and undeliverable, creating a disconnect between user expectation and practical execution.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not like the provided failing output example, which features a clear syntax error. The commands generated by the model are syntactically correct; however, they functionally suggest impractical settings.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command as suggested does not break any specific requirements from the man page. All parameters used are valid, and the commands are structured correctly for the ffmpeg usage.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the output contains the issue. While the generated commands are syntactically correct, they do not reflect practical or efficient use of ffmpeg settings, particularly with the proposed bitrate of 2000000k. Realistically, such a command would lead to excessive file sizes without any observable benefit in quality for the vast majority of use cases. The model failed to tune its recommendations toward practical usability which aligns with the user’s intended outcomes."
