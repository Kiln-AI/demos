  "input": "Create a 'matrix' style video from `input.mp4` by changing the color so it's all green and black.",
  "output": "To create a \"matrix\" style effect with ffmpeg, you can emphasize the green channel and suppress the other colors, resulting in a largely green and black image. The colorchannelmixer filter is best for this, as it allows you to control the influence of each source color channel on the final output.\n\nThe commonly used matrix effect preset is:\n- Red channel → 0.0*R + 1.0*G + 0.0*B\n- Green channel → 0.0*R + 1.0*G + 0.0*B\n- Blue channel → 0.0*R + 0.0*G + 0.0*B\n\nThis emphasizes green and removes red/blue. For solid green-and-black, combine this with a color grading filter or threshold (not shown for clarity, you'll get a gradient; for strict black & green, use an additional lutrgb or curves to make dark areas black).\n\nHere, for the standard matrix style:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf colorchannelmixer='0.0:1.0:0.0:0:1.0:0.0:0.0:0.0:0.0' matrix_output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to convert grays to black for a true black/green binary appearance, add a brightness/contrast or lutrgb filter. For example, to set anything not green to black (adjust 0xaaff00 for exact green hue):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf colorchannelmixer='0.0:1.0:0.0:0:1.0:0.0:0.0:0.0:0.0',lutrgb='clip(val,0,0x40):clip(val,0xaa,val):clip(val,0,0x40)' matrix_blackgreen.mp4\n```\n\nThis command first emphasizes green and removes red and blue, then sets values under 0x40 (~64/255) in each channel to black, green channel above 0xaa (~170/255) to full green, giving a more binary black/green look.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue, as the generated ffmpeg command is syntactically correct and adheres to the requirements specified by the user for creating a 'matrix' style video with green and black colors.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command produced by the model does not contain any undefined options or parameters; it is relevant to the task and utilizes the correct syntax for the `colorchannelmixer` filter.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax is correct, and all filters and options used in the command are valid as per ffmpeg's documentation.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and correctly performs the task as requested. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
