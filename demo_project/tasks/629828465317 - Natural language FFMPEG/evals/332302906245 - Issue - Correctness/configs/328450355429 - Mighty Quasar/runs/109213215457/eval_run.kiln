  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text on a video and apply a blur effect in ffmpeg, you first need to generate the text overlays using the ffprobe or imagemagick, or create it directly with ffmpeg using text filters. However, ffmpeg’s filterstack allows chaining filters via the format: `[filter1][filter2...]`. For example, here’s how you implement these best practices:\n\n1. First specify the video input, then optional input or image filters including the blur for video or output.\n2. Typically place video input filters before video overlays to render new overlays first.\n\nHere's a general example that overlays text over the video first, then applies a blur:\n\n- Here, I assume the original input is `input.mp4` and you have `text.txt` with the overlay text.\n- `format=squushalg=combine` helps rewrite the filterchain expression for nested filters.\n- -vf filter: Applies filters sequentially.\n- -y produces output without prompt (use safely to avoid overwrite).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"overlay=text:format=S16,blur=hrf:ratio=3:kernel=X:scale=420:420,format=squushalg=combine\" -c:a copy -map 0:a output_video_with_text_and_blur.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of filters:\n\n- `overlay=text:format=S16`: Super Sampling 16-bit integer format to reduce color banding of text.\n- `blur:hrf:ratio=3:kernel=X:scale=420:420`: Applies blur filter to the output (overlaying the video).\n- `format=squushalg=combine` aggregates filters at encode time (important for nested or chained filters).\n\nIf using external text file, the above assumes `text.txt` has the overlay text info with:\n\n`x=y w=h hpos=0` for position xx yy width height\n\n(This is basic text overlay - advanced ones require `text=overlay` syntax with font and coordinates explicitly set.)\n\nAssumptions:\n- You have text.txt formatted correctly for ffmpeg overlay.\n- Your source input is input.mp4.\n- Output container is mp4 with copy for audio (no codec change).\n\nIf you’d like, I can help with creating the text overlay text.txt or the output format changed. Just let me know.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The command generated involves incorrect filter syntax and uses non-existent filter options, which would likely lead to errors when executed.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example. While the command does have structure, the specific filters such as `format=squushalg=combine` and `blur:hrf:ratio=3:kernel=X:scale=420:420` are incorrect and do not align with the conventional ffmpeg syntax. For example, `squushalg` and `hrf` are not recognized filter options; this deviates from the expected behavior that should result in a valid command.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements dictated in the man page. The model incorrectly assumes or invents filters and parameters that do not exist in the ffmpeg documentation, which results in an improperly formed command.\n\n4) Therefore, the output contains the issue described, and it should fail given the inaccuracies and syntax errors present in the command."
