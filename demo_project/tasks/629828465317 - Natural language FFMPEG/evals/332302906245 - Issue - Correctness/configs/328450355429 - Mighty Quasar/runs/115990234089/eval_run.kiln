  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-track input and map them to the output, use the -map option. Here, -map 0:v:5 picks the sixth video stream (indexing from 0), and -map 0:a:8 selects the ninth audio stream.\n\nBy default, ffmpeg copies the stream codec, but to ensure compatibility with MP4, it's better to re-encode to H.264 video and AAC audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -map 0:v:5 -map 0:a:8 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nAssuming your input filename is \"input\" (replace with actual filename). The video stream 6 means zero-based index 5, audio stream 9 means zero-based index 8. This command encodes video and audio to formats compatible with MP4 containers.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command provided correctly maps the intended video and audio streams from the input file to create the output file, which matches the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect parameters or unsupported settings.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` to specify which video and audio streams to include in the output is correctly handled, and the codecs used (H.264 for video and AAC for audio) are appropriate for the output file format (MP4). The command is well-formed and follows the syntax specified in the documentation.\n\nOverall, the model's output is valid and meets the user's request. It successfully constructs a proper ffmpeg command based on the given input, demonstrating a good understanding of ffmpeg's stream mapping and encoding features."
