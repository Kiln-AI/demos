  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 file with a variable bitrate (VBR) locked to an average of 5000 kbps, we use the H.264 video codec and ensure the total bitrate (video + audio) is targeted. The `-b:v` flag sets the target video bitrate, while the `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` options help achieve consistent quality and enforce the desired total bitrate with VBR. We also include AAC audio encoding with a standard bitrate, assuming you want to preserve audio quality without exceeding the total bitrate.\n\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the target video bitrate to 5000 kbps.\n- `-maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k` configures VBR with a maximum allowed rate and buffer size to help stabilize the output rate.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes the video in H.264, which is widely supported in MP4.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` ensures the audio is encoded to AAC at a standard 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart` enables MP4 streaming by placing metadata at the beginning.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command it generated correctly adheres to the requirements specified by the user: converting the video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 file with a specific bitrate set to 5000 kbps using VBR.\n\n1) **First Evaluation**: The command effectively utilizes the proper syntax and options to achieve the intended transformation specified by the user. The following key parameters are correctly employed:\n   - `-b:v 5000k`: Sets the target video bitrate exactly to 5000 kbps.\n   - `-maxrate 5000k`: Caps the maximum bitrate to 5000 kbps.\n   - `-bufsize 10000k`: Configures the buffer size for VBR, ensuring a steady data rate. This helps with achieving a smooth output quality.\n   - `-c:v libx264`: Specifies the H.264 codec for encoding, which is suitable for MP4 format.\n   - `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Uses AAC audio encoding at 128 kbps, typical for good audio quality, without exceeding the combined bitrate requirement.\n\nGiven all these points, the command will successfully convert the input file meeting the user's specifications.\n\n2) **Second Evaluation**: The output does not resemble the <failure_example> since it does not contain any incorrect or invalid command parameters. It uses only valid FFmpeg options.\n\n3) **Third Evaluation**: Referring to the provided FFmpeg man page, the command follows all the requirements set forth. The use of `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` in conjunction with the codec parameters complies with the documented syntax and guidelines.\n\n4) *Final Consideration*: As per the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue detailed in the <issue_description>. It accurately generates a valid FFmpeg command consistent with the user's request, therefore it should pass the evaluation."
