  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert the MKV file to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding, we'll use the following command:\n\n- `-i movie.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` use the H.264 video and AAC audio codecs, as they are widely compatible.\n- `-preset ultrafast2` sets the encoding preset to ultrafast2, prioritizing encoding speed over file size and quality.\n- `output.mp4` specifies the output file name.\n\nAssuming the audio codec in the input file is compatible, no additional audio conversion is necessary.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset ultrafast2 output.mp4\n```\nNote: Since you want to prioritize speed over quality, be aware that the file size may be larger than if you were to use a slower preset with better compression. Also, if the audio is already in a compatible format like AAC, you might want to add `-c:a copy` to copy the audio stream without re-encoding it, which can speed up the process further:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -preset ultrafast2 output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is syntactically correct and is a valid command to convert a video file to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset. It correctly specifies the input file, the codecs for video and audio, and includes the required options in the proper order.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The ultrafast2 preset is a valid and existing preset in ffmpeg, so the command will not fail due to an invalid preset. Instead, it accurately conveys the user's request.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the order of options correctly and uses valid, supported codecs and presets. The usual requirement of options being applied to the specified output file is respected.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain an issue according to the criteria described in the evaluation steps. Hence, it passes and is deemed successful in generating the required ffmpeg command."
