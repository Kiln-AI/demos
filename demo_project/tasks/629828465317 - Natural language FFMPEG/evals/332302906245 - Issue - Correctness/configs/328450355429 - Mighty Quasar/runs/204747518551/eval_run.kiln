  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert an OGG audio file to WAV format using the Vorbis decoder with a specified sample rate, we'll use the following technique:\n\n* `-c:a libvorbis` specifies the audio decoder ( обязатель не needed here, since `libvorbis` is default  decoder for ogg vorbis encoded files), but we can explicitly set the decoder for other cases)\n* `-ar 48000` sets the sample rate to 48 kHz\n* `-c:a pcm_s16le` sets the audio codec to uncompressed 16-bit little-endian PCM, which is the standard for WAV files\n* `output.wav` specifies the output file name\n\nNote that WAV is a container format, and it's generally best to let FFmpeg automatically determine the container format based on the file extension. So we don't need to specify a container format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -ar 48000 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n```\nAssumptions: since ogg vorbis is a compressed audio codec, it does not have a fixed sample rate, but the current sample rate is upsampled to desired sample rate `48kHz`, (it will re }}/encode the audio in new sample rate).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly follows the user's request to convert `audio.ogg` to WAV format at a sample rate of 48kHz using the PCM audio codec.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The provided command is valid and will not produce an error. However, the note regarding the redundancy of specifying `libvorbis` in this context is somewhat misleading, but does not lead to an invalid command.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies the input and output files, as well as the audio codec and sample rate according to the appropriate usage and conventions outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the output does **not** contain any issues, the evaluation should be considered a **pass**. The ffmpeg command generated is correct and matches the user's requirements for converting an OGG audio file to WAV format."
