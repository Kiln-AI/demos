  "input": "I want to convert my video.avi to MOV format using the nvenc_h265 encoder with ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert `video.avi` to MOV format using NVIDIA's HEVC hardware encoder (`hevc_nvenc`) with the `ultrafast` preset. The encoder produces a `.mov` container (QuickTime format) with HEVC video. Audio stays unchanged unless a codec is specified. Assumes your system has NVENC hardware support and the driver is installed, and that FFmpeg was compiled with `hevc_nvenc` support. You likely want the audio codec to be compatible with MOV files, so here I’m sticking with the original audio (or re-encoding to AAC if necessary).\n\nThe `hevc_nvenc` encoder supports presets like `ultrafast`, but lacks a full CRF mode similar to x265; instead, you can use `-cq` or `-b:v` to control quality. Since you want ultrafast, I’ll use `-cq 28` (similar to CRF 23 in x265, adjust as needed).\n\n````bash\nffmpeg -hwaccel auto -i video.avi -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset ultrafast -cq 28 -c:a copy output.mov\n````",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to correctly convert the specified video file into the desired MOV format using the specified `nvenc_h265` encoder and `ultrafast` preset. The command aligns with the user's request, and the explanation provides sufficient context.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is valid and employs existing parameters and codecs correctly. The `ultrafast` preset is recognized with the `hevc_nvenc` encoder.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It specifies the input file, output container format, and all codec choices conform to expected usage. Using `-c:a copy` indicates that the audio stream will be copied without re-encoding, which is appropriate.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain any issues and successfully meets the user’s request. Therefore, it should be marked as passing."
