  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific audio and video streams from a multi-stream file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. This option allows you to explicitly choose which streams to include in the output file. Here, we are mapping video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the input file `recording.mkv` to the output file.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The numbering of streams starts from 0.\n- The file `recording.mkv` contains at least 12 video streams and 25 audio streams.\n\nHere's the appropriate `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -map 0:25 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i recording.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:12` selects video stream 12 from the input file (0 is the index for the input file).\n- `-map 0:25` selects audio stream 25 from the input file.\n- `output.mp4` is the name of the output file.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command provided is correctly formatted and should work as intended, selecting the specified video and audio streams without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not contain any mistakes or nonexistent options, unlike the provided `failure_example`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax, utilizes the `-map` option appropriately for selecting streams, and does not violate any order or option application rules.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, so it passes the evaluation. The command accurately represents the intended user request and adheres to the specifications outlined in the ffmpeg documentation."
