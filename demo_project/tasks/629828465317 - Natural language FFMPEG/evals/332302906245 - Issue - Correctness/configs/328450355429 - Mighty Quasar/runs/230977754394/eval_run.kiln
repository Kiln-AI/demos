  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to reduce the size of video.mp4 to make it easier to email. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main goal is to decrease the file size. There are several ways to do this with ffmpeg. One common method is to lower the video bitrate. Bitrate directly affects file size, so reducing it will make the file smaller. But I need to balance that with maintaining acceptable quality.\n\nAnother factor is the resolution. If the video is higher than necessary, scaling it down can help. But the user didn't mention changing the resolution, so maybe they want to keep it as is. But maybe I can suggest scaling if needed. However, since they didn't specify, perhaps it's better to focus on bitrate and codec settings.\n\nThe video codec is important. If the original is using a less efficient codec like ProRes or AVI, switching to H.264 or H.265 (HEVC) can reduce size. But H.265 might not be supported by all email clients, so H.264 is safer. Also, using a lower bitrate for H.264.\n\nAudio bitrate can also be reduced. If the audio is high quality, lowering it to 64-128 kbps might help without much loss. Also, changing the audio codec to AAC instead of something like AC3 or MP2 could be more efficient.\n\nAnother option is to use the -crf option with libx264. CRF (Constant Rate Factor) controls quality, where lower numbers mean better quality. The default is 23, but increasing it to 28 might reduce size. However, the user might not notice much difference. Alternatively, setting a specific bitrate with -b:v.\n\nAlso, ensuring that the container is efficient. MP4 with H.264 is standard, so maybe the original is already in MP4. But sometimes, using a different container might not help much.\n\nI need to make sure the command is effective. Let me structure the command. Let's start with the input file, then set the video codec to libx264, adjust the CRF, maybe set a lower audio bitrate, and use a preset for encoding speed. Also, using -movflags +faststart for streaming, but if the user just wants to email, maybe that's not necessary. But including it might help with some email clients.\n\nWait, the user is emailing, not streaming. So maybe the faststart isn't as critical. But it's safe to include. However, the main focus is on reducing size.\n\nLet me outline the parameters:\n\n- Video codec: libx264\n- CRF: 28 (higher than default 23) to lower quality, thus reducing size\n- Audio codec: aac, bitrate 64k\n- Preset: medium or fast for quicker encoding\n- Maybe scale the video if needed, but since the user didn't mention, perhaps not.\n\nBut the original file is video.mp4. If it's already in H.264, maybe changing CRF and audio bitrate is sufficient. If it's another codec, converting to H.264 would help.\n\nBut the user's original command may not have specified codecs. So the command should assume that the input is in a format that can be converted to H.264.\n\nSo the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 64k -preset medium output.mp4\n\nBut also, maybe using a lower resolution. But without knowing, maybe it's better to not assume. Alternatively, mention that if the user wants to scale, they can add the scale filter.\n\nBut the user's main request is to make it smaller, so focusing on bitrate and codec. Another option is to set a specific bitrate, like -b:v 1M for video. But CRF is more efficient for quality control. However, if the user wants to reduce size, CRF 28 might be better than a fixed bitrate.\n\nAlso, using -movflags +faststart is optional but can be included for compatibility.\n\nWait, the user might not need the faststart. So the main command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 64k -preset medium -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n\nBut also, check if the original has audio. If the original has a different audio codec, converting to AAC would help. So the command includes -c:a aac to ensure that.\n\nBut the user might not want to lose audio quality, so 64k is a lower bitrate. Maybe 128k is better but still lower than original. But the user said it's too big, so reducing as much as possible.\n\nAlso, maybe the original has a higher resolution. If the user wants to scale down, but since they didn't mention, maybe it's better to not include that unless specified.\n\nAssumptions: The original video is in a format that can be converted to H.264. The user wants to maintain the aspect ratio. The user is okay with a slight reduction in quality.\n\nSo the final command would include CRF 28, lower audio bitrate, and use H.264. Also, maybe mention that if they want to scale, they can add scale parameters.\n\nBut the user didn't mention scaling, so the command focuses on codec and bitrate adjustments.\n</think>\n\nTo reduce the size of `video.mp4` while maintaining reasonable quality, we'll use H.264 video encoding (efficient for file size), lower the video quality with `-crf 28` (higher = lower quality), reduce the audio bitrate, and optimize encoding speed with the `medium` preset. This balances quality and file size for email-friendly sharing.\n\n- `-crf 28`: Reduces video quality (vs default 23) to shrink file size.  \n- `-preset medium`: Balances encoding speed and compression efficiency.  \n- `-c:a aac -b:a 64k`: Uses efficient AAC audio at a low bitrate (64 kbps).  \n- `-movflags +faststart`: Prepares the file for faster loading in some email clients.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 64k -movflags +faststart reduced_video.mp4\n```  \n\n**Note:** If the file is still too large, consider further reducing `-crf` (e.g., `29`) or scaling resolution (`-vf scale=1280:720`). Always back up the original file before modifying!",
