  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the original video stream and select only the third audio track from the input file, you can use the `-map` option. The first input's video stream is typically `0:v:0`, and the third audio stream is `0:a:2` (because streams are zero-indexed). This command copies both without re-encoding, preserving original quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy streams without re-encoding.\n- Output is saved as `output.mkv` to avoid overwriting the original.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated is appropriate for the user’s request and successfully maps the original video and the specified audio track without re-encoding. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command generated by the model correctly follows the syntax of the `ffmpeg` command line tool and does not contain any non-existent options or errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specific video and audio streams, and the codec copy options are suitable for preserving the original quality of the streams.\n\n4) Considering the above,\n\nThe model's output should pass; it does not contain the issues specified and successfully fulfills the user’s requirements with an accurate and valid command."
