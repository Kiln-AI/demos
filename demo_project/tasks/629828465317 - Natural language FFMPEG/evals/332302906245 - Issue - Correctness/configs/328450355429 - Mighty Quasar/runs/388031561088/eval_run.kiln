  "output": "To transform input.mp4 to MKV using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copy the video stream, you should:\n\n- Use FFmpeg's `-c:v` option with `libx265` to encode video.\n- Use `-preset veryslow` to select the veryslow encoding preset.\n- Use `-crf` to control the quality (lower means better quality, default 23 is common; adjust as needed).\n- Use `-c:a copy` to copy the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Use `.mkv` as the container format: Matroska is a widely supported container that supports x265 encoded video streams.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to keep the existing video quality (`crf` not set; adjust if you want to change quality, e.g., `crf 18` for higher quality).\n- Audio codec copied without change.\n- Output file will be named `output.mkv`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command efficiently converts the input video to MKV using x265 with the veryslow preset for high compression efficiency, and retains the original audio without quality loss.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command matches the requirements from the user message appropriately by using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset while copying the audio stream without re-encoding. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output as it correctly employs the options and has no invalid option specified. \n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All the options used in the command (`-c:v libx265`, `-preset veryslow`, `-crf 23`, `-c:a copy`) are valid and follow the expected syntax and order.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and therefore, it should **pass**."
