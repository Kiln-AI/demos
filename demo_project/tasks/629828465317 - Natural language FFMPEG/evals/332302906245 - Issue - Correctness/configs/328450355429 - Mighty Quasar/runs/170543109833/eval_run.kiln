  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map the third video stream (index 2) and the second audio stream (index 1) from `multi.avi` into `final.mp4`, use the `-map` option to explicitly select these streams. This ensures only the specified streams are included in the output. Note that the output format (MP4) will default to compatible codecs (e.g., H.264 for video, AAC for audio), but you can override this if needed.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The source file `multi.avi` contains at least three video streams and two audio streams.\n- Stream indices are 0-based (third video is `0:v:2`, second audio is `0:a:1`).\n- No re-encoding is required unless specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 final.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to enforce specific codecs (e.g., H.264 video, AAC audio) or adjust settings, add parameters like `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams, and seems to align with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output because the command it generated does not contain any invalid parameters or options. The mapping is done correctly for the specified streams in a proper format.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the proper format for mapping the streams, and there are no invalid options used. The assumptions made regarding the stream indices and that the input file contains the requisite streams are reasonable and consistent with standard practices in FFmpeg.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output meets the criteria and does not contain any issues. It provides a valid and appropriate command reflecting the user's request correctly. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
