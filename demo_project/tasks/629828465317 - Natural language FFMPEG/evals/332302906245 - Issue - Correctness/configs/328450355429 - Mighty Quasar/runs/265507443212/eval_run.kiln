  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add a watermark to their video. Let me think about how to approach this with ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, they mentioned adding a watermark image to the bottom left corner. I remember that ffmpeg has a filter called overlay which can be used for this. The logo.png is the image they want to overlay. Since they want it in the bottom left, I need to set the x and y coordinates appropriately. But wait, the exact position might depend on the video's resolution. Maybe using percentages or relative positions would be better. Alternatively, using 'main_w' and 'main_h' variables to position it relative to the video size.\n\nThey also mentioned the watermark should be semi-transparent. That means adjusting the opacity. The overlay filter has an 'overlay' option where you can specify the opacity. The 'format=alpha' might be needed to handle transparency, and then using the 'alphaextract' or 'alphamerge' filters. Wait, perhaps using the 'overlay' with an 'enable' expression and setting the opacity via the 'opacity' parameter. Or maybe using the 'overlay' filter with the 'format=rgba' and then adjusting the alpha channel.\n\nWait, I think the correct approach is to use the 'overlay' filter with the 'format=rgba' to ensure the image's alpha channel is considered. Then, using the 'opacity' parameter in the overlay filter to set the transparency. For example, overlay='0:0' would place it at the top-left, but since they want it in the bottom left, maybe 'main_w - logo_w : main_h - logo_h'? But that might be for the bottom right. Alternatively, setting the x and y positions to 0 and main_h - logo_h to place it at the bottom left.\n\nWait, the user might not have specified the exact position, just the bottom left. So using 'main_w - logo_w' for x to align it to the left? Wait, no. To position it at the bottom left, the x-coordinate should be 0 (left side) and the y-coordinate should be main_h - logo_h (so it sits at the bottom). But how to handle that in the overlay filter. The syntax for overlay is x:y, so maybe '0:main_h - logo_h'.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the logo's dimensions are considered. Also, the user mentioned semi-transparent, so the opacity parameter. The overlay filter has an 'opacity' option, which takes a value between 0 and 1. So setting that to 0.5 for 50% transparency.\n\nPutting this together: the filter command would be something like 'overlay=0:(main_h - logo_h):enable=0:0' but I need to check the correct syntax. Wait, the 'overlay' filter's parameters are x, y, [format], [opacity]. Maybe the correct way is to use 'overlay=0:(main_h - logo_h):format=rgba:opacity=0.5'.\n\nBut I also need to make sure that the image's alpha channel is preserved. So perhaps using the 'format=rgba' in the overlay filter. Also, the 'alphabool' might be needed if the logo has an alpha channel. Alternatively, using 'alphaextract' to get the alpha channel and then combining it with the video.\n\nWait, maybe the process is: convert the logo to rgba, then overlay with opacity. So the filter chain would include 'overlay' with the logo.\n\nAlternatively, using the 'overlay' filter with the image, specifying the position, and adjusting the opacity. Let me check some references.\n\nAnother thing: the user's input is avi, which might have different pixel formats. To ensure compatibility, maybe using 'pix_fmt=yuv420p'.\n\nPutting all together, the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:(main_h - ih):format=rgba:opacity=0.5\" output.mp4\n\nWait, the 'ih' refers to the height of the logo image. But how to express that in the filter. Maybe using 'main_h - logo_h' but how to get the logo's height. Alternatively, using 'main_h - h' where h is the height of the watermark image. But in the filter, variables like 'h' refer to the height of the input video. Wait, no. The variables in the overlay filter are: 'main_w', 'main_h' for the video's dimensions, and 'w', 'h' for the overlay's dimensions.\n\nSo, for the y position: main_h - h (where h is the height of the watermark image). So the y coordinate would be 'main_h - h'. But how to represent that in the filter. So the overlay parameters would be x=0:y=main_h - h. Therefore, the filter would be 'overlay=0:(main_h - h):format=rgba:opacity=0.5'.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the filter_complex is correctly set up. Also, the user might need to adjust the position based on the logo's size. Alternatively, using a fixed position. But since they didn't specify the exact size, using main_h - h is better for dynamic positioning.\n\nSo the full command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:(main_h - h):format=rgba:opacity=0.5\" output.mp4\n\nBut wait, the 'h' refers to the height of the overlay image (logo.png). So the y coordinate is main_h (video's height) minus the logo's height. That would position the logo at the bottom left, with its bottom edge aligned to the video's bottom edge.\n\nBut maybe the user wants the logo to be in the bottom left corner, so perhaps the x is 0 and the y is main_h - logo_h. So the filter expression would be overlay=0:(main_h - h). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Also, the opacity is set to 0.5 for semi-transparent.\n\nAnother consideration: the logo.png might need to be in a format that supports transparency, like PNG. The user provided it as logo.png, which should be fine.\n\nAdditionally, ensuring that the output format is suitable. The user's input is avi, but outputting to mp4 is fine. Using the default codec for mp4, which is h.264. So the command should work.\n\nSo the final command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:(main_h - h):format=rgba:opacity=0.5\" output.mp4\n\nBut I need to check if the 'h' in the overlay expression refers to the height of the logo. Yes, in the overlay filter, 'h' is the height of the overlay (second input). Therefore, the y position is main_h (video's height) minus the logo's height, placing it at the bottom.\n\nAnother thing: the 'format=rgba' ensures that the overlay uses the alpha channel, which is necessary for transparency. Without that, the image might be treated as a solid color, and the transparency wouldn't be applied.\n\nTherefore, the explanation would need to mention these points. The user might not know that the format needs to be set to rgba, so including that is important.\n\nSo the answer should include the command with the overlay filter, the position, format, and opacity. Also, mention that the logo should have an alpha channel for transparency, and that the position is at bottom left.\n</think>\n\nTo add a semi-transparent watermark to the bottom left corner of your video, use the `overlay` filter with the image file (`logo.png`) and adjust transparency using the `opacity` parameter. The watermark image should be in a format that supports transparency (e.g., PNG).\n\n- `overlay=0:(main_h - h)` places the watermark at the bottom left by calculating its position relative to the video’s height (`main_h`) and the image’s height (`h`).\n- `format=rgba` ensures the image’s alpha channel is preserved for transparency.\n- `opacity=0.5` sets semi-transparency (adjust as needed).\n- The watermark image (`logo.png`) is expected to have an alpha channel for proper transparency.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=0:(main_h - h):format=rgba:opacity=0.5\" output.mp4\n```",
