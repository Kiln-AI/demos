  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "You want to encode a video with a specific bitrate and high-quality audio. Here's how you can do it, specifying the video bitrate and audio bitrate for studio quality.\n\n- The `-b:v` option sets the video bitrate. A higher bitrate generally results in better video quality, but also a larger file size.\n- The `-b:a` option sets the audio bitrate. 2048 kbps is a high bitrate suitable for studio quality audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 2048k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 2048k output.mp4`) is valid and matches the user's request to set the video bitrate to 8000k and the audio bitrate to 2048k. There are no errors or unsupported options in the command as described by the user requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The generated command is syntactically correct and uses valid ffmpeg options. There are no invalid options like `extra_fast` in the output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options `-b:v` and `-b:a` are correctly applied to set the desired video and audio bitrates for the output file. The input format is also respected, and the order of options is consistent with the ffmpeg usage guidelines.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described, it passes the evaluation. The command is valid, properly generated, and aligns with user requirements."
