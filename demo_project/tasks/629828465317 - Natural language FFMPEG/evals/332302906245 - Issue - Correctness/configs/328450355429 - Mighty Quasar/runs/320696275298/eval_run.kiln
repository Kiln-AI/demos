  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode subtitles into `movie.mkv` and ensure the subtitles are yellow, you need to use the `subtitles` filter in `ffmpeg`. The `colormatrix` parameter allows you to change the color of the subtitles. The provided values will change the subtitle color to yellow.\n\nHere is the command to achieve this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontName=Arial,FontColor=yellow,BackGroundColor=Transparent,BorderColor=Transparent,Outline=0'\" -c:s mov_text output.mkv\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-i movie.mkv`: Specifies the input video file.\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='FontName=Arial,FontColor=yellow,BackGroundColor=Transparent,BorderColor=Transparent,Outline=0'\"`: The video filter (`-vf`) specifies that subtitles should be added to the video. The `subtitles` filter accepts the path to the subtitle file (`subtitles.srt`) and additional styling options (`force_style`). \n  - `FontName=Arial`: Sets the font name to Arial.\n  - `FontColor=yellow`: Sets the color of the subtitles to yellow.\n  - `BackGroundColor=Transparent`: Ensures the background of the subtitles is transparent.\n  - `BorderColor=Transparent`: Ensures the border around the subtitles is transparent.\n  - `Outline=0`: Ensures there is no outline around the subtitles.\n- `-c:s mov_text`: Specifies that the subtitles should be hard-coded as a MOV text stream.\n- `output.mkv`: Specifies the output file name.\n\nIf you do not prefer Arial, you can replace `Arial` with another preferred font, as long as the font is available on your system.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described because it correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command for hardcoding subtitles into a video file using the `subtitles` filter and also formats the subtitles to be yellow. The parameters used in the command are valid and align with the user requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is well-structured and utilizes appropriate parameters for adding subtitles, while the failure example includes a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), which the model did not include in its command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It follows the correct syntax for applying filters, specifying input and output files, and using valid options consistent with the function of adding subtitles correctly.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and therefore passes the evaluation. It successfully produces a correct `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's specifications for hardcoding subtitles in yellow color."
