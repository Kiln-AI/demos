  "input": "Convert my video using a bitrate of 25000k for video and 320k for audio to balance quality and size.",
  "output": "To convert your video using specific bitrates for quality/size balance, I'll use constant bitrate encoding with H.264 video at 25 Mbps and AAC audio at 320 kbps.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding\n- `-b:v 25000k` sets video bitrate to 25 Mbps (high quality)\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio encoding\n- `-b:a 320k` sets audio bitrate to 320 kbps (high quality audio)\n- `-preset medium` balances encoding speed and compression efficiency\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\nI'm assuming you want MP4 output format and that your input video doesn't need resolution changes. If you need a different output format or have specific resolution requirements, let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 320k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output generated by the model does not contain any issues related to incorrect ffmpeg command syntax or parameters. The command is correctly formulated to convert the video with specified bitrates for both video and audio. The explanation provided aligns well with the user's requirements regarding quality and size balance.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The output from the model is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any non-existent options or incorrect syntax that would cause it to fail. The preset used (medium) is a valid option in ffmpeg.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command adheres correctly to the requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. All options used (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-preset`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, `-pix_fmt`) are valid and follow the correct syntax. Moreover, the order of options is preserved as per the guidelines.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. It effectively generates a correct and functional ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements without any errors or invalid parameters. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
