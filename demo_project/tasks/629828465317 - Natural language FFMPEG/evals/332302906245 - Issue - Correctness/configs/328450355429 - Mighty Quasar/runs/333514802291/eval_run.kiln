  "output": "To combine video from input stream 0:2 and audio from input stream 1:3 into an MP4 file, youâ€™ll instruct FFmpeg to select specific streams using the -map option, and encode them appropriately. The video is encoded as H.264 (libx264) and the audio as AAC, both of which are widely compatible with MP4 and browser playback.\n\n- -map 0:2 selects the third video stream (stream numbering always starts at 0).\n- -map 1:3 selects the fourth audio stream.\n- -c:v libx264 makes sure the video is in H.264/AVC format.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k ensures AAC audio coding at 128kbps.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p guarantees compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes MP4 for web playback (mov.flags +faststart).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will create a browser and device-friendly MP4 using your specified video and audio streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue. The command accurately reflects the user's request to combine specific video and audio streams from a given input file into a single output file. The inclusion of the `-map` options and the chosen codecs (libx264 for video and AAC for audio) are appropriate for creating a compatible MP4 file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command is well-formed and does not contain any non-existent options or incorrect parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It adheres to the structure and syntax stipulated, including the correct use of `-map`, codec selection, and output specification.\n\n4) Since the model's output passes all evaluations and does not contain any issues, it can be concluded that the model performed well in this instance and successfully generated a valid FFmpeg command that matches the user's requirements."
