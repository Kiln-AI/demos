  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove audio without re-encoding the video, you can copy the video stream as-is and discard the audio stream. This is done using `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream directly and `-an` to disable audio in the output. This approach is lossless for video since no re-compression occurs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output_no_audio.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output_no_audio.mp4`) accurately removes the audio from the video file without re-compressing the video stream, which meets the user's requirement of not re-compressing the video stream. The explanation provided is clear and correct.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and properly uses existing ffmpeg options. There are no incorrect options or parameters present that would cause it to fail, unlike the example of using a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-c:v copy` to indicate that the video stream should be copied as-is and using `-an` to disable the audio is compliant with the ffmpeg command syntax and options described in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it successfully generates a correct command that meets the user's requirements without re-compressing the video stream. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
