  "input": "Convert audio.wav to MP3 format using the fastest preset available",
  "output": "To convert `audio.wav` to MP3 quickly, use the `libmp3lame` encoder with the `-q:a 2` for good quality (lower is better; range is 0-9), and add `-compression_level 0` for the fastest mp3 encoding. By default, ffmpeg uses fast settings, but `-compression_level` explicitly controls speed/quality tradeoff with libmp3lame (0 is fastest, 2 is default, 9 is slowest/best quality).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.wav -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 -compression_level 0 output.mp3\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want reasonably good quality at the fastest encoding speed.\n- If you want even faster and donâ€™t care about file size, increase `-q:a` value (e.g., 5), but 2 is generally transparent for most music.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is syntactically correct and meets the user's requirement of converting `audio.wav` to MP3 format using the `libmp3lame` encoder.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command includes valid options and parameters for `ffmpeg`. There are no incorrectly named presets or options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the options for audio conversion, including the codec and quality settings. The parameters used are valid for the context of the task.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes as it generates a functional command that fulfills the user's request without any errors or invalid parameters."
