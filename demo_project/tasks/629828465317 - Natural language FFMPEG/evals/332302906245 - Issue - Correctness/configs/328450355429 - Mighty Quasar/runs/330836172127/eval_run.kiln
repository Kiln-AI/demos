  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio filters - normalize volume, remove noise, and add a fade in/out effect. Can you show me the filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple audio filters in sequence, you'll use the `-af` (audio filter) parameter with filters separated by commas. This creates a filter chain where audio passes through each filter in order: volume normalization, noise reduction, and fade effects.\n\nFor your specific requirements:\n- `dynaudnorm` normalizes volume dynamically\n- `afftdn` removes noise using spectral subtraction\n- `afade` adds fade in and fade out effects\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2;afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n```\n\nThe filter chain applies:\n1. Dynamic audio normalization to even out volume levels\n2. FFT denoising with noise reduction factor of 10\n3. 2-second fade in starting at 0 seconds, followed by 2-second fade out starting at 58 seconds (adjust timing based on your audio length)\n\nThe semicolon separates the two fade filters since they're both `afade` filters with different parameters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated appears to correctly implement the requested audio filters (volume normalization, noise removal, and fade effects) as per the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model follows the correct syntax for the `ffmpeg` tool and includes valid filter names and parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses valid filters (dynaudnorm, afftdn, and afade) appropriately chained together using the `-af` option. The separator for different parameters is correct (commas for different filters and semicolons for different instances of the same filter).\n\n4) Given that the model's output is valid and correctly applies the user's request without issues, **the evaluation should pass**."
