  "input": "Convert my file.mp4 to WebM format using the vp8 codec with the veryslow preset",
  "output": "To convert `file.mp4` to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the `veryslow` preset, you need to:\n\n- Specify the VP8 codec via `-c:v libvpx` and choose input-compatible format `-b:v` (VP8 requires baseband bitrate in bits per pixel; here we use 1.5 Mbps for example).\n- Use the `-preset veryslow` option to activate the slow encoding algorithm which emphasizes compression quality over speed or smaller sizes.\n- Set the output container as `webm` with `.webm` extension.\n- Optionally, specify audio codec and bitrate for compatibility.\n\nHere is the command with default VP8 bitrate (2 Mbps) and a typical input-compatible format for the VP8 codec:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 800k -preset veryslow -c:a libopus -b:a 128k file.webm\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx`: selects the VP8 codec inside the WebM container.\n- `-b:v 800k`: sets the video bitrate in kilobits per second (adjust if needed).\n- `-preset veryslow`: controls encoding speed vs. compression.\n- `-c:a libopus`: selects the Opus audio codec, which is widely compatible with WebM.\n- `-b:a 128k`: sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\nMake sure your ffmpeg build has VP8 support. On many systems, `libvpx` is available by default, but you might need `libvpx-vp9` or `libx265` if VP8 is missing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated is valid and should function correctly, meeting the user's requirements for converting the media file to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the `veryslow` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. While the model could have faced issues, such as incorrect options or unsupported features, the produced command aligns with what is acceptable and does not contain any unsupported or erroneous presets.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictating in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly specifies the input file `file.mp4`, uses the appropriate video codec with `-c:v libvpx` for VP8, and applies the specified preset, `-preset veryslow`. The output file format is also set to `.webm`, which is standard for files encoded with VP8.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation as the command generated meets the specifications and does not break any requirements according to the FFmpeg documentation."
