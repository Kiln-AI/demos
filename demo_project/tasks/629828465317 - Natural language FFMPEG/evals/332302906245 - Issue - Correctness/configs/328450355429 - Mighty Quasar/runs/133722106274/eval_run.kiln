  "input": "I want to apply a complex video filter chain to add a watermark and adjust brightness. Use -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' to resize, add watermark, and brighten the video.",
  "output": "To apply a complex filter chain using `-vf` with three chained filters:\n1. `-vf scale=1280:720` resizes the input video to 1280x720 (standard 1080p HD). Make sure your input is at least 1280x720 or the scaling will upsample the input.\n2. `,overlay=10:10:watermark.png` overlays watermark.png image at the top-left corner (x:10, y:10), resizing it to the input resolution automatically (overlays center the image on the position; you can adjust the coordinates).\n3. `,brightness=0.2` applies a brightness adjustment where 1.0 is no change and 0.0 sets the video to black. -0.2 means medium-darkness.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- You have a watermark.png image at the root of your working directory; adjust the path if necessary (full path required).\n- input video is input.mp4.\n- Output is output.mp4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\nThis command applies the filter chain to your video while copying the original audio stream without re-encoding (`-c:a copy`). If your watermark.png is not named watermark.png and is located elsewhere, modify the filename and path accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command follows the guidelines for constructing a valid ffmpeg command and applies the correct transformations as specified by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The output command contains proper syntax and valid parameters for the ffmpeg functionality being used. It does not contain any erroneous or non-existent parameters.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used (`-vf`, `-i`, and `-c:a copy`) are valid and used correctly following ffmpeg's syntax. The command correctly specifies the input file, applies a video filter, and sets the audio codec options appropriately.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation:**\n   - **Pass**: The modelâ€™s output effectively completes the task specified, adhering to the user requirements and the ffmpeg command structure without any errors or invalid options."
