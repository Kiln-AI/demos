  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to apply temporal and spatial filters together using specific ffmpeg filters. Let me break down their request.\n\nThey mentioned using the -vf chain with yadif for deinterlacing, then scale to 1920x1080, and unsharp for sharpening. I need to make sure the filters are correctly ordered. First, deinterlacing should come before scaling and sharpening. The yadif filter is for deinterlacing, mode 1 is default, which should be the temporal smoothing option. Then scaling to 1920x1080. The user specified the exact width and height, so I should use that instead of -2. The unsharp filter parameters look correct for luma sharpening. \n\nWait, the user's filter chain includes yadif, scale, unsharp. The order is correct because deinterlacing should happen first, then scaling, then sharpening. The -movflags +faststart is a common addition for streaming, so I'll include that. Also, ensuring the pixel format is yuv420p for compatibility. The codecs should be libx264 for video and aac for audio. Need to check if the user has an output file in mind. Since the example output uses output.mp4, I'll follow that. Let me structure the command with all these elements, making sure the filterchain is properly enclosed in single quotes. Also, the user might not need any specific presets or crf if they didn't mention, so using -preset fast and -crf 23 as defaults. Audio bitrate 128k is standard. \n\nSo the command would be: ffmpeg -i input -vf \"yadif=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma...\" with all the parameters, then codecs and -movflags. Check for any syntax issues like quotes and commas. The user's filter string is in single quotes, so in the command, it's double quotes to avoid issues with spaces. Should also add -pix_fmt yuv420p to ensure compatibility. Alright, that should cover everything the user asked for.\n</think>\n\nTo apply deinterlacing, scaling to 1920×1080, and sharpening in a single filterchain, the filters are chained in the order deinterlacing → scaling → sharpening. This ensures deinterlacing happens before scaling and sharpening to avoid artifacts.\n\n**Key points:**\n- `-vf \"yadif=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\"` sets the required filters.\n  - `yadif=1` applies temporal deinterlacing (mode 1 is default, but explicitly set here for clarity).\n  - `scale=1920:1080` forces exact output resolution (no aspect ratio prescaling here since the user specified fixed dimensions).\n  - `unsharp` sharpening uses 5×5 luma kernel with +100% sharpness.\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23` balances quality and speed.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with most players.\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows streaming from the start of the file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is a video file (`.avi`, `.mkv`, etc.) with interlaced content.\n- Output is an MP4 for compatibility.\n- Audio is re-encoded to AAC 128k unless you have a preference.\n- No original audio flags specified, so default AAC encoding is used.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output based on the steps provided:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output appears to create an appropriate ffmpeg command that matches the user's request for applying multiple filters (deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening). The output does not show any evident mistakes regarding the ffmpeg command generation. Therefore, it does not contain the described issue.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The model's output is not similar to the failing example given, as it correctly formats a command that includes valid parameters and options that are recognized by ffmpeg. It constructs the command properly, including codec specifications and other necessary options for a valid transformation.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The generated command does not break any requirements stated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used are valid based on the functionality described in the man page. The command execution order and parameter settings are appropriate. The options such as filter chain, codec choices, pixel format, and output settings comply with the specified syntax and requirements.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Since the model's output is valid, structured correctly, and adheres to all specifications from the man page, it should pass the evaluation as it does not contain any issues. Thus, it does not fail based on the criteria outlined. \n\n**Conclusion:** The model's output is correct and does not contain any issues as described in the task evaluation criteria."
