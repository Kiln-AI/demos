  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from the input file `broadcast.mkv` and save them as a new MP4 file `trimmed.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option to select the desired streams.\n\n- `-map 0:4` selects the video stream with index 4 from the input file.\n- `-map 0:9` selects the audio stream with index 9 from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` specify that the video and audio streams should be copied without re-encoding, which is faster but requires that the codecs are compatible with the output container.\n\nAssuming the selected streams are compatible with the MP4 container, the command would be:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v copy -c:a copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nNote: Make sure to verify the stream indices (0:4 for video and 0:9 for audio) using `ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv` before running the command, as these indices may vary depending on the actual stream layout in your file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the provided guidelines.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's requirements to select specific video and audio streams from an input file and save them as a new MP4 file. The command utilizes the `-map` option properly to select the streams specified by the user and uses the `copy` codec to avoid re-encoding, ensuring both speed and compatibility with the MP4 container format. Thus, there are no errors in the command generation.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output in this case does not resemble the failing example. The command provided by the model does not include any non-existent options or incorrect parameters that would cause it to fail. The codecs (`-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`) are valid and relevant to the task. Therefore, it does not match the failing example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The generated command follows the requirements set forth in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly specifies the input and output files, uses the `-map` option to select the desired streams, and applies the copying method, which is a valid approach when the codecs are compatible with the output format (MP4 in this case). It properly adheres to the syntax and functionality described in the man page, without violating any stipulations.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated is valid, correctly follows user requirements, and adheres to the syntax outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
