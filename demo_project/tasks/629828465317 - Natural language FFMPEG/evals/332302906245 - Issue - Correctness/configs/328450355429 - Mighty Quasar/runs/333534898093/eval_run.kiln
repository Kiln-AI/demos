  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it in two different formats simultaneously, we can use ffmpeg's multiple output feature. This will decode the audio once and encode it to both MP3 (320kbps) and WAV (lossless) formats.\n\n- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input video file (assuming MP4, but works with any video format)\n- `-vn` disables video stream processing since we only want audio\n- `-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k` encodes the first output as MP3 using LAME encoder at 320kbps (highest quality MP3)\n- `-c:a pcm_s16le` encodes the second output as WAV using 16-bit PCM (standard lossless WAV format)\n- `-map 0:a` ensures we're mapping the audio stream from the input to both outputs\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Input file is named `input.mp4` (replace with your actual filename)\n- You want standard 16-bit WAV (most common lossless format)\n- You want the default sample rate preserved from the source\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output command generated by the model does not contain any issues as per the described task. It successfully extracts audio from the video and saves it in both MP3 (with the specified 320kbps bitrate) and WAV (lossless) formats in one command. The command usage adheres to ffmpeg syntax and multi-output functionality. Thus, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated is valid and correctly formatted for the task requested by the user; it does not reference non-existent options or codecs like the example of an incorrect `preset extra_fast` option.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command adheres to the requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. It uses correct options for the desired operations, and the order of the options is appropriate for the inputs and outputs defined. All parameters used (e.g., `-i`, `-vn`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, and general syntax structure) comply with the syntax rules established in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output does not contain the issue described as it met the user's request accurately and generated a functioning ffmpeg command. There are no errors or misconfigurations that would cause the command to fail based on the stated requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
