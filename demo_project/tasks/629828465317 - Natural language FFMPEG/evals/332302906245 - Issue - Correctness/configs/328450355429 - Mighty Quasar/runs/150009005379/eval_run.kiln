  "output": "To transcode `input.mp4` to AVI using the libvpx-vp9 codec with 2-pass encoding, I'll use the `libx264` video codec and `mp3` audio codec. 2-pass encoding generally provides better quality for a given bitrate.\n\n- `libvpx-vp9` is the codec for VP9 video encoding, which is a modern open-source video codec.\n- `libx264` is used for encoding the audio stream to MP3.\n- `-pass 1` and `-pass 2` specify the two passes of encoding.\n- `crf` (Constant Rate Factor) is used to control the video quality. A lower `crf` value results in higher quality, but also a larger file size. A typical range is 18-28.\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pass 1 -crf 23 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k -pass 2 -crf 23 output.avi\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command specifies using `libx264` and `mp3` audio codec instead of the requested `libvpx-vp9` codec for video encoding. This does not match the user's request and suggests an incorrect implementation of the codec choice.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example since it does not contain a completely erroneous command (like a non-existent preset). However, it does misuse encoding options relevant to the task, diverging from the user's specifications.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements dictated in the man page because:\n   - It incorrectly specifies `libx264` for video encoding when the user explicitly requested `libvpx-vp9`. The command should have used `libvpx-vp9` for video encoding instead.\n   - It mentions `mp3` for the audio codec, which is not ideal considering the context. While it may still produce output, the request was missing a specific format for audio output, leading to an assumption that may not meet user expectations.\n\n4) Given the inaccuracies regarding codec usage and unofficial audio specification that does not help fulfill the user's request as expected, the model's output does contain the issue described in the task prompt. Therefore, it should fail."
