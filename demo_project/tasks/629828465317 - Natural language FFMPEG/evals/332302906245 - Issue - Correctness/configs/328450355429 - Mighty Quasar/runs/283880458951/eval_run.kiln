  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "The following ffmpeg command selects video stream 0:4 (indicating 4 times the base resolution of stream 0) and audio stream 0:9 (indicating 9 times the base resolution of stream 0), assuming you are working with a compliant MKV file where such resolution codes make sense (e.g., 1280x720).\n\nThe command also specifies the use of H.264 for video encoding, which is a common codec for MP4 files, and AAC for audio for compatibility with MP4 standards.\n\n- `-i input.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-vcodec libx264` selects H.264 video codec.\n- `-acodec copy` simply copies the audio stream without re-encoding, assuming it's in a format compatible with AAC. This could also be `-c:a aac` if you wish to specifically re-encode the audio to AAC.\n- `-vcodec libx264 -acodec copy` or `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` tells ffmpeg to extract the video and audio from the specified streams and re-encode as needed.\n\nSince you mentioned a simply saving as \"trimmed.mp4\", I've chosen simple copying of audio and re-encoding video for broad compatibility. If you require the original audio codecs, the `copy` option could be necessary, but be aware that there are potential compatibility issues with MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:4:0 -map 0:9:0 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: It is assumed that sound stream 0 (0:0) is the correct audio stream you wish to use, and that the video resolution signified by (0:4) and audio resolution signified by (0:9) are as you intend them to be applied. It is also important to verify that the video stream you want to keep is indeed indexed as stream 0. If the video resolution signifier for stream 0 does not denote the resolution you want, you'll need to specify the correct video stream index and resolution signifier.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step based on the criteria provided.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model misinterpreted the user request regarding the stream selection. The user wants to select video stream `0:4` and audio stream `0:9`, but the command uses `-map 0:4:0` and `-map 0:9:0`. The correct syntax for mapping just the streams should be `-map 0:4` and `-map 0:9` because the syntax `0:4:0` suggests mapping an additional (non-existent) stream. Thus, the command is incorrect and will not execute as expected.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The model's output is not directly similar to the failure example provided. The example fails due to a non-existent preset, while the model's output fails due to incorrect stream mapping. However, both outputs could result in execution failures if the incorrect parameters lead to invalid command structures.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Yes, the command does break requirements dictated by the man page regarding the stream mapping syntax. As mentioned earlier, the mapping should not include an extra `:0` after the stream indices; thus, `-map 0:4:0` and `-map 0:9:0` are incorrect.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model's output contains the issue described as it generates a command that will not work effectively due to the incorrect stream mapping syntax. Therefore, the output does not fulfill the userâ€™s request correctly.\n\n**Conclusion**: The evaluation indicates that the model's output has significant issues due to incorrect command syntax, which aligns with the assessment criteria for a failure in generating effective `ffmpeg` commands."
