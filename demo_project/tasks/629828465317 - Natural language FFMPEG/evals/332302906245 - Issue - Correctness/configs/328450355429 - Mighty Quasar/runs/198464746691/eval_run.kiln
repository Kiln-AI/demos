  "input": "Can you generate an ffmpeg command that uses the rapid preset to quickly convert my input.mp4 to a web-friendly format?",
  "output": "To convert input.mp4 into a web-friendly file as fast as possible, we’ll use the “veryfast” preset (there’s no preset literally named “rapid”; “veryfast” is the closest built-in preset to the user’s request that still yields acceptable quality). We’ll output H.264/AAC in an MP4 container and enable fragmented-MP4 metadata `+faststart` for on-the-fly browser playback.\n\n- preset veryfast trades compression efficiency for speed.  \n- crf 23 gives a decent default quality/file-size balance.  \n- -movflags +faststart re-orders the MP4 metadata so the browser can start playback immediately while the file is still downloading.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command provided is appropriate and should work correctly, aligning with the user's request for a fast conversion to a web-friendly format. The parameters used are standard and expected in such commands.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output does not resemble the failure example since it utilizes valid options and presets as supported by the ffmpeg man page. The command executed does not contain an invalid preset like \"extra_fast\" that was mentioned in the failure example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the expected format for ffmpeg commands, using valid presets and flags. The parameters included are appropriate for converting to a web-friendly MP4 file.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; it effectively generates a valid command that fulfills the user's request. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
