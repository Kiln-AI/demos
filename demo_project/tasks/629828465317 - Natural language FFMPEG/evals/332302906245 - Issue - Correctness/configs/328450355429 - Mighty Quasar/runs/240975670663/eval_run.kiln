  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the second video stream (index 0:1) and the fourth audio track (index 0:3) from input.avi, you need to explicitly specify the streams in the output to avoid copying all other streams. The `-map` option is used to select the desired streams.\n\nKey points:\n- `-map 0:v:1` takes the second video stream from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:3` takes the fourth audio track from the input.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video codec without re-encoding for efficiency.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio codec without re-encoding.\n- MP4 format is used, so compatible codecs like H.264 for video and AAC for audio are assumed.\n\nAssuming the input file has at least two video streams and four audio tracks, this command extracts the correct streams and does not duplicate unnecessary data.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly specifies the extraction of the required video and audio streams using the `-map` option, and uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to copy the codecs. This aligns with the user’s request to extract specific streams without unnecessarily encoding them.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options like `-preset extra_fast`. Instead, it utilizes valid options and syntax specific to the `ffmpeg` command, ensuring that the command will work as intended.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` for stream selection and `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` for codec copying is appropriate and adheres to the described usage for those options.\n\n4) Given the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain any issues and would succeed in performing the requested task based on the user’s input. Therefore, it should pass."
