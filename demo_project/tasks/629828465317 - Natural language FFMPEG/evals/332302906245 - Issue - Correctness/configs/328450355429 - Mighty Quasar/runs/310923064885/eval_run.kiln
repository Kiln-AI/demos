  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM format using the VP9 codec while preserving transparency, you need to encode the video with the VP9 codec and the alpha channel using the VP9 encoder's capability for handling an 8-bit or higher transparency channel. In WebM (specifically VP9), this is achieved by setting the pixel format to `yuva420p` (which includes alpha) and using the `-auto-alt-ref 0` option, which disables some automatic references not compatible with transparency.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-c:v libvpx-vp9` for the VP9 codec.\n- Use `-pix_fmt yuva420p` to include the alpha channel.\n- Use `-auto-alt-ref 0` as ref frames can interfere with alpha.\n- For the audio (if any), either copy or encode as needed (not specified, so I'll copy here).\n\nAssumption: The input movie is well-formatted with a proper alpha channel and you want a lossless or near-lossless output to preserve quality; thus, I'll use a higher `-b:v` bitrate or `-crf` setting.\n\nHere is the optimal command preserving alpha transparency:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -crf 15 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus output.webm\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-crf 15 -b:v 0` specifies a constant quality mode suitable for lossless/lossy but good quality. Adjust value to control quality; <20 is high quality for VP9.\n- `-c:a libopus` encodes audio to Opus (default for WebM).\n- `-auto-alt-ref 0` ensures transparency remains intact because VP9's other reference frames could discard alpha.\n- `-pix_fmt yuva420p` preserves the alpha channel (premultiplied). If the alpha is straight, `yuva420p` is appropriate.\n\nIf you need an even higher quality or lossless (safe for archival), you could use `-b:v 0 -crf 10` or set quality accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures transparency is maintained for web-friendly VP9 WebM playback.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated provides a valid way to convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM format while preserving transparency, meeting the user's requirements for both the codec and format.\n\n2) The output from the model bears no resemblance to the example of a failing output. The command, `ffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -crf 15 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus output.webm`, is valid and does not contain any nonsensical options or parameters. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All options specified are appropriate for the context of the command, and their order follows FFmpeg guidelines. \n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass. Thus, the evaluation concludes that the model performed accurately."
