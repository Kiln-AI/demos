  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from a video file without re-encoding the video stream, use the `-c:v copy` parameter to copy the video stream as-is, and `-an` to disable audio entirely.\n\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding, preserving original quality and making the process very fast\n- `-an` removes all audio streams from the output\n- This operation is very quick since only the video stream is being copied, not processed\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate for the user's request to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream. It correctly utilizes the `-c:v copy` option to copy the video stream unchanged and the `-an` option to remove audio.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output.mp4`) is valid and follows the rationale for what the user requested, unlike the provided failure example, which contains invalid options.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used (`-c:v copy` and `-an`) are both valid options according to the FFmpeg documentation, and the order of options is correctly followed. Additionally, only the audio is being removed while the video is copied as-is, which aligns with the user's requirement.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not contain the issue described. It accurately generates a command that meets the user's requirements, ensuring the audio is removed without affecting the video quality. Therefore, the evaluation would pass."
