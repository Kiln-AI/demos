  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "To apply temporal deinterlacing with search mode set to `1` (horizontal search), scaling the video to 1920x1080, and then sharpening (high pass filter), you can chain these filter sequences in one `-vf` expression. \n\n- `yadif=mode=1` applies advanced deinterlacing search mode 1 for high quality deinterlacing without pixel duplication.\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the video to 1920x1080 (if the input does not have 16:9 aspect ratio, it will be padded).\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0` applies a sharpening filter using the high pass technique with large size and amount.\n\nAssuming your input file is `input.mkv` and you want the output `output.mp4` with these filters applied:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264` selects the H.264 encoder for good compression and compatibility.\n- `-preset slow` speeds up encoding (if preferred, use faster presets like `medium` or `fast`).\n- `-crf 18` controls quality: 18 is visually good; lower for better quality, higher for smaller size.\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio stream without re-encoding for a fast output.\n\nThis command assumes the input is a standard progressive frame sequence (no interlacing). If the input is interlaced with fields, deinterlacing will convert it to progressive.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated correctly implements the userâ€™s request to apply deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening filters. The construction of the command adheres to the requirements and uses valid parameters and options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced does not include any undefined or incorrect options; it correctly specifies parameters for the `-vf` filter and uses valid encoding settings. It does not produce a command that is likely to fail due to incorrect options such as an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options selected and their order are appropriate based on the parameters specified for the input and output files. It maintains correct syntax, applying the `-vf` filter chain followed by specifying video codec, preset, and audio codec. \n\n4) Since the command produced by the model meets the user's request accurately and adheres to FFmpeg syntax without introducing any incorrect options, it does not have the issues described. Thus, the evaluation should pass."
