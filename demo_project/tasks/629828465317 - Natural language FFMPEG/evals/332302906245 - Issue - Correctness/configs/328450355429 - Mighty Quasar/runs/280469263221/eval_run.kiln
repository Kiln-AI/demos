  "input": "I want to convert video.webm to MP4 using the h264 codec with the lightning preset",
  "output": "To convert video.webm to MP4 using the H.264 codec, you can use libx264, which is ffmpeg's highly compatible H.264 encoder. The -preset lightning focuses on very fast encoding at the expense of output quality or file size. For best quality, avoid presets faster than medium (lighter or faster presets usually mean lower compression efficiency). But if lightning is required, hereâ€™s how to use it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset lightning -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- -c:v libx264 chooses H.264 video encoding.\n- -preset lightning drastically speeds up encoding, which lowers compression efficiency (expect larger files or lower quality at the same CRF).\n- -crf 23 sets video quality; lower means better (23 is a good trade-off).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio to AAC at 128kbps for broad compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart moves MP4 metadata to the front so playback starts quickly online.\n\nAssumption: You want compatible audio and output for general usage and streaming. If the source WebM doesn't have audio, just remove audio options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated appears to be syntactically correct and meets the user's requirement of converting a WebM file to MP4 using the H.264 codec. It appropriately uses `libx264`, includes audio options with `aac`, and incorporates the `-movflags +faststart` for better streaming performance.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example given. The command produced does not include any invalid presets, nor does it contain any commands or arguments that would cause it to fail. Specifically, the `-preset lightning` is a valid option that exists and is applicable for `libx264`.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command does not break any requirements set forth in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The usage of the `-i` flag for input, `-c:v` for codec setting, `-preset`, `-crf`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, and `-movflags` are all correctly applied following the guidelines outlined in the man page. Moreover, the order of command-line options is respected, starting with input specification and then summarizing output options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It generated a correct `ffmpeg` command that adheres to the requirements provided by the user and conforms with the information from the man page. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
