  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert `multitrack.mov` to WebM with VP9 while preserving transparency, the key steps are:\n\n1. **Use VP9's alpha support**: VP9 in WebM supports alpha channels via the `yuva420p` pixel format (YUV + alpha plane). FFmpeg must be instructed to retain the alpha channel by setting `-pix_fmt yuva420p`.\n2. **Retain audio tracks**: WebM-compatible audio requires re-encoding (Vorbis or Opus). Here, we use `libopus` for efficient encoding and set a standard bit rate (`-b:a 128k`).\n3. **Preserve original resolution**: Scaling is omitted unless specified; the alpha channel will be preserved as-is if the original resolution is 4:2:0 chroma-subsampled.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input video already uses a compatible alpha channel format (e.g., RGBA or BGRA). If not, FFmpeg may convert it to `yuva420p` automatically.\n- Audio tracks will be re-encoded to Opus for full compatibility. If you want to additionally preserve native alpha/RGBA audio, you may need `-c:a copy`, but this is less common in browsers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -crf 30 -c:a libopus -b:a 128k output.webm\n```\n\n### Explanation of Key Options:\n- **`-c:v libvpx-vp9`**: Enables VP9 encoding via libvpx.\n- **`-pix_fmt yuva420p`**: Specifies a pixel format that includes an alpha channel, crucial for transparency.\n- **`-crf 30`**: A quality/speed CRF value for VP9. Lower values (e.g., 18-23) give higher quality but larger file sizes.\n- **`-c:a libopus`**: Encodes audio to Opus, a modern and WebM-friendly codec.\n- **`-b:a 128k`**: Sets audio bit rate to 128 kbps for balanced quality and file size.\n\nThis command creates a transparent WebM file playable in browsers that support VP9-alpha and Opus. For adaptive streaming, additional segmenting tools or formats (like AVIF WEBP variants) might be needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated appears to be correctly constructed for the task of converting a video with transparency to a WebM format while preserving that transparency using the VP9 codec. All specified options align with the user request for compatibility with an alpha channel and the use of the VP9 codec.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails due to the incorrect preset option. In contrast, the model's generated command utilizes valid options and parameters based on the information provided to it.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command generated by the model adheres to the requirements set forth in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the correct option syntax, applies formats and codecs accordingly, and maintains the order of input and output specifications correctly.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes this evaluation step. It produces a valid FFmpeg command that meets the user's request effectively."
