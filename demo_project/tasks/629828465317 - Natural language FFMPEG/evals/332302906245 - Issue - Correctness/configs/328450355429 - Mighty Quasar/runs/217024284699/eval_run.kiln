  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to chain together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations like rotation and scaling for their shaky footage. Let me think about how to approach this with FFmpeg.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the available filters. For stabilization, there's the 'stabilize' filter. Color grading can be done with 'eq' for equalization or 'hue' for adjusting color. Geometric transformations like rotation and scaling can be handled using 'rotate' and 'scale' filters. But I need to make sure the order is correct because each filter affects the output of the previous one.\n\nWait, the user mentioned rotation and scaling as part of geometric transformation. So the order should be: stabilize first, then apply the geometric transformations, and then color grading. But maybe the color grading should be done after all the transformations? Let me check. Color grading is usually applied after the stabilization and transformations to ensure the color adjustments are based on the final image. So the sequence would be stabilize, rotate, scale, then color grade.\n\nBut how to chain these filters in FFmpeg? The filters are applied in the order they're listed in the filtergraph. So the correct order would be: stabilize, then rotate, then scale, then color grade. Also, each filter might have parameters. For example, the stabilization might need a strength parameter. The rotation could be a specific angle, and scaling could be a percentage. Color grading could involve adjusting brightness, contrast, saturation, etc.\n\nI should also consider the parameters. The 'stabilize' filter might need options like 'strength' or 'method'. For rotation, something like 'rotate=90' or 'rotate=Pi/2'. Scaling could be 'scale=1280:720' or using percentages. Color grading with 'eq' could be 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2: saturation=1.5'.\n\nWait, the user didn't specify exact parameters, so I should use placeholders. Also, need to make sure that the filters are combined properly. For example, using the 'scale' filter after 'rotate' to adjust the size after rotating. Also, the order of rotation and scaling might matter, but the user just wants rotation and scaling as part of the geometric transformation, so perhaps they can be applied in any order, but typically scaling after rotation might be better to avoid distortion.\n\nAnother consideration is the video codec. The user might be using a specific codec, but since they didn't mention, I'll use a common one like libx264 with a preset. The output format would be MP4 as that's standard.\n\nSo putting it all together, the command would include all these filters in order. Let me structure the command step by step:\n\n1. Stabilize the footage.\n2. Rotate the video.\n3. Scale the video to a specific size.\n4. Apply color grading.\n\nAlso, need to check if any of these filters require specific parameters. For example, the 'stabilize' filter might need options like 'strength' or 'method'. Since the user didn't specify, I'll use default parameters and mention that they can adjust them as needed.\n\nAnother thing: the user might need to adjust the order. For example, if they want to rotate first then scale, that's fine. But the main point is to include all three effects in sequence. Also, using the 'filter_complex' option to chain them all together.\n\nSo the final command would look like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"stabilize, rotate=90, scale=1280:720, eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5\" output.mp4\n\nBut wait, the 'rotate' filter might need a specific syntax. Like 'rotate=Pi/2' for 90 degrees. Also, the 'scale' filter might need to use the 'scale' parameter correctly. Also, the 'eq' filter parameters might be different. Let me double-check the correct parameters for each filter.\n\nThe 'stabilize' filter has options like 'method' (default is 'translation'), 'strength' (default 0.01), 'w' and 'h' for window size. The 'rotate' filter uses an angle in radians. The 'scale' filter uses width and height. The 'eq' filter uses parameters like brightness, contrast, saturation.\n\nSo the command would need to include those parameters. But since the user didn't specify, I'll use placeholders, like 'stabilize=method=translation:strength=0.01', 'rotate=Pi/2', 'scale=1280:720', and 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5'.\n\nAlso, the user might need to adjust the order. For example, if they want to apply color grading before scaling, but I think it's better to apply color grading after the transformations. However, the user's question says 'geometric transformation (rotation and scaling)', so maybe they want those as one step, followed by color grading. So the order is correct as stabilize, then geometric transforms, then color grading.\n\nAnother thing: the 'stabilize' filter might require the 'deinterlace' option if the footage is interlaced, but the user didn't mention that. So I'll leave it as default.\n\nSo the final command should include these filters in the correct order, with parameters, and explain each step. Also, mention that parameters can be adjusted based on the specific needs. Also, note that the order might affect the outcome, so the user should test and adjust as needed.\n</think>\n\nTo apply stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations (rotation and scaling) in sequence, use FFmpeg’s filter chain. The order matters: stabilization first, then geometric transformations (rotation/scale), and finally color grading. Parameters are adjusted for common use cases, but you can tweak them as needed.\n\n- `stabilize`: Reduces shakiness (default method: translation; adjust `strength` for intensity).  \n- `rotate`: Rotates the video (e.g., `Pi/2` for 90°).  \n- `scale`: Resizes the video (e.g., `1280:720`).  \n- `eq`: Adjusts color (brightness, contrast, saturation).  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"stabilize=method=translation:strength=0.01, rotate=Pi/2, scale=1280:720, eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Notes**:  \n- Adjust `strength` or `method` (e.g., `method=rotation`) for better stabilization.  \n- Use `rotate=angle` (radians) or `rotate=angle:nb_frames=1` for smooth transitions.  \n- Scaling after rotation ensures dimensions are correct.  \n- Color grading parameters (`eq`) are examples; customize based on your footage.  \n- Ensure the output format supports the desired codec (e.g., `libx264` for MP4).",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step according to your instructions.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - **Evaluation**: The command provided by the model appears to be correctly formatted and includes valid FFmpeg parameters. The chaining of filters is appropriate, and none of the parameters conflict with known FFmpeg usage.\n   - **Result**: **Pass** - The model's output does not contain the issues outlined in the issue description.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - **Evaluation**: The example of a failing output uses a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`). In contrast, the model’s output utilizes valid filters and reasonable parameters, such as `stabilize`, `rotate`, `scale`, and `eq`, ensuring a command that conforms to FFmpeg requirements.\n   - **Result**: **Pass** - The model's output does not match the example of a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - **Evaluation**: The command accurately applies options to the output video file. The filters are chained properly using `-filter_complex`, and each filter's order considers the intended effects on the video. The parameters used are standard, and there doesn't seem to be any issue with the command's syntax that would conflict with the man page documentation.\n   - **Result**: **Pass** - The command does not break any requirements from the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Since the command generated by the model passes all checks against the potential issues with incorrect functionality or syntax, we can conclude that it meets the requirements presented by the user without generating errors or failing conditions.\n   - **Final Result**: **Pass** - The model's output does not contain any of the issues described and works correctly."
