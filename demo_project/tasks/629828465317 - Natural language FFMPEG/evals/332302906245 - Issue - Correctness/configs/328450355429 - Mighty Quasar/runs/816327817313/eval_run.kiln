  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file using the `maximum_compression` preset, you can use the following command.\n\nThis command uses the following techniques/parameters:\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:a flac` tells FFmpeg to encode the audio using the FLAC codec.\n- `-compression_level 12` corresponds to the `maximum_compression` preset for FLAC (ranging from 0 to 12 where 0 is the least compression and 12 is the most).\n- `output.flac` specifies the output file name.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input file contains an audio stream (most video files do).\n- FLAC is the desired output format, and maximum compression is the desired preset.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\nNote: In order to avoid potential quality loss due to transcoding from the original audio codec, make sure your input video's audio stream is copy-compatible with FLAC. If not, additional parameters or even re-encoding from the original audio source may be necessary for optimal results.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here?  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated appears to be syntactically correct and matches the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?  \nThe model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not reference a nonexistent option or preset. Instead, it uses valid options for extracting audio and specifies the compression level correctly.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?  \nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, uses a valid audio codec, and the compression level option for FLAC is appropriately invoked. \n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?  \nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described and can be considered to have successfully generated a valid command. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
