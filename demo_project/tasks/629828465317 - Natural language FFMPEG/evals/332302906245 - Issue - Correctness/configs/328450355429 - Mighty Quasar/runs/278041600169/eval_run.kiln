  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress `video.mp4` using the `maximum_efficiency` preset, which focuses on achieving the best possible compression (smallest file size at the cost of longer encoding time), you should use the H.264 codec for video and AAC for audio. However, please note that `maximum_efficiency` is not a standard preset in `ffmpeg`. Instead, you can use `veryslow` preset for maximum compression and encoding time. \n\nThe `veryslow` preset provides a balanced trade-off between compression efficiency and encoding time, which is suitable for maximum compression without overly increasing the encoding time too much.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset veryslow` sets the encoding speed to very slow, which greatly increases compression efficiency.\n- `-crf 28` (Const-Rate-Factor) sets the quality level. A higher CRF value (up to 51) increases compression efficiency but also decreases quality. `28` is a good balance for saving storage space.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` sets the audio codec to AAC with a bitrate of 128 kbps.\n- `output.mp4` is the name of the output file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the output does contain the issue described. The model suggested using the `\"maximum_efficiency\"` preset, which is not a standard preset recognized in `ffmpeg`. Instead, it should have provided a valid preset like `\"veryslow\"` that serves the purpose of achieving high compression efficiency.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, it is similar to the failing output example. The output indicates using an invalid preset that does not exist within `ffmpeg`, much like the example of using `\"extra_fast\"` which also does not exist.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the model's output effectively breaks a requirement in the man page by proposing the use of a preset that does not exist. Preset names like `\"maximum_efficiency\"` do not have a corresponding implementation within `ffmpeg`, making the command invalid.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output fails because it includes an invalid preset, thus it does contain the issue described. The command generated by the model would not work correctly and does not meet the user's requirements for compression."
