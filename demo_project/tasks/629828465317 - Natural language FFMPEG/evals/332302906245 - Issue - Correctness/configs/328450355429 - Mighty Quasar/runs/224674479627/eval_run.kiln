  "input": "I need to compress a video to 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming.",
  "output": "To compress a video to approximately 500 Mbps using H.264 encoding for streaming, you want to maximize the bitrate, choose the appropriate preset for encoding speed vs. quality, and create an MP4 container (native to web). H.264 (libx264) is generally the best choice for web streaming due to its efficient compression and broad browser compatibility.\n\nKey points:\n- `-b:v 500M` or `-b:v 500m` specifies the video bitrate in Mbps (you can drop the „M“ for megabits, e.g., `-b:v 500m`). This sets the target bitrate, which controls the quality/compression tradeoff.\n- `-c:v libx264` ensures encoding with the H.264 codec.\n- `-preset slow` balances encoding speed and compression efficiency. Other presets like \"veryfast\", \"medium\", and \"slower\" exist; speed affects encoding time rather than final quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures better compatibility and compressed size (can be omitted, but recommended).\n- Remove `-movflags +faststart` if you don't need it for streaming, since it places the metadata at the end.\n- Audio is encoded to AAC (256 kbps) for web compatibility: `-c:a aac -b:a 256k`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 500m -c:v libx264 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 256k output_streaming.mp4\n```\nThis will produce a streamable, compressed 500 Mbps video MP4 suitable for web streaming. Adjust `-preset` or audio bitrate as desired.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for the user's request of compressing a video to a specific bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not use a non-existent preset; instead, it uses the preset \"slow,\" which is a valid preset for the H.264 codec.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It properly specifies the input file, uses valid options for setting the bitrate, codec, preset, pixel format, and audio encoding. All options are correctly applied to the output file.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations from the previous steps, the model's output does not contain the issues described and adheres to the requirements from the man page. Therefore, it should be marked as a pass."
