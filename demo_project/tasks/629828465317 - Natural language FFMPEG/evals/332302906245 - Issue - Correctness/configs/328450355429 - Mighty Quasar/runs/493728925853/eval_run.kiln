  "output": "To transform input.mp4 to MKV using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset, you can use thefollowing command:\n\n- `-c:v libx265` selects the x265 encoder.\n- `-preset veryslow` optimizes for highest quality (longer encoding time).\n- `-crf 23` sets the quality level (lower is better; 23 is default balanced CRF).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-movflags faststart` is skipped since output format is MKV, which doesn't use this flag.\n\nThis command encodes the video with x265 and keeps the original audio untouched.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and adheres to the user's request to transform `input.mp4` to `output.mkv` using the `libx265` encoder with the `veryslow` preset while copying the audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid, and all parameters used are correct. The preset `veryslow` exists and is applicable to the `libx265` encoder, which means the command wouldn't fail in the same manner as the `extra_fast` preset in the example.\n\n3) After reviewing the man page for `ffmpeg`, the generated command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command is structured properly, and all options used are valid for the task at hand. \n\nIn summary, the model's output is valid, correctly matches the requirements from the user, and does not contain any issues related to command syntax or parameter validity. Therefore, it should pass evaluation."
