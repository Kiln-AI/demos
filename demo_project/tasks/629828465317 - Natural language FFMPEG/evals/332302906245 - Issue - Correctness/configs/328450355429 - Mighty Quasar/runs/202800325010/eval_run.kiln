  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in a single command, you can use the `-c:a` option to specify the audio codec for each output file. \n\n- `c:a libmp3lame` is used for MP3 encoding.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the bitrate for MP3 to 320 kbps.\n- For the WAV file, you don't need to specify a codec since WAV is an uncompressed format, but `-c:a pcm_s16le` can be used to ensure 16-bit little-endian PCM encoding, which is a common format for WAV.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output_mp3.mp3 -c:a pcm_s16le output_wav.wav\n```\n\nAssumptions: \n- The input file is `input_video.mp4`. Replace this with the actual name of your input file.\n- The audio in the input file is in a format that can be processed by `ffmpeg` without additional parameters. If the input file has multiple audio streams, `ffmpeg` will automatically select the first one. If you need to select a specific audio stream, you would use the `-map` option.\n\nNote: Since you're asking for both MP3 and WAV outputs, `ffmpeg` will automatically create two separate files according to the specified output names (`output_mp3.mp3` and `output_wav.wav`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the `<issue_description>`. The generated command correctly extracts audio from the input video and saves it as both an MP3 with a specified bitrate and a lossless WAV file. It adheres to the requirements set by the user for the task.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output `<failure_example>`. The command is syntactically correct and specifies valid codec options. The model correctly uses `-c:a libmp3lame` for MP3 and `-c:a pcm_s16le` for WAV, which are valid parameters.\n\n3) According to the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements. The output demonstrates an appropriate understanding of ffmpeg's options, notably using the audio codec selection appropriately. The explanation indicates an understanding of codec syntax for both audio formats involved.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output performs accurately with no issues. It correctly constructs an ffmpeg command that meets the requirements of the user input, making no violations concerning the man page specifications. The command produced should work correctly to extract audio in the requested formats. \n\nFinal Evaluation: Pass."
