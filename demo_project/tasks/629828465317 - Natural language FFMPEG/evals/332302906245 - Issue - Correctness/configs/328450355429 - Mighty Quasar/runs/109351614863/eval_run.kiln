  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction, we use a combination of the `transpose` filter for rotation and the `nlmeans` (non-local means) filter for denoising. Here's how it works:\n\n- **`transpose=1`**: Rotates the video 90° clockwise (swap width/height and vertical flip). This is part of the video filter chain (`-vf`).\n- **`nlmeans=s=20:h=24:t=4`**:\n  - `s=20`: Aggressive noise reduction strength (sigma value for spatial noise).\n  - `h=24`: Expands spatial search range for denoising, enhancing detail preservation.\n  - `t=4`: Temporal search distance to reduce noise between frames.\n  - These values are tuned for strong noise reduction but may produce visible artifacts if overused.\n- **`libx264` and `aac`**: Standard H.264 and AAC codecs for compatibility and quality.\n- **`yuv420p`**: Ensures widely compatible pixel format for most players and platforms.\n- **`-preset slow`**: Balances encoding time and compression efficiency for denoised output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,nlmeans=s=20:h=24:t=4\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n### Assumptions\n- Input uses H.264 or compatible video codec.\n- Audio is re-encoded with AAC at 128 kbps for compatibility.\n- Output resolution automatically adjusts to match the rotated dimensions (width and height swapped).\n- `nlmeans` is used for advanced noise reduction; adjust `s/h/t` values if needed to avoid over-sharpening/over-smoothing.\n- CRF 23 (Constant Rate Factor) preserves quality after rotation/denoising. Lower values (-17 or -20) may be better for high-quality results.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Based on the evaluation criteria provided, let's analyze the model's output step by step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not seem to contain a functional issue. The command it produced appears to be logically structured according to the `ffmpeg` syntax and uses valid filters (`transpose` and `nlmeans`) along with appropriate codec options. So, it does not contain the issue of generating a command that fails to meet the requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing example. The command generated is valid and coherent regarding how `ffmpeg` commands are structured. Unlike the example where it uses an invalid preset (`extra_fast`), the model’s command comprises appropriate filters and options.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the general guidelines outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. The sequence of input and output settings, along with the filters specified, are correctly positioned. Each parameter is valid for the context provided (input/video filters/codec settings). Additionally, the logical chaining of the filters in the `-vf` parameter is acceptable as per standard usage.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe analysis indicates that the model's output does not present any issues based on the descriptions or examples provided. Therefore, it should pass.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is accurate and correctly follows `ffmpeg` requirements without introducing any mistakes in its command generation. Thus, it is functioning as expected for the given task."
