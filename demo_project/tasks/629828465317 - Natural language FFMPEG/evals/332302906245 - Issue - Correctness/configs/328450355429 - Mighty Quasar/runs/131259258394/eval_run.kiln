  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract a specific video stream (0:4) and audio stream (0:9) from broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4, you use the -map option to select the desired streams. This command copies the streams directly (-c copy), which is fast and lossless, but ensures compatibility by re-muxing into MP4. Note that if the selected streams are encoded with formats not supported by MP4 (e.g., video: some forms of HEVC or audio: FLAC), you may need to re-encode; this command assumes they are compatible (e.g., H.264 video, AAC or AC3 audio).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\n- -map 0:4 picks video stream 4 from input (0 is the input file number; 4 is the stream index).\n- -map 0:9 picks audio stream 9.\n- -c copy avoids re-encoding, keeping original quality and making the operation much faster.\n\nIf you encounter errors about unsupported codecs in MP4, let me know, and I can provide a command to re-encode as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain** the issue described. The command generated by the model accurately uses the `-map` option to select the specific video and audio streams mentioned by the user and employs the `-c copy` flag, indicating a direct copy without re-encoding, which is appropriate given the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4`) is correctly formulated and does not use any invalid parameters, unlike the failing example which used an incorrect preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly follows the syntax rules for specifying input files, using options, and mapping streams. The use of `-map` to select streams and `-c copy` for direct copying adheres to the documented practices for ffmpeg.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output does **not contain the issue described** and should **pass** evaluation as it provides a valid and functional ffmpeg command that meets the user's request."
