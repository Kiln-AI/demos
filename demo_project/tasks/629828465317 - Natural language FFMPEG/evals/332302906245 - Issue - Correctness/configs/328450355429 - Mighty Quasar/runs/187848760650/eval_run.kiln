  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo stabilize and enhance shaky video footage, you can chain together the following filters:\n\n1. **Stabilization** with `vidstabtransform` (requires initial `vidstabdetect` pass).\n2. **Color grading** with `eq` (equalize brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma, etc.).\n3. **Geometric transformations** (rotate and scale) using the `rotate` and `scale` filters.\n\n**Process Overview:**\n- First, run a stabilization analysis with `vidstabdetect`.\n- Then, apply the stabilization transform, color grading, and rotation/scale in a single command.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- Input video is `input.mov`.\n- Output is `output.mp4`.\n- You may need a black border due to stabilization, so scale to orig dimensions if needed.\n- Color grading values are placeholder; please adjust as desired.\n\n### Sample workflow\n\n**1. Stabilization analysis:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result=transforms.trf -f null -\n```\n\n**2. Applying stabilization, color grading, and rotation/scale:**\n\nAssuming you want to apply a 45-degree rotation, scale 1.5x, and do some color grading (contrast +0.2, brightness +0.1, etc.).\nReplace `ROTATION_ANGLE`, `SCALE_FACTOR`, and color grading values as needed.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -vf \"vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf:zoom=1:smoothing=30,eq=contrast=1.2:brightness=0.1:saturation=1.2,rotate=ROTATION_ANGLE*cpi(t)/cpi(t)*PI/180:scale=iw*1.5*0.8:ih*1.5*0.8:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,pad=width=iw*1.5:height=ih*1.5:x=(iw*1.5-iw)/2:y=(ih*1.5-ih)/2,setsar=1\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of filters:**\n\n- `vidstabtransform` applies stabilization after the `transforms.trf` analysis.\n- `zoom=1` and `smoothing=30` control the margin of the frame and smoothing.\n- `eq` adds color grading: brightness, contrast, and saturation.\n- `rotate=ROTATION_ANGLE*...` rotates the video. Replace `ROTATION_ANGLE` with your desired angle (e.g., 45). The expression ensures rotation is applied smoothly over time.\n- `scale=...` scales the video; multiplying by 1.5 and then padding to center with the original aspect ratio.\n- `setsar` sets the sample aspect ratio for correct display.\n\nFeel free to adjust parameters for your specific needs (smoothing, color grading values, rotation angle, etc.).\n\nLet me know if you want to apply a specific set of values or have multiple transformations!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains an issue as it does not produce a complete `ffmpeg` command suitable for executing the intended task, specifically stabilizing a video, color grading, and applying geometric transformations in a single step. The output provides steps rather than a single executable command. While it gives a sample command for stabilization (analysis phase) and an example command for the desired transformations, it still lacks clarity in explicitly defining the expected end command that chains these operations seamlessly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does provide command structures that would work separately for stabilization and transformations, but it does not fully detail the proper parameters and structure for chaining them into one command, which is crucial. The concern here is not about incorrect options or parameters but rather the omission of a complete command that can be executed directly.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nSince the output lacks one cohesive command and instead provides multiple separate commands without fully detailing how they integrate under the same execution, it does not outright disobey any singular syntax rule from the man page. However, it does not meet the requirements of forming a complete command for the user as stipulated in the task instructions, which further illustrates its inadequacy.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. It fails to provide a clear and complete `ffmpeg` command that the user can directly execute, marking it as ineffective for the user's request."
