  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the first video stream and the third audio stream from movie.mkv and save them into final.mp4, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg. Here, -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream from the input, and -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream (indexing starts at 0).\n\nAssumptions:\n- The first image stream is 0:v:0\n- The third audio stream is 0:a:2\n- The output format is MP4, so codecs should be compatible (libx264 for video, aac for audio).\n- Streams will be re-encoded for compatibility.\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v libx264 sets H.264 as the video codec for MP4 compatibility.\n- -c:a aac sets AAC as the audio codec.\n- -map explicitly selects the streams.\n\nHere's the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart final.mp4\n```\n\n- This extracts the first video and third audio streams, encodes video as H.264 and audio as AAC, and prepares the MP4 for fast streaming. Adjust -crf/preset for different quality/speed tradeoffs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly extracts the specified streams from the input file `movie.mkv`, following the user's requirements by using the `-map` options appropriately to select the first video stream and the third audio stream.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated uses valid syntax and parameters, while the failure example provided contains an invalid preset option (`extra_fast`) that does not exist in `ffmpeg`. There is no such problem in the model's output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly defines the input file, maps the streams that need to be extracted, and specifies codecs that are compatible with the MP4 format. The use of options is in the correct order according to the man page's guidelines.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described and thus should pass the evaluation."
