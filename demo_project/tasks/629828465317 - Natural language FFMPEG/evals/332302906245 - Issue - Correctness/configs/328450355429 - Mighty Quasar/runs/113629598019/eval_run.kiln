  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as high-resolution PNG images, use the fps video filter which sets the desired frame rate (1 frame/2 seconds = 0.5 fps). PNG is a lossless format, so each image will be highest possible quality. By default, ffmpeg will use the source resolution; if your source is already high-res, this will preserve it.\n\nParameters explained:\n- -vf fps=0.5 tells ffmpeg to output 1 frame every 2 seconds.\n- output_%04d.png specifies that output images will be named sequentially (number with 4 digits, starting from 0000).\n- ffmpeg will keep the original resolution.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 output_%04d.png\n```\n\nAssumption: video.avi is your source file and you want to preserve its original resolution. With this setup, you will get PNG images with the same resolution as the source video, extracted every 2 seconds.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 output_%04d.png`) correctly fulfills the user's requirement of extracting frames every 2 seconds and saving them as PNG images. The output adequately explains the parameters used and makes a clear assumption about preserving the original resolution.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated is valid and uses correct parameters to achieve the specified task, and there are no mistakes in the command that would lead to failure.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses the correct syntax and options for extracting frames at a specified rate (every 2 seconds), and specifies the output format correctly. All parameters used are valid according to the provided documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described; it successfully generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
