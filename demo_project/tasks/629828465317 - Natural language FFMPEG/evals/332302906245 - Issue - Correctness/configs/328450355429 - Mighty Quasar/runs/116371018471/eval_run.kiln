  "input": "I need to compress a video to 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming.",
  "output": "To compress your video to a target bitrate of 500 Mbps using H.264 encoding for optimal streaming quality, specify the video bitrate with -b:v 500M. Setting -maxrate and -bufsize helps ensure consistent quality and proper streaming behavior. Use -preset veryfast (or faster if you need quicker encoding) for efficient compression. For compatibility and streaming, apply yuv420p pixel format and use AAC audio encoding.\n\nKey parameters:\n\n- -b:v 500M sets target video bitrate.\n- -maxrate 500M and -bufsize 1000M control bitrate variability for streaming.\n- -c:v libx264 video codec with -preset veryfast balances speed and quality.\n- -c:a aac and -b:a 128k for audio standard streaming quality.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart enables fast streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -b:v 500M -maxrate 500M -bufsize 1000M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions: Your source is input.mp4 and output is output.mp4; audio bitrate of 128k is standard for streaming; target bitrate is exact as requested. Adjust as needed for your scenario.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirement to compress the video to a specified bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming. Upon inspection, all parameters utilized in the command are appropriate for the task outlined by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command is well-structured and includes existing codecs, options, and parameters. It utilizes valid options and does not include any erroneous preset names such as `extra_fast`.\n\n3) Referring to the `ffmpeg` man page, the command does **not** break any requirements dictated therein. All the options used, such as `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`, are specified correctly and follow the syntax rules of the `ffmpeg` command-line tool. \n\n4) Overall, the model's output does NOT contain the issue described and should be marked as successful. The command provided correctly meets the user's request without any errors or deviations from the specifications set in the man page."
