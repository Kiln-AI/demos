  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from a multi-track file, you can use the -map option with ffmpeg. -map 0:v:5 picks the sixth video stream (counting starts at 0), and -map 0:a:8 selects the ninth audio stream. The output codecs are set to H.264 (libx264) for video and AAC for audio, ensuring compatibility with most MP4 players. -movflags +faststart helps with web streaming.\n\nAssumption: Your input file has at least 9 audio streams and 6 video streams, and you want the standard yuv420p pixel format for broad compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:5 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p -map 0:a:8 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- This command produces an MP4 containing only the specified video and audio tracks. Adjust file names and stream index/codec parameters as needed for your specific file.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here?\nThe model's output correctly generates a command that matches the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from a multi-track file. The syntax and options used are appropriate and valid according to FFmpeg's documentation. Therefore, it does not contain the issue mentioned in the description.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?\nThe model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does not have any incorrect options or invalid presets. The command correctly uses options like `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`, making it a well-formed command.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command does not break any requirements documented in the man page for FFmpeg. The mapping of streams with `-map`, the specification of codecs with `-c:v` and `-c:a`, and the inclusion of additional parameters (like `-crf 23`, `-preset fast`, `-pix_fmt yuv420p`, and `-movflags +faststart`) are all correctly applied according to the syntax outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, as it successfully generates a command that is suitable for the user's request without any mistakes in the syntax or parameters. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
