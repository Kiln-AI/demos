  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file, you use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. Here, you want to select video stream 15 and audio stream 22 from `source.mkv`.\n\n- `-map 0:15` selects the 16th stream (0-based index) from the first input (which is `source.mkv`).\n- `-map 0:22` selects the 23rd stream for audio.\n- To avoid copying unnecessary streams, we only map the selected streams.\n- The codec options `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` will directly copy the streams without re-encoding (lossless, fast).\n\nAssuming you want an MKV output that preserves the codecs and container compatibility:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c:v copy -c:a copy selected_streams.mkv\n```\n\nIf you want to re-encode streams or change container formats, please specify.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model accurately selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file `source.mkv`. The use of `-map` is appropriate, and the command effectively preserves the streams by using `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`, which is correct.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and correctly structured, whereas the failing example provides a command that uses a non-existent preset (`-preset extra_fast`), which would fail due to incorrect syntax and options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the correct usage for selecting input streams and copying codecs without any alterations that could conflict with the FFmpeg command structure.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass. The command is valid, appropriate, and works as intended without any errors."
