  "input": "Please convert my screen recording to MP4 using the blazing preset for quick upload",
  "output": "To optimize for fast encoding and quick upload, we’ll convert your screen recording to MP4 using the H.264 codec with the veryfast preset. This produces a good balance between speed and file size/quality. The output is browser-friendly (yuv420p pixel format).\n\n- -c:v libx264: Uses H.264 codec for compatibility.\n- -preset veryfast: Maximizes encoding speed (good for quick uploads, less compression efficiency).\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures maximum compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart: Places metadata at the start for instant playback during upload/streaming.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: Encodes audio in AAC (widely supported).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_screen_recording.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your original recording is input_screen_recording.mkv (change extension as needed).\n- You want both video and audio to be compatible for web/browser use.\n- The “blazing preset” for upload corresponds to H.264 veryfast preset for speed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command is syntactically correct and aligns well with the user's request to convert the screen recording to an MP4 file utilizing the \"blazing preset\" for quick uploads, which it interprets correctly in terms of encoding speed.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced (using `-preset veryfast`) is valid and uses a recognized encoding preset. The failure example depicts the use of a non-existent preset, which is not the case here.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used in the command are valid and appropriately ordered according to the description provided in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should be considered to **pass**."
