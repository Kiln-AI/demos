  "input": "Convert my MOV file to WebM format using the libx264 codec for online video",
  "output": "To convert your `.mov` file to WebM using a codec compatible with that container, use **libvpx** (for VP8/VP9 video) instead of libx264 (which is for H.264, used in MP4). WebM requires the WebM/Matroska container with VP9 video and Opus/Vorbis audio for optimal compatibility with online players like YouTube or HTML5 browsers. The example below uses **libvpx** with **VP9** for high compression efficiency and **Opus** for modern audio encoding.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx` selects the VP8/VP9 video encoder.\n- `-crf 30` balances quality and file size (lower values yield better quality; 30 is a good starting point for online use).\n- `-b:v 1M` sets a target video bitrate (adjust as needed for your target quality or size).\n- `-c:a opus -b:a 128k` encodes audio in Opus at a reasonable bitrate for web playback.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with all browsers by avoiding chroma subsampling issues.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libvpx -crf 30 -b:v 1M -c:a opus -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.webm\n```\n\n**Assumption**: The input audio is in a supported format (e.g., stereo PCM, AAC). If it's not, additional audio filters or conversion might be necessary. Use `-c:a vorbis` instead of Opus if streaming via older services that donâ€™t support Opus.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. It incorrectly suggests using the `libx264` codec for a WebM file, while WebM files typically utilize `libvpx` (for VP8/VP9) as the video codec, not `libx264` which is specific to the MP4 container format. This mistake indicates a failure to prioritize correct codec usage based on the target format specified by the user. \n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example because it suggests a configuration that does not align with the expectations of the command's requirements. Using `libx264` for a WebM file is inappropriate and will cause the command to fail, similar to using a nonexistent preset in the provided example.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page because it attempts to use `libx264` for a WebM container, which is not compatible. WebM requires codecs like `libvpx` or `libvpx-vp9`, hence it does not conform with the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page regarding compatible codecs for specific output formats.\n\nOverall, the model's output is flawed because it suggests using an incompatible codec, resulting in a command that would not work correctly for the user's request. Therefore, it should be marked as a fail."
