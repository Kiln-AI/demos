  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "To achieve high quality output with extremely high bitrates, you'll need to use FFmpeg's support for the High Dynamic Range (HDR) and its ability to handle high bitrates. You can achieve this with:\n\n- `-c:v libx265`: Specifies the codec (H.265) for the video path.\n- `-c:a aac`: Specifies the codec (AAC) for the audio path.\n- `-b:v 100g`: Specifies the bitrate for the video (100 gigabits per second).\n- `-(crftune 48 | -stats format vlog)`: Adjusts the bitrate optimization calculations to lower the bitrate at the cost of quality (increasing bitrate).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:a aac -b:a 500k -c:v libx265 -b:v 100g -crftune 48 -stats format vlog output.mp4\n```\n\nNote that this will not result in an output file that can be streamed efficiently and is very restrictive as \"input.avi\" was not specified as a device. That makes FFmpeg choose to try to maximize bitrates for potentially enormous losses of quality in the final product. It can also lead to running the command for quite some time. Even H.265 supports up to 128 kbps for each audio channel, though.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The specified video bitrate of 100 Gbps is unfeasible for most typical setups and is likely to result in an error or excessive resource usage during processing. The command also uses the option `-(crftune 48 | -stats format vlog)`, which is improperly formatted and unclear, as it should not contain alternatives or improper syntax. Furthermore, the command does not specify an input file correctly, which could lead to confusion and incorrect application of parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example because it includes a command (`-crftune 48 | -stats format vlog`) that has invalid syntax. Additionally, it does not follow the expected structure of ordered options correctly, leading to potential misunderstanding by the FFmpeg tool.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. Specifically, the use of `-(crftune 48 | -stats format vlog)` is invalid, and high bitrates like `100g` for video encoding would not be practically supported and could lead to an inability to execute the command properly.\n\nOverall, the model's output does contain issues related to incorrect command generation and likely failure to conform to FFmpeg syntax and operational parameters. Therefore, it fails the evaluation based on the user's request and the man page."
