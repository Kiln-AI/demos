  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, let me figure out how to extract frames every 2 seconds as PNGs with ultra high resolution.\n\nFirst, the user wants frames at 2-second intervals. The -vf select command with the 'gte' function can do that. So I'll use select='not(mod(t,2))' to choose a frame every 2 seconds. But wait, the select filter uses timestamps in seconds, so mod(t,2) gives 0 at 2,4,6, etc. Using 'not(mod(t\\,2))' selects frames at those times.\n\nNext, image output as PNG. The -vcodec png sets the codec. For ultra high resolution, I should not scale the video. But the original video's resolution is used by default. So if the user's video is high res, the PNGs will be too. But if they want to upscale, maybe they need a scale filter. However, the problem says \"ultra high resolution,\" which is a bit ambiguous. Maybe just using the original resolution, assuming the input has high enough resolution, is best. Adding a scale filter might be needed, but the user didn't specify, so I should stick to the original. Alternatively, they might want to upscale, but without a specific size, it's risky. So I'll proceed with the original resolution.\n\nAlso, frame numbers in filenames. The output pattern is image-%04d.png. So -r 0.5 vs fps? Wait, if frames are every 2 seconds, and if the video is 30 fps, then 2 seconds is 60 frames. But the user wants one frame per 2 seconds, so using -frames:v 1 every 2 seconds. But the select filter is the right approach.\n\nSo the command should be:\n\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"select='not(mod(t,2))'\" -vcodec png -vsync 0 image-%04d.png\n\nWait, -vsync 0 is important to prevent frame rate conversion artifacts. Because select might produce variable frame rates. Using -vsync vfr, but -vsync 0 is the same. Also, using image-%03d.png or similar for numbering. The output example uses 04d, so I'll go with that.\n\nWait, the user said \"ultra high resolution\" but if the input is already high res, that's fine. If not, the user might need to scale. But since there's no parameter given, perhaps the answer is to extract at original resolution. However, maybe the user wants the full resolution. So perhaps no scale filter is needed. So the answer is selecting every 2 seconds, saving asPNG at original resolution.\n\nBut the user might want higher than input resolution. But without scaling parameters, it's impossible. So the answer should be as I outlined. Then, the explanation would include the select filter, the codec, the filename pattern, and mention that the resolution is as the original. Also, if the user wants to scale, they can add a scale filter. But since the user didn't specify, the answer is without scaling.\n</think>\n\nTo extract frames every 2 seconds at the original video resolution (assumed to be \"ultra high\" as requested), use the `select` filter to select frames at 0s, 2s, 4s, etc. Save them as PNGs with maximum quality (lossless) and high compression. \n\n- `select='not(mod(t,2))'` picks one frame every 2 seconds (uses timestamp in seconds).\n- No scaling is applied, so output resolution matches the input video's original resolution (assumed to be \"ultra high\").\n- `-vcodec png` ensures lossless PNG encoding.\n- `-vsync 0` prevents ffmpeg from duplicating/removing frames, ensuring only selected frames are saved.\n- Output filenames use numbered `image-%04d.png` for clarity.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"select='not(mod(t,2))'\" -vsync 0 -vcodec png image-%04d.png\n```\n\nIf your input video is not already ultra high resolution, add a `scale` filter (e.g., `-vf \"scale=WxH:flags=lanczos\"`) to upscale before PNG extraction. For example, to 4k resolution:  \n```bash\n-vf \"scale=3840x2160:flags=lanczos,select='not(mod(t,2))'\"\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is correct and follows the requirements specified by the user, which is to extract frames every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images at the original resolution.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is valid and does not use any non-existing options or incorrect syntax that would cause the command to fail.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used in the command align with the expected usage, such as using `-vf` for video filters and `-vcodec` for specifying the codec. The syntax follows the correct order established in the man page, and all options are valid.\n\nOverall, the model successfully generated a correct command that meets the userâ€™s request and adheres to the FFmpeg command structure as outlined in the man page. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described."
