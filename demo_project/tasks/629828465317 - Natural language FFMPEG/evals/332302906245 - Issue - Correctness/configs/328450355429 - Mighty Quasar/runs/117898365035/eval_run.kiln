  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds, we use the `-vf fps=1/2` filter, which takes one frame every 2 seconds. For ultra-high resolution output, we assume you want to keep the original video resolution (or scale up if needed). Since no scaling was specified, I'll extract at the original resolution. The output format will be PNG images named sequentially.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 output_%04d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video.avi`: Input file.\n- `-vf fps=1/2`: Extract one frame every 2 seconds.\n- `output_%04d.png`: Output filename pattern with zero-padded frame numbers for ordering. PNG format preserves high quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated seems to be correct and should work to extract frames as requested by the user. It properly specifies the input file and uses the `-vf fps=1/2` filter to extract one frame every 2 seconds, which meets the user's requirement for extracting frames.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any invalid options or unavailable presets like `extra_fast`. It adheres to the usage of options and should execute without issues.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used (`-i`, `-vf`, and the output pattern) are valid according to the documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It generates a valid command that meets the user's requirements accurately. The evaluation checks show that the command is structured correctly and follows FFmpeg syntax, making it a successful output for the given task."
