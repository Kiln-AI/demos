    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file without errors. The command matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output in the <failure_example>. The generated command is syntactically correct, using valid options and parameters appropriate for the task of mapping specific streams.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-map` options is correctly implemented, and the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options are correctly used for copying the video and audio streams without re-encoding. According to the man page, it properly adheres to the order of options and file specifications.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and thus should be considered a successful and correct response to the user's input."
