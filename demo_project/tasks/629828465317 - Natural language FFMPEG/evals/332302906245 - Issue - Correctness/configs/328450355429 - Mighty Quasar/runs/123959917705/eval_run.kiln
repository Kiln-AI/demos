  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply brightness, contrast, and scale filters, you can chain them together using the `-vf` option in `ffmpeg`. The order in which the filters are specified is the order in which they are applied. I assume you want to preserve the aspect ratio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"brightness=0.10,contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file. Change `input.mp4` to your actual input file.\n*   `-vf \"brightness=0.10,contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\"`: Applies the video filters.\n    *   `brightness=0.10`: Increases the brightness of the video. Adjust the value (e.g., 0.10) as needed. Negative values decrease brightness.\n    *   `contrast=1.2`: Increases the contrast of the video. Adjust the value (e.g., 1.2) as needed. Values less than 1 decrease contrast.\n    *   `scale=-2:1080`: Scales the video to 1080p height, maintaining aspect ratio. The `-2` tells ffmpeg to select an appropriate width to preserve the aspect ratio and ensure that the width is divisible by 2, a common requirement for video codecs.\n*   `output.mp4`: Specifies the output video file. You can change the extension and container format, such as to `.mkv`, and the video and audio codecs will be selected automatically. If you want more control, specify them explicitly with `-c:v` and `-c:a`, e.g. `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated should work correctly and matches the user's requirements by applying the brightness and contrast filters, as well as resizing the video to 1080p.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is correct and does not use any invalid or non-existent options (such as the \"extra_fast\" preset mentioned in the failing output).\n\n3) Referring to the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements outlined. All options specified (brightness, contrast, scale) are both valid and correctly formatted. The use of chaining filters with the `-vf` option is appropriate.\n\n4) Given the evaluation of the command and the analysis of the man page, it can be concluded that the model's output does not contain any issues. The ffmpeg command is valid and fulfills the user's request reliably, so it passes the evaluation."
