  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 8 audio streams. I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. This allows you to choose specific streams by their indices.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_file_index:stream_index` where the input file index is typically 0 for the first (and often only) input file, followed by the stream index within that file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding the streams, which will be faster and maintain original quality. The command maps video stream index 3 (the third video stream) and audio stream index 8 (the eighth audio stream) from the input file to create the output MP4.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command it generated uses the wrong stream indices for mapping. The user specified they wanted to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7, but the model generated a command that maps video stream 0:3 (the fourth video stream) and audio stream 0:8 (the ninth audio stream) instead. This means the command will not meet the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is different from the failure example given, which is an example of generating a completely invalid command. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and follows the general structure of the `ffmpeg` command, but it fails to comply with the user's specified requirements due to the incorrect stream indices.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirement dictated by the user input, as the stream mapping does not match the indices specified by the user. The man page for `ffmpeg` indicates that the `-map` option should reference the correct index numbers to select the desired streams from the input file.\n\n4) The model's output contains the issue described. It fails because the generated command does not accurately reflect the user's request for specific stream mappings."
