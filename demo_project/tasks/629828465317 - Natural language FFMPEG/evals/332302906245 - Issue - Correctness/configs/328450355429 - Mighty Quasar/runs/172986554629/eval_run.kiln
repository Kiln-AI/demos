  "output": "To extract frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and save them as ultra high-resolution PNG images, use the `fps` filter to set the frame rate to 1/2 Hz (1 frame every 2 seconds) and specify the output as PNG.\n\n- `-vf fps=0.5` sets the frame rate to 0.5 frames per second, which is equivalent to extracting one frame every 2 seconds.\n- `-s` is not needed as the output resolution will default to the input resolution.\n- `-vcodec png` selects the PNG encoder, which supports ultra high-resolution and lossless compression.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input video resolution is sufficient for ultra high-resolution framing.\n- PNG output will be dumped to the directory from which `ffmpeg` is run. Filenames will be prefixed with `output_` followed by a zero-padded number.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -vcodec png output_%03d.png\n```\nNote: This command will produce PNG files named `output_001.png`, `output_002.png`, etc. If you want to prefix the filename with a timestamp (HHMMSS) instead, you can use the `frame_pts` function in the filename, like so:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -vcodec png output_%04d.png\n```\nHowever, if you want the actual timestamp, you would need a more complex filename, which involves shell scripting or advanced batch renaming.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues related to the command generation as stated in the issue description. The command it produced correctly implements the user's request to extract frames every 2 seconds from the video.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -vcodec png output_%03d.png`) is syntactically correct and uses valid options for the task required, while the failing example includes a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly specifies input and output files and applies options in the correct order, aligning with the man page rules.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model is valid, contains the necessary options, and does not violate any syntax or command structure as outlined in the ffmpeg documentation, it should pass the evaluation. The model's output fulfills the user's requirements, therefore the output is acceptable."
