  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the third audio track from a Matroska (.mkv) file and the first video track, and convert the result into an MP4 file, use the following command:\n\nTo extract only specific streams, navigate to the specified stream IDs for the video and audio streams.\n\n- -stream_id 0 specifies the first video stream (assuming primary audio and video exist; confirm via ffmpeg output).\n- -stream_id 2 specifies the third audio stream.\n\nFor extracting streams, set `-map_stream 0` for the first video (primary stream) and `-map_stream 2` for the third audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv \\\n  -map_stream 0 -\n  -map 2:0 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 \\\n  -map_metadata 0 -c:a aac -b:a 128k final.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n- `-map_stream 0` specifies the first video stream (assuming primary audio and video exist; using the default).\n- `-map 2:0` extracts only the 3rd audio stream.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 video codec.\n- `-crf 23` sets the quality (23 is a good default).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` utilizes AAC for audio encoding at 128 kbps.\n- `-map_metadata 0` copies bit_rate, size, time_duration to information in the final file.\n- Output file is final.mp4.\n\nPlease note, if your file has multiple audio streams and you want to pick the third audio stream (counting starts from 1 for streams), `stream_id 3`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains an issue. Specifically, it incorrectly uses the flag `-map_stream`, which is not a valid ffmpeg option. The correct flag to use for mapping streams is `-map`. Additionally, it does not specify that the outputs should use the format (`-f mp4`) if necessary.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nWhile the model's output does include some correct components, the usage of `-map_stream` instead of `-map` renders the command functionally incorrect, similar to how the example provided with the nonexistent preset would fail.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page because it uses `-map_stream` which is not a recognized option according to the ffmpeg documentation. The only valid option for specifying which streams to include in the output file is `-map`. Additionally, the model did not provide necessary resolution or format specifications for the output file.\n\n4) **Overall Conclusion**\nOverall, the model's output contains errors and does not correctly fulfill the user's request for an ffmpeg command. It did not adhere to the proper syntax or utilize valid command options, therefore it fails the evaluation."
