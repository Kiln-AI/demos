  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise, I'll use the `transpose` filter. It rotates counterclockwise by default, so I'll set it to `transpose=1` for a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n\nFor strong noise reduction, I'll combine the `hqdn3d` and `nlmeans` filters. The `hqdn3d` filter reduces noise using a 3D domain filter, and `nlmeans` applies a non-local means denoising algorithm. I'll be using the strongest values available for each.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=4:4:6,nlmeans=s=13:p=3:r=15\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file.\n*   `-vf \"...\"`:  Applies the video filters. Multiple filters are chained using commas.\n*   `transpose=1`: Rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n*   `hqdn3d=4:4:6`: Applies high-quality 3D denoise filter with luma strength 4, chroma strength 4, and temporal strength 6 (maximum values).\n*   `nlmeans=s=13:p=3:r=15`: Applies non-local means denoising. `s` is the search block size (13), `p` is the block size (3), and `r` is the search radius (15) -- strongest values for each parameter. Note that this filter is computationally intensive.\n*   `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n*   `output.mp4`: Specifies the output video file.\n\nImportant Considerations:\n\n*   **Computational Cost:** The `nlmeans` filter, particularly with the strongest settings, is computationally very intensive. Encoding will take a considerable amount of time.\n*   **Quality Tradeoff:** Aggressive noise reduction can soften the image and remove fine details. Adjust the filter strengths if you observe excessive detail loss.\n*   **Input File:**  I'm assuming your input file is named `input.mp4`, change this as needed.\n*   **Output Format:** The output file is `output.mp4`. The `-c:a copy` option assumes the audio is already in a suitable format for MP4. If it's not, you might need to add an audio encoding option like `-c:a aac`.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any apparent issues. The generated `ffmpeg` command seems appropriate for rotating a video 90 degrees clockwise and applying advanced noise reduction. The filters used (`transpose`, `hqdn3d`, and `nlmeans`) align with the user's request, and the command appears to be syntactically correct.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated is coherent and does not use any invalid options or presets. Each filter and option included in the command is valid according to the `ffmpeg` man page.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements outlined in the man page. The order of options is observed correctly, and all the options used (video filters, codec settings, etc.) are applicable according to `ffmpeg` standard usage. There are no syntactical errors or misuse of options in the command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output should pass as it does not contain the issue. The command is appropriate for the task and adheres to the correct usage of `ffmpeg` as described in the man page."
