  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode (burn in) subtitles into a video using `ffmpeg`, you use the `subtitles` filter. To make the subtitles yellow, you set the `force_style` option with `PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00&` (which specifies yellow in ASS/SSA format: &HAABBGGRR&).\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- `movie.mkv` is your input video.\n- `subtitles.srt` is your subtitle file.\n- You want to re-encode the video with hardcoded subtitles (burned in), in a new output file.\n\nExample parameters:\n\n- `-vf subtitles=...`: applies the subtitles filter.\n- `force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00&'`: sets the subtitles color to yellow (SSA color format).\n- `-c:a copy`: copies audio without re-encoding.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00&'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf your `ffmpeg` build lacks subtitle support, or the subtitles appear incorrectly, convert `subtitles.srt` to `subtitles.ass` first with a tool like `ffmpeg` or `Subtitle Edit`, then use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.ass\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nBut for direct SRT and yellow color, use the first command given above.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not seem to contain an obvious issue related to generating a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements. The command appropriately uses the `subtitles` filter to hardcode subtitles from the `subtitles.srt` file into the `movie.mkv` video file, and specifies the color of the subtitles as yellow.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model doesn't contain invalid options or incorrect parameters (such as a non-existent preset), and appears syntactically correct.\n\n3) The command provided in the model's output follows the ffmpeg man page's guidelines. The use of options appears to be in accordance with the expected format and sequence (with the input file specified before the output file). There are no options or parameters in the command that violate the requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output passes all evaluation steps and does not contain the issue described. The output successfully generates a correct ffmpeg command that fulfills the user's request to hardcode subtitles in yellow color."
