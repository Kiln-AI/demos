  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "The command allows ffmpeg to read the video stream with index 0 (stream 0:2) and the audio stream with index 1 (stream 1:3) separately, and then combine them. The following command uses default video and audio codecs and assumes an encoding of PCM audio (not directly available in \"stream\" output format), which we strive to match as closely as possible with alac:\n\n- `-i recording.mov` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:v` maps the video stream (stream 0) from input.\n- `-map 1:a` maps the audio stream (stream 1) from input.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a:1 aac` encodes the audio using AAC, which doesn't have specific audio streams like `stream` mode.\n- `-b:a 192k` sets maximum audio bitrate to 192kbps considering the source flavors.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v -map 1:a -c:v copy -c:a:1 aac -b:a 192k output.mp4\n```\n\nPlease note that a direct copy of `\"stream\"` mode to the standard output settings (`-c:a copy`) wouldn't be possible. Audio may struggle to maintain quality, hence we can set a higher bitrate. Adjust the bitrate as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue described in the issue description. The user input specifies combining video stream 0:2 with audio stream 1:3, but the output command incorrectly uses `-map 0:v` and `-map 1:a`, which do not properly address the specified streams (the correct mappings would be `-map 0:2` for the video and `-map 1:3` for the audio).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided, as the command does not include any obviously invalid parameters (e.g., mismatched options). However, the mappings used in the command do not correspond to the input given by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the man page, except for the incorrect usage of stream mappings. According to the FFmpeg command structure, each stream should be correctly mapped based on the user's specifications.\n\n4) Overall, the modelâ€™s output contains the issue described and thus does not fulfill the requirement of generating a command that works correctly according to the user's instructions. Therefore, it fails."
