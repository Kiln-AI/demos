  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. Here, you want to select video stream 15 and audio stream 22 explicitly. Note that stream numbering starts at 0, and the stream index should reference the input file's stream indices (i.e., `-map 0:15` and `-map 0:22` if these are input 0's streams).\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:15` selects the 16th stream from the first input (assuming it's video).\n- `-map 0:22` selects the 23rd stream from the first input (the desired audio).\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- `output.mkv` is the output file.\n\nAssumption: The streams you mentioned are indeed correctly identified as video and audio streams respectively in the input. If they're not, you might need to validate with `ffprobe` first.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select specific streams from the input file based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv`) correctly maps the specified video and audio streams without using any invalid options or codecs that do not exist.\n\n3) The command produced does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It adheres to the syntax and options set out for stream mapping and copying without re-encoding. All parameters used are legitimate and align with standard ffmpeg usage.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass and is correct in meeting the userâ€™s request for selecting specific streams from the input file. The explanation and assumptions made by the model were also appropriate, indicating considerations for stream index referencing and the potential need for validation of stream types. Overall, the generated command is reliable and functional according to ffmpeg's specifications."
