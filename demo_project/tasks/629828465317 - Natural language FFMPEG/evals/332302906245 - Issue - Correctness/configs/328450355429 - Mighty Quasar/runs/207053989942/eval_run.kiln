  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "To merge multiple input audio files (-cat or -map metadata) into a single FLAC file with the highest quality settings (-c:a libflac), while maintaining various configurations, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_audio1.wav -i input_audio2.wav -i input_audio3.wav -c:a libflac -b:a - -map_metadata 1 -f null -ar 48k -t 0 output FLAC\n```\n\n- `ac:libflac`: Use the FLAC audio codec.\n- `-b:a -`: Allow maximum bitrate, but given FLAC's default maximum bitrate is 100%, we allow no constraint.\n- `-map metadata 1`: Copy metadata from the leftmost input file (minimum time).\n- `-no-map 1` - 2,3 map 1 on, 2,3 map 2 off, just 1 and show metadata.\n- `-f null`: Instruct FFmpeg to create it automatically (the above requirement).\n- `ar 48k`: Output sample rate set to 48 kbps\n- `-t 0`: No minimum length for the file.\n\nAlternatively, `ffmpeg` has better options: `ac:libflac` (same as above). But `-ar 192000` on higher source samples might cause issues.  `ac:flac` adds `ac 48k`, it's recommended when better sample rate limitations are known. The best answer may use one of the values such as these:",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues in the generated FFmpeg command. The command is incorrect. It uses `-b:a -` which is not a valid option for bitrate when exporting audio. In fact, for FLAC format, there is no need to specify a bitrate limit since FLAC is a lossless codec. Additionally, the command is incorrectly formatted by having `-map_metadata 1 -f null -ar 48k -t 0 output FLAC`, which suggests the output is incorrect as written. The correct format would include the output file name directly rather than using `-f null`, which is misleading.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the specific example of a failing output, as the command produced by the model does have a valid structure. However, it contains incorrect flags or parameters that would cause it not to execute properly.\n\n3) The command does violate several constructs outlined in the man page for FFmpeg. \n   - The option `-b:a -` is incorrect for the FLAC codec, where specifying a bitrate is unnecessary and incorrect.\n   - The inclusion of `-f null` seems irrelevant to the user's request to merge and export audio to FLAC format.\n\n4) Given all the above evaluations, the model's output does contain significant issues with the command generated for FFmpeg. Therefore, it should be marked as failed based on the criteria set forth."
