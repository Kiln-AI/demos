  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your video file to a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream, you should use the `-b:v 25000000` option. This sets the video bitrate to 25 Mbps. \n\nNote: Bitrates in Mbps are common; ensure your username or system has read/write permissions on the output file. \n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000000 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264, a widely supported and efficient choice.\n- `-b:v 25000000` sets the video bitrate to 25 Mbps.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding for a fast and lossless transfer.\n\nAssumption: Your input video is named `input.mp4` and you want to keep the audio codec unchanged for faster processing and better quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correct options for setting the video bitrate and uses proper syntax. The parameters align with the user's request for a constant video bitrate of 25000k (25 Mbps).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command does not include any invalid options or syntactical mistakes, such as a nonexistent preset. The command structure is in line with what is expected from the ffmpeg usage.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used in the command are valid:\n   - `-i input.mp4` correctly specifies the input file.\n   - `-c:v libx264` is appropriate for setting the video codec.\n   - `-b:v 25000000` accurately sets the video bitrate to 25 Mbps.\n   - `-c:a copy` is valid for copying the audio stream without re-encoding.\n   All parameters conform to the specifications in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command follows the expected syntax, uses valid options, and meets the user's request without any errors, it passes the evaluation. The command crafted by the model should work correctly for the intended purpose."
