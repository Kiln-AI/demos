  "input": "Convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound using the cinema_quality preset and save as WAV",
  "output": "To upmix a stereo audio file to 7.1 surround sound and save it as a WAV file, you can use FFmpeg's `pan` audio filter, which allows you to map and mix audio channels. The `cinema_quality` preset likely refers to a high quality setting for AAC encoding, but since you want a WAV output (which is uncompressed PCM), we focus on high fidelity mixing and proper channel mapping.\n\nThe standard 7.1 layout in FFmpeg is:  \n`FL FC FR LFE BL BR SL SR`  \n(Front Left, Front Center, Front Right, Low Frequency Effects, Back Left, Back Right, Side Left, Side Right)\n\nIn this example, we will:  \n- Map the stereo channels (Left and Right) to all 7.1 channels except the LFE (which will be silent).  \n- Use equal distribution for \"surround\" channels as a baseline approach for upmixing.  \n- Output as 24-bit PCM WAV (`-sample_fmt s32` and `-acodec pcm_s24le`) for cinema-grade quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i stereo_input.wav -filter_complex \"\n[0:a]pan=8c|c0=c0|c1=0.6*c0+0.6*c1|c2=c1|\n          c3=0|c4=0.5*c0|c5=0.5*c1|c6=0.5*c0|c7=0.5*c1[aout]\" \\\n-map \"[aout]\" -ac 8 -sample_fmt s32 -c:a pcm_s24le -preset slow 7.1_output.wav\n```\n\nExplanation:  \n- `pan=8c|...`: Defines 8 channels. Each `cN` after the equal sign shows how each output channel is constructed from input channels `c0` (left) and `c1` (right).\n- Front center (`c1=0.6*c0+0.6*c1`) mixes both with slightly less gain.\n- LFE (`c3=0`) is silent (standard for upmixing unless you add bass management).\n- Surrounds and backs (`c4`, `c5`, `c6`, `c7`) get half amplitude from left/right.\n- `-c:a pcm_s24le -sample_fmt s32` ensures 24-bit uncompressed, cinema-quality WAV output.\n- `-preset slow` is ignored for WAV since it applies to compressed codecs, but kept here as a placeholder in case you adapt the command for other formats.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- Your input is `stereo_input.wav`, already uncompressed and 2-channel.\n- You want maximum channel quality for cinema use (24-bit, 8 channels, uncompressed).\n- The `cinema_quality` corresponds to uncompressed or high-bit-depth output, since WAV is required.\n\nIf your stereo input is a different format (e.g., MP3), just replace the input filename.\n\nLet me know if you want to add bass management or LFE content!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \n   The output does contain an issue. The model incorrectly included the `-preset slow` option in the command line. The `-preset` option is not applicable for WAV files, as it specifically relates to encoding settings for compressed codecs. Therefore, this inclusion does not align with the userâ€™s requirement of outputting a WAV file.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   The output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failing example demonstrates an invalid preset selection for a particular format, whereas the model's output includes a valid command structure but contains an irrelevant option for the specified output format (WAV). Thus, while there is a mistake, it does not share the exact nature of the failure in the example provided.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page, specifically the usage of the `-preset` option with uncompressed audio formats like WAV. Such a command should not include options that do not apply to the specified output format or codec.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   The model's output does contain the issue described because it incorrectly added the `-preset slow` option in the command for a WAV file output. Therefore, it should be classified as failing in terms of generating a command that works correctly and matches the requirements from the user."
