  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to map the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from their source file, complex.avi. Hmm, I need to figure out how to do that with ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, I remember that ffmpeg uses stream indices to select specific streams. The user mentioned the second video stream and the fourth audio stream. So, for video streams, the index starts at 0, right? So the second video stream would be index 1. Similarly, audio streams start at 0, so the fourth audio stream is index 3. But wait, I should confirm that the source file actually has at least two video streams and four audio streams. Otherwise, the command might fail. The user might not have considered that, so I should mention that as an assumption.\n\nNext, how to map these streams in the command. The -map option is used to specify which streams to include. So, for the second video stream, it would be -map 0:v:1, and for the fourth audio stream, -map 0:a:3. The input is complex.avi, so the input is 0. \n\nThen, the output. The user didn't specify the output format, so I'll assume they want the same format as the original streams. But maybe they want a specific container, like MP4. Wait, the original file is .avi, but maybe they want to convert it. However, the question is about mapping streams, not changing codecs. So maybe the output could be the same container, but sometimes it's safer to specify a container. But since they didn't mention, maybe just use the default. \n\nAlso, when mapping streams, it's important to ensure that the output has the correct number of streams. For example, if they're taking one video and one audio stream, the output will have those. But they need to make sure that the input has those streams. \n\nAnother thing: the user might not be aware that the stream indices are zero-based. I should mention that in the explanation. \n\nPutting it all together, the command would start with ffmpeg -i complex.avi, then -map 0:v:1 for the second video stream, -map 0:a:3 for the fourth audio stream, and then the output file. But they didn't specify the output file name, so maybe use complex_output.mp4 as an example. \n\nWait, the user might want to keep the same format, but .avi might not be the best container for multiple streams. But again, they didn't specify, so I'll proceed. \n\nI should also note that if the source doesn't have those streams, the command will fail. So the assumptions are that the file has at least two video streams and four audio streams. \n\nAlso, the user might not have considered the output format. Maybe they want to keep the same container, but if they do, sometimes using -c copy can be faster, but if they need re-encoding, they have to specify codecs. But since the user didn't mention, I'll assume they just want to copy the streams. So the command would be using -c:v copy and -c:a copy. Wait, but if they are mapping specific streams, maybe they want to re-encode them. Hmm, the original question is about mapping, not encoding. So perhaps using copy is better. But maybe the user wants to change codecs. However, since the question is about mapping, I think the answer should focus on mapping, not re-encoding. \n\nSo the final command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.avi\n\nBut I should check if the user wants to re-encode. But since they didn't specify, maybe it's safer to include the codecs. Alternatively, maybe they want to re-encode. But the question is about mapping, so I think the answer is to use the -map options and then copy the streams. \n\nWait, the user didn't mention output format, so maybe the output is the same as input. But perhaps it's better to use a common format like MP4. However, I should not assume that. So the output file name can be complex_output.avi or another format. But the user didn't specify, so I'll use a generic output name. \n\nAlso, in the explanation, I need to mention the assumptions: the file has at least two video streams and four audio streams, and that the user wants to copy the streams without re-encoding. \n\nSo putting it all together, the command includes the map options, and the codecs are copied. The output file is named with an example, like output.mp4, but the user can change it. \n\nI think that covers the necessary parts. Let me make sure I didn't miss any parameters and that the explanation is clear.\n</think>\n\nTo map the second video stream (index 1) and the fourth audio stream (index 3) from `complex.avi`, use `-map` to explicitly select these streams. By default, `ffmpeg` will use the first video and first audio streams unless specified otherwise. This assumes your input file contains at least two video streams and four audio streams (as stream indices are zero-based).\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index 1) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3) from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (faster and preserves original quality).\n- Output format is inferred from the file extension (e.g., `.mp4` or `.avi`). Adjust as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n1. The input file contains at least two video streams and four audio streams.  \n2. You want to copy streams without re-encoding (if re-encoding is needed, specify codecs like `-c:v h264 -c:a aac`).  \n3. Output format is `.mp4` (change to `.avi` or another format if required).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   The model's output does not seem to contain any issues with the ffmpeg command it generates. It correctly forms a command to map specific video and audio streams from the input file as per the user's request. Hence, it should pass this step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The failing example features errors in the usage of options (like a non-existent preset). In contrast, the model's command uses valid syntax and options consistent with the task requirements. Therefore, it should pass this step.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command adheres to all requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` to specify the desired video and audio streams is appropriate, and the output file is correctly proposed with an extension, assuming that the file naming conforms to valid conventions. The use of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` for copying streams without re-encoding, while not explicitly asked by the user, is a reasonable assumption based on common practices. Thus, the command passes this step as well.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. All parameters are properly utilized, and the command is both functional and closely aligns with the user's request. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
