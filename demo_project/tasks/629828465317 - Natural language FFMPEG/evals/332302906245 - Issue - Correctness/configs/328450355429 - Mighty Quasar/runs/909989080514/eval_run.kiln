  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract audio track 5 from input.mov and combine it with the original video stream, you need to:\n\n- Use ffmpeg's -map option to select video (0:v) and the 5th audio track (0:a:4).\n- Use -codec:v copy to keep the video unchanged (no reencoding).\n- Encode the audio (e.g., as AAC) for compatibility.\n- Put the output in a new .mov file.\n\nAssuming your input.mov has at least 5 audio streams (indices 0-4), this command will extract the fifth audio track and merge it with the video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:4 -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mov\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- -map 0:v picks the first video stream.\n- -map 0:a:4 selects the 5th audio track (audio index 4).\n- -c:v copy keeps the video stream as-is.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes the audio in AAC at 128 kbps (a commonly compatible format).\n- output.mov is the resulting file.\n\nThis approach ensures you include only the desired video and audio track(s) in the output, preserving the original quality of the video. If you need another output format, adjust the extension and audio options as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly utilizes the `-map` option to designate the appropriate video and audio streams, ensuring that it meets the user's request to extract audio track 5 while keeping the original video.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command given by the model is valid and utilizes appropriate options for stream mapping and codec selection without errors like an invalid preset. \n\n3) The command adheres to the specifications outlined in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly applies options in the right order and uses valid parameters. No requirements from the man page are being violated in the command provided. \n\n4) Considering all the above points, the model's output does not contain the issues described, nor does it generate an incorrect command. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
