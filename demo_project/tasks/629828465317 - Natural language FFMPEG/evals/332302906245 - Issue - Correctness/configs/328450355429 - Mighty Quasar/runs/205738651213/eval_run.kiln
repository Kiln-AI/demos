  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To maximize compatibility across all devices, you should encode your video using the widely supported H.264 video codec with the AAC audio codec. Use the baseline profile for H.264 for devices with lower processing power (like older smartphones and some media players). Enable faststart (-movflags +faststart) for web streaming and set pixel format to yuv420p for broad compatibility.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c:v libx264`: H.264 video encoding, best universal compatibility.\n- `-profile:v baseline -level 3.0`: Limits the complexity to maximize device support.\n- `-crf 23`: A good balance between quality and file size.\n- `-preset medium`: Balanced encoding speed and compression.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures compatibility with older screens and players.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Widely supported AAC audio at 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Moves MP4 metadata to start of file for streaming.\n\nAssumption: Input filename is `input.ext` and output will be `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -crf 23 -preset medium -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output of the model does not appear to contain any issues based on the user requirements. The command generated is appropriate for achieving maximum compatibility across devices by using widely supported codecs (H.264 and AAC) and settings that optimize compatibility. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing output example. The command uses valid options and does not include any non-existent presets or incorrect syntax. The command also adheres to the specifications indicated in the user input.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command generated by the model does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. All options used are valid and appear in the documentation, and they follow the correct syntax and order, ensuring that parameters are applied to the appropriate output file.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command and the accompanying explanation are both appropriate and valid, fulfilling the user's request of converting the video to work on all devices with maximum compatibility settings."
