  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the third audio stream and the first video stream from the input file `movie.mkv`, we'll use the `-map` option to select the desired streams. Note that stream indices start at 0, so the first video stream is `-map 0:v:0` and the third audio stream is `-map 0:a:2`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a aac final.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream (index 0) from the input file (`movie.mkv`).\n* `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (index 2) from the input file.\n* `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding (to preserve quality).\n* `-c:a aac` encodes the audio stream using the AAC codec, which is widely supported in MP4 files.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input file `movie.mkv` is a Matroska container with multiple audio streams and at least one video stream.\n* The third audio stream is the one you want to extract.\n* You want to encode the audio stream using AAC codec, if you want to use another codec or settings, you can change the `-c:a` option.\n\nNote that this command assumes that the first video stream is the one you want to extract. If you want to extract a different video stream, adjust the `-map 0:v:0` option accordingly (e.g., `-map 0:v:1` for the second video stream).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly maps the first video stream and the third audio stream from the input file `movie.mkv` to the output file `final.mp4`. It also includes appropriate codec settings for the output formats. The command aligns well with the user's requirements, indicating the model has produced a valid command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. It does not misuse options like the example's use of a non-existent preset. Instead, the command uses valid and properly structured options. Thus, there are no parallels with the provided failure example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any documented requirements in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options are applied correctly; the `-map` options accurately select the required audio and video streams, and the codec options utilized are valid. The use of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a aac` is also in alignment with standard practices for preserving the video quality while encoding audio in a widely supported format.\n\n4) Since the explanation and command generated by the model adhere to the expected criteria, it passes the evaluation without any identified issues."
