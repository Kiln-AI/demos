  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 file with an exact video bitrate of 5000 kbps, you can use `-b:v` to specify the target bitrate and `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` for controlling variable bitrate (VBR) behavior. MP4 compatibility is ensured by using H.264 with `libx264`. Locking the bitrate precisely requires setting both `-b:v` and `-maxrate`, `-bufsize` to match.\n\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the target bitrate to 5000 kbps.\n- `-maxrate 5000k` enforces maximum bitrate, controlling VBR.\n- `-bufsize 10000k` (twice the maxrate) provides buffer for rate control, a common practice.\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies H.264 encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies original audio stream; change only if needed.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original audio stream without re-encoding, or specify a particular audio codec if desired.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as it generates a valid ffmpeg command based on the user's request. The provided command is structured correctly and fulfills the requirement for a VBR setting with a locked bitrate of 5000 kb/s.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, as the command produced is syntactically correct and uses valid parameters that adhere to the ffmpeg standards. There are no nonexistent options or keywords used in the command.\n\n3) The command produced by the model adheres to the requirements set out in the ffmpeg man page. The options used in the command (`-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`) are all valid and correctly applied. The order of the options does not cause any conflicts or misunderstandings in the command's execution.\n\nTherefore, the model's output passes the evaluation as it successfully generates a correct ffmpeg command without any issues."
