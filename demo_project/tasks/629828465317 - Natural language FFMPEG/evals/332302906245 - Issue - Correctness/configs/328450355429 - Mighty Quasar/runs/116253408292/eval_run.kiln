  "output": "**Chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for your shaky footage.**\n\nTo achieve this, we'll use the following steps:\n\n1.  **Stabilization**: Use the `libvifx` filter to stabilize the shaky footage. This filter adjusts the chroma keyframe from the source video to a target video with the same temporal alignment. It can handle a single frame as the input frame, so we'll use it as the source frame.\n2.  **Color Grading**: Apply a color grading effect to the stabilized footage. We'll use the `colorcorrection` filter to apply a color correction effect. This filter allows us to apply a range of color grading effects, including color balance, contrast, and more.\n3.  **Geometric Transformation**: Finally, apply a rotation and scaling transformation to the stabilized and color graded footage. We'll use the `crop` filter to scale the footage and the `rotate` filter to rotate it.\n\nHere's the corresponding `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \\\n  \"libvifx=0:v-time=10:1:v-dpf=nearest(pan=1:pan=1)\", \\\n  colorcorrection=bt709=1:1:15, \\\n  crop=iw-ih:20:20, \\\n  rotate=1:0.5:0:1.5, \\\n  scale=iw*2:ih*2, \\\n  colorcorrection=bt709=1:1:15 \\\n  output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   The input video `input.avi` is a shaky footage that needs stabilization and color grading.\n*   We want to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio for the output video.\n*   We're targeting a 1080p resolution for the output video (1920x1080).\n*   The color grading effect should apply a standard BT.709 color space with a gamma of 1.5 and a white point of 5500K.\n*   The rotation and scaling effect should rotate the footage by 30 degrees and scale it by a factor of 2.\n\nNote that this command assumes a frame rate of 25 FPS. If your frame rate is different, you'll need to adjust the `v-time` parameter accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues with the `ffmpeg` command it generated. Specifically, several of the filters used (such as `libvifx` and `colorcorrection`) do not exist in `ffmpeg` as presented. This means that the command is unlikely to work correctly or at all, which violates the requirement of generating a command that works correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is indeed similar to the failing output example, as it generated a command that includes options that do not exist or are incorrectly named, leading to the likelihood of failure. For example, `libvifx` is not a standard ffmpeg filter, resulting in an erroneous command.\n\n3) The command breaks several requirements from the `ffmpeg` man page:\n   - The filters `libvifx` and `colorcorrection` do not exist in the FFmpeg filter documentation, meaning they cannot be used as stated, which leads to an invalid command.\n   - The parameters for `rotate` and `crop` do not conform to the expected syntax for these filters, further implying a misunderstanding of their correct usage.\n\nIn conclusion, based on these evaluation steps, the model's output fails in generating a valid `ffmpeg` command as required by the user's request, thus it contains the described issue and does not meet the standards expected from the task."
