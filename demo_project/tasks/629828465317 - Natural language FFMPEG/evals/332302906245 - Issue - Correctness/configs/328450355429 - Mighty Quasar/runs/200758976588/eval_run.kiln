  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "To maximize compatibility, you can create a multi-stream video file that contains both an H.264 (libx264) and an H.265 (libx265) video stream within the same container (commonly MKV or MOV, since MP4 supports only one video stream by standard).\n\n- The two encoders are specified with -map commands to encode the original video twice: once with libx264 and once with libx265.\n- Sharing the same audio track for both streams.\n- Output file should be MKV for widest support with multiple video tracks.\n\nHere's the command to accomplish this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -c:v:0 libx264 -map 0:v -c:v:1 libx265 -map 0:a? -c:a copy -metadata:s:v:0 title=\"H.264/AVC\" -metadata:s:v:1 title=\"H.265/HEVC\" output.mkv\n```\n\n**Explanation of key parameters:**\n- `-map 0:v -c:v:0 libx264`: Encodes the first video stream to H.264.\n- `-map 0:v -c:v:1 libx265`: Encodes the first video stream again, this time to H.265.\n- `-map 0:a? -c:a copy`: Copies all audio streams (if present).\n- `-metadata:s:v:0` & `-metadata:s:v:1`: Label the video streams for easy identification.\n- `output.mkv`: MKV container supports multiple video streams.\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- Your input file has a single video and (optionally) single audio stream.\n- You want to copy existing audio as-is.\n\n**Notes:**\n- Not all players will auto-select the preferred stream; many will default to stream #0 (H.264), ensuring compatibility.\n- File size will roughly double, as you store two compressed video tracks.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It successfully generates an ffmpeg command that adheres to the task requirements of creating a video with both libx264 and libx265 codecs in a single output file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. There are no incorrect parameters or commands in the generated ffmpeg command that would lead to an execution failure. The output command appears to be well-structured and follows the correct syntax.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It successfully uses the `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` options in a valid manner, aligning with how options should be applied according to the input/output structure outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output meets the requirements of the task, utilizes appropriate parameters, and adheres to the man page guidelines, it can be determined that the model has performed well on this task and does not contain any issues. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
