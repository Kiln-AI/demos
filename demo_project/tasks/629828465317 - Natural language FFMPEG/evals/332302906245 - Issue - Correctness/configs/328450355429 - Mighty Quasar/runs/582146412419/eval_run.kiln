  "input": "Help me create a complex filter that resizes, adds border, and applies motion blur. Use -vf 'scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black;mblur=radius=3' for the transformations.",
  "output": "To perform multiple complex video transformations with ffmpeg, you can chain filters in a single -vf (video filter) argument. \n\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the input video to exactly 1920x1080 pixels.\n- `pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black` ensures the output is 1920x1080 with a black border if the scaled video is smaller; in this case, it's mostly redundant if input is scaled directly to 1920x1080 but can be useful if you want borders added after motion blur.\n- `mblur=radius=3` applies a motion blur with a radius of 3 pixels.\n\nSince your input dimension is scaled directly to the target resolution, the `pad` filter here is optional; you can remove it unless you want to add additional borders. Note that motion blur will be applied after scaling.\n\nHere is a clean ffmpeg command with these filters chained using `-vf`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080,mblur=radius=3\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- Audio is simply copied without re-encoding to keep speed and quality intact.\n- Replace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with your actual filenames.\n\nIf you want to retain borders around the scaled video (e.g., if scaling changes aspect ratio and you want black borders), you probably want:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black,mblur=radius=3\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis will explicitly resize then ensure the output is 1920x1080 with borders preserving aspect ratio, then apply motion blur.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is a standard video file compatible with ffmpeg.\n- The motion blur radius of 3 is desired; increase for stronger effect.\n- Audio is to be preserved (won’t be processed unless specified).\n- Output uses default codecs; you can specify encoder parameters per your needs.\n\nLet me know if you want to encode the video with specific codecs or settings!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue. The command produced by the model is appropriate for the user's requirement, which was to apply multiple filters (scale, pad, and motion blur) to the video. The filters were correctly interpreted and the command generated should yield the expected results based on the input provided by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The model’s output is **not** similar to the failing example. The command `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails because \"extra_fast\" is not a valid preset; however, the command produced by the model uses valid filters and follows the appropriate syntax, ensuring that it should work as intended.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command produced by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The use of `-vf` to apply video filters is appropriate and correctly formatted. Furthermore, the parameters used such as `scale`, `pad`, and `mblur` are valid filters and options recognized by FFmpeg. There are no violations of order or syntax, and the command adheres to the expected structure as outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Based on the detailed evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass."
