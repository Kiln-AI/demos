  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To extract the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the `input.mov` file and combine them into a new file, we need to use the stream mapping with `-map`. We will keep the original video's framerate by using `-f concat` and write the output streams without re-encoding them (`-c:a copy -c:v copy`).\n\nHowever, this is a common misconception; in FFmpeg, it is not typical to map streams individually and expect a coherent output without rendering. The command provided actually produces a `.txt` file holding the mapping instructions (`concat` filter) instead of directly streaming the requested video and audio streams together. If a single input means all desired streams should be included in one output and not a separate concatenated file, a different approach is needed.\n\nHere is the complete `ffmpeg` command:\n\n- `-i INPUT.mov` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0 -map 6:v -map 14:a` takes the 7th video (indexing starts from zero), the 14th (index started from 1 for the audio) video, and the 14th audio stream.\n- `-f concat` triggers the concat format; however, it would normally result in a new file that concatenates multiple clips together.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n\nHowever, to simply map the streams as requested without any expectation to use the output immediately, you might end up with a non-frame-concatenated stream like so, but note that this won't create a single, continuous video/audio stream without using some concat demuxer (or even with one since -f concat doesn't line up well for just video and audio):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0 -map:v 6 -map:a 14 -c copy -f null - | sed 's/combining null stream/; /'' -743\n```\n\nThis command reads the specified video and audio streams, combines them into a null device (just to pass the command internally), and then use `sed` to format the combined streams for placeholder layout. You will need Frame de-muxer / muxer to play them correctly, and `-743` de-loader doesn't work with x264 or any stream, hence an illustration of mistake in command generation.\n\nPlease clarify if you want the streams concatenated (over multiple files, one for each which typically requires re-encoding or variable bitrate encoding) or if simply mapping non-contiguous specific streams into a single file without modifying them is indeed the request.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command it generated is problematic because it suggests using `-f concat` but does not specify that this requires a proper concatenation format (typically for multiple files) rather than mapping individual streams in a single output file without properly manipulating the streams. The user asked for mapping specific streams, not concatenation, making the advice inappropriate for the task.\n\n2) The model's output is different from the <failure_example>. While both examples contain errors, the structure of the command generated by the model is somewhat valid in terms of syntax. The issue lies more in the logic of the command as it misinterprets the user's request.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements stated in the ffmpeg man page. Specifically, the concatenation command is misapplied. The usage of `-f concat` suggests that the user is working with multiple files or segments, which is not the case per their request. The model should use stream mapping directly instead of trying to concatenate inappropriately. Given the user's request, the focus should have been on correctly mapping the desired streams without the concatenation format.\n\n4) Conclusion: The model's output does contain the stated issue, as it misapplies the use of the concat functionality rather than addressing the user's exact request to simply map multiple streams into a new output file. Therefore, it fails the evaluation."
