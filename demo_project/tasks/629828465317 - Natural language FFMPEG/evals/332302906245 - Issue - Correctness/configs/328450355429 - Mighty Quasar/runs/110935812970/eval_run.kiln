  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from your video (`video.avi`) every 2 seconds as ultra high-resolution PNG images:\n\n- The `-vf fps=1/2` filter grabs one frame every 2 seconds.\n- PNG encoding preserves the highest possible quality.\n- The output filename pattern (`frame_%04d.png`) auto-numbers the images.\n- \"Ultra high resolution\" assumes you want to keep the original video resolution; `ffmpeg` by default wonâ€™t downscale or upscale unless specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 -q:v 1 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nIf your video contains resolutions above standard HD, the images will maintain that resolution. If you need to upscale to a specific resolution, add `-vf \"fps=1/2,scale=WIDTH:HEIGHT\"` (replace WIDTH and HEIGHT as needed).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly provides an `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's request to extract frames every 2 seconds from a video. The command utilizes the correct video filter `-vf fps=1/2`, which extracts one frame every 2 seconds, and appropriately outputs to PNG images without downscaling or upscaling, thereby preserving the original video resolution based on the handle \"ultra high resolution.\" Hence, the output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is based on valid `ffmpeg` options and syntax. There are no mistakes like using a non-existent preset or incorrect options, which would result in a failure of the command.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements stated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The usage of `-vf fps=1/2` correctly sets the frame rate for extraction, and the output specification for PNG images is valid. The command follows the rule of specifying input options before the input file and output options before the output file, which ensures it will run without issues.\n\n4) Given that the model's output adheres to the user's request and the `ffmpeg` documentation requirements without introducing errors or invalid options, it does not contain the issues described and therefore passes the evaluation."
