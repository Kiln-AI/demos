  "input": "Convert my 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset and copy the audio stream without re-encoding",
  "output": "To convert a 4K video to 1080p while maintaining maximum video quality, the `veryslow` preset is a good choice for the x264 encoder. Copying the audio stream without re-encoding is done with `-c:a copy`. Assuming the input is any video file and you want an MP4 output.\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080\" -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Containment**: The model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The generated FFmpeg command correctly addresses the user's request to convert a 4K video to 1080p, utilize the `veryslow` preset, and copy the audio stream without re-encoding. Therefore, it matches the user requirements without any mistakes in the command.\n\n2) **Comparison to Failure Example**: The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. The command is correctly structured, and all options used are valid in the context of FFmpeg usage. It follows the proper syntax, including the correct preset and audio codec handling. Thus, it does not exhibit the same flaws as the failing output showcased.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used are valid:\n   - `-vf \"scale=1920:1080\"` correctly sets the output resolution.\n   - `-c:v libx264` specifies the video codec appropriately.\n   - `-preset veryslow` uses a valid preset.\n   - `-c:a copy` accurately copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n   The command adheres to the outlined options and expected syntax in the man page.\n\n4) **Overall Evaluation**: Since the model's output does not contain any issues as described, does not resemble the failing example, and is compliant with the FFmpeg man page requirements, it passes the evaluation criteria. The command is valid and fulfills the user's request correctly."
