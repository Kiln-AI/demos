  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add a new subtitle track and remove all existing subtitles, we use precise stream mapping to exclude original subtitles. Assuming the input has a video and audio stream (with subtitles #0:s if present, removed by not mapping them), and the new subtitle file is in SRT format, here's the command:\n\n- `-map 0:v -map 0:a` selects video and audio from the first input.\n- `-i` includes the new SRT subtitle file as the second input.\n- `-map 1:s` maps the subtitle stream from the second input (ensuring one new track).\n- `-c copy` retains video/audio codecs unless re-encoding is required.\n- `-c:s mov_text` converts the new SRT to a subtitle format compatible with MP4 containers (requires re-encoding).\n- `-metadata:s:s:0 language=eng` sets the new subtitle's language metadata.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt \\\n  -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s \\\n  -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text \\\n  -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng \\\n  output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n1. The new subtitle file is named `subtitles.srt` and in standard SRT format.\n2. The language for the new subtitle is English ('eng'). Adjust as needed for actual language.\n3. Audio/video codecs remain unchanged with `-c copy`. Modify these if re-encoding is required for final format consistency.\n4. We're outputting to MP4, which requires the `mov_text` subtitle codec. For MKV/WebVTT output, the approach would differ.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain any issues described in the given description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is well-structured, adheres to the user's request to add subtitles while removing existing tracks, and utilizes proper stream mappings to achieve this without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options like the `extra_fast` preset mentioned. All the options used in the command are valid and correspond to typical usage of `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. All parameters used are correctly applied, options are well-structured, and the mapping of input and output streams follows the rules stated in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output successfully meets the task requirements and generates a valid command for the input it was given. Therefore, it should **pass** based on the evaluation criteria, having no issues with the command generation or syntax compliance."
