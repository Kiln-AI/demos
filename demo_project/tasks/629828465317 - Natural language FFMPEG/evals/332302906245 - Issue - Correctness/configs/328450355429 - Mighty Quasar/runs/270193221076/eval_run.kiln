  "output": "To extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream from the MKV file `movie.mkv` and save them into a new MP4 file `final.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include.\n\n- `-map 0:v` selects the first video stream (stream index 0).\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (stream index 2, since audio streams start at index 0).\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding, which is faster and preserves quality.\n- `-movflags +faststart` helps with streaming by placing metadata at the beginning of the MP4 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated accurately fulfills the user's request to extract the third audio track and the first video stream from the given MKV file and produce the output in MP4 format. All specified streams are correctly addressed with their appropriate indexes, and the options used are valid.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any invalid options or syntax errors that would cause it to fail. The options used in the command are correct and appropriate for what the user requested.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The usage of `-map 0:v` and `-map 0:a:2` follows the correct stream mapping syntax, and the options `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to copy streams without re-encoding are valid. Based on the explanations and the references to the man page, the command adheres to all stipulated rules and conventions.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described in the initial evaluation condition. It successfully generates a correct command that meets the user's requirements. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
