  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To set a very high video bitrate of 100,000 kbps (100 megabit/s) and a high audio bitrate of 512 kbps, you should use the -b:v and -b:a options for video and audio bitrate, respectively. For video encoding at such a high bitrate, it is best to use a fixed bitrate instead of CRF.\n\nThe command below demonstrates how to do this. Note that at 100,000 kbps, the file size will increase dramatically, and playback may be limited on most typical consumer hardware.\n\n- -b:v 100000k sets the video bitrate to 100 mbps.\n- -c:v libx264 uses H.264 encoding (change -c:v libx265 for higher efficiency if supported by your player).\n- -minrate 100000k and -maxrate 100000k ensure a constant bitrate.\n- -bufsize sets the buffer size for bitrate control (multiply by 2x bitrate for optimal compatibility).\n- -b:a 512k sets the audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n- -c:a aac uses AAC encoding for audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100000k -minrate 100000k -maxrate 100000k -bufsize 200000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k -movflags +faststart output_highbitrate.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file is input.mp4.\n- Output file will be output_highbitrate.mp4.\n- H.264 is used for wide compatibility; adjust codec as needed.\n- -movflags +faststart is included for quick web playback if intended.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is logically constructed to fulfill the user's request for a high bitrate video and audio conversion. All specified parameters are valid and appropriately used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The output command is well-structured and utilizes valid parameters. There are no incorrect flags or options present in the command.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (-b:v, -minrate, -maxrate, -bufsize for video and -b:a for audio) are valid and correctly applied to their respective output streams. The command also describes the intended functionalities properly.\n\nIn summary, the model's output correctly addresses the user's request without any errors, follows the appropriate syntax for ffmpeg commands, and aligns with the established practices of ffmpeg usage. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
