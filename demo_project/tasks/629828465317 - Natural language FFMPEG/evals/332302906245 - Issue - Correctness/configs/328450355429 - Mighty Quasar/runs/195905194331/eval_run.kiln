  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you use the `-map` option to choose the desired streams by their index. Stream numbering starts from 0, so video stream 12 and audio stream 25 can be selected directly with `-map 0:12` and `-map 0:25` (assuming there is only one input file, which is `0`).\n\nHere's the command that copies those selected streams without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -map 0:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command assumes you want to preserve the original codecs (`-c copy`) and container format (`.mkv`). If you want to re-encode or change formats, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the input file `recording.mkv`. The usage of `-c copy` indicates that the model has preserved the original codecs without re-encoding, which is appropriate for the task described by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output provided. The generated command is valid and does not use any incorrect or non-existent parameters. \n\n3) The command in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It adheres to the necessary syntax and options for mapping streams from the input file, and it correctly utilizes the `-map` option according to the rules described.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
