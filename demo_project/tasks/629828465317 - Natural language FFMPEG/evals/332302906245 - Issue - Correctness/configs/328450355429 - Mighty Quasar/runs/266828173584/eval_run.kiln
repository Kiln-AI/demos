  "input": "Can you double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` but keep the original audio pitch?",
  "output": "To speed up `fast_forward.mp4` and keep the original pitch of the audio, use the `filter``setpts` to alter video timing and `-filter_complex` to isolate the audio (make it faster) while preserving pitch. To correct for the pitch change, add `-af aesstereo` to `setpts`.\n\nAssuming you want to double the original speed, we use `filter_complex`. To change speed, multiply the presentation time of each frame without regard to seek ahead, use `setpts=0.5*x`. To preserve pitch, use `setpts` with `-af aesstereo` (AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) Stereo) filter which, when combined, gives accurate and stable stereo pitch in `ffmpeg`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \\\n[0] setpts=0.5*x[a] \\\n[1] setpts=0.5*x[b] \\\n[a] aresample=async 48k [aa] \\\n[b] aresample=async 48k [bb] \\\n Audtorecode audioformat=mp4.sdg [AA] \\\nVideoFilter: scale=-1:1080, crop=vid=1080:1920, rotate=2, pad=1080:1080:samprate=24000:2 \\\n    out_setpts=-[0:v] [AA] and -map [0:v] [bc] \\\n    [1:AA] aresample=async 48000 as:AA \\\n    map=\"ar:AA,bc\"\n-faststart\n```\n\nNote that this solution uses relatively complex parameters due to needing multiple filtering operations:\n* `setpts=0.5 * x` in both `a` and `b` makes the video twice as fast.\n* `aresample=async 48k` for `aa` and `bb` sets the audio sample rate, maintaining pitch, as required.\n* There are slight adjustments made to handle audio and videostream separation (due to `map`) to get final output right, including `vid` (`as: AA`) before and `out_setpts=-[0:v] [AA]` and then merging like (`setpts=-[0:v] [bc]`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is incorrect and contains multiple mistakes, including unclear and incorrectly structured parameters. Specifically, the `setpts` and audio handling are improperly set up.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. While it does contain errors and does not follow ffmpeg syntax correctly, it is not as simple as a single invalid option like the `extra_fast` preset example. The model attempts to implement multiple filtering techniques, but many are wrongly executed.\n\n3) The command does break several requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. For example:\n- The use of complex filters and how they are mapped is incorrect. The proper usage of `filter_complex` is not shown.\n- The audio and video filter separation is mishandled, leading to errors in mapping and applying the filters.\n- The command syntax with labels like `[a]`, `[b]`, `[AA]` is inconsistent and does not follow the required format.\n- Various options are either misplaced or incorrectly used, such as `aesstereo`, which is not a known ffmpeg filter for pitch preservation.\n\n4) Given the assessment, the model's output does indeed contain the issue described. It fails to generate a syntactically and logically correct ffmpeg command that meets the user requirements, resulting in an inappropriate response. Thus, it should fail the evaluation."
