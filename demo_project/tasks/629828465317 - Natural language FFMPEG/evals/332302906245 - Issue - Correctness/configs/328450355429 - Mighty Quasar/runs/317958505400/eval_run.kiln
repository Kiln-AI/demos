  "input": "I need to convert a video file and set the bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps for archival purposes.",
  "output": "Converting a video file to have a bitrate of exactly 64 Tbps (terabits per second) for archival purposes involves using the Constant Bit Rate (CBR) mode and setting the bitrate accordingly. However, note that achieving such an extremely high bitrate is rarely feasible or practical due to massive file sizes and hardware limitations. For instance, the fastest consumer SSDs might not be able to keep up with read/write speeds of such an enormous bitrate. \n\nTo create a video with such a high bitrate, you'd want to use a lossless codec or an intraframe codec (since they have high bitrates and low compression ratios), such as FFV1. For the audio part, a high bitrate, lossless audio codec can be used, like FLAC.\n\n- `vb 64T` would set the bitrate to 64 terabits per second, if CBR mode was supported and if possible.\n- `c:v ffv1` sets the video codec to FFV1 for a lossless and potentially high bitrate encoding.\n- Assuming a fixed high bitrate (1.5Gbps here), use `vb 1500000000`. Adjust as feasible for requested CBR or with the `maxrate` and `bufsize` settings for other rate control methods.\n- `-c:a flac` selects a lossless audio codec to support the archival purpose.\n- `-ar` (audio sampling rate) and `-ac` (number of audio channels) settings might also need to be specified for high quality archival.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v ffv1 -vb 1500000000 -c:a flac output.mkv\n```\nKeep in mind that:\n\n1.  Achieving exactly 64 Tbps is almost certainly infeasible with current technology due to bandwidth limitations, storage capacity and huge sizes of files generated.\n2.  Lossless encoding is practically very large in size.\n3.  Appropriate settings are kept unknown (instead use `maxrate`, `bufsize`) to eliminate hardcoding unsustainable CBR value.\n\nAs exported here, settings accounted into the revised code aren't very helpful at a simply a requested CBR or with return unpractical considerations.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command fails to conform to practical limitations regarding bitrate settings, as it specifies a bitrate of 64 Tbps, which is infeasible with current technology and usage contexts. \n\n2) The output does not closely resemble the failure example regarding an invalid preset. However, it introduces an invalid idea (64 Tbps bitrate) for a practical scenario and would fail to work correctly in terms of functionality and performance.\n\n3) The command does break requirements from the man page as it attempts to set an impractical and unsupported bitrate. FFmpeg can accept specific bitrates, but 64 Tbps is beyond the capabilities of current encoding hardware and software standards, effectively making the command non-functional.\n\nOverall, the model's output fails to adequately address the user's request concerning practical and technical feasibility while also providing a command that is effectively unusable due to the extreme bitrate specified."
