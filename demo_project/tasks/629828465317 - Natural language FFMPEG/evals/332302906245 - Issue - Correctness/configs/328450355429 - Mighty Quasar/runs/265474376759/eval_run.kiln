  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "A bitrate of 50 Gbps is **~100×** higher than even 4K Blu-ray; 50 Gbps equals **≈ 6.25 GB per second** of data. At that data-rate the final file will exceed the throughput of common SSDs, and most players / containers will refuse it. Nonetheless, if you truly want to “store everything” at that mark, you can use a mathematically lossless codec or a dummy CBR target set to 50 G. Below I’ll show the brute-force syntax while warning how impractical it is.\n\nI am keeping color-subsampling yuv444p (best quality but rarely playable), no audio (you never specified audio), and using Matroska (.mkv) because FFmpeg’s MP4 muxer will not let you go past ≈ 40 Mbps without extra work. The real bottleneck will be reaching ~6.25 GB/s to disk, so I also add `-max_interleave_delta 0 -flush_packets 0` so FFmpeg buffers the burst writes.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov \\\n-c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv444p10le \\\n-b:v 50000000000 \\\n-bufsize 50000000000 \\\n-maxrate 50000000000 \\\n-preset ultra \\\n-f matroska -max_interleave_delta 0 -flush_packets 0 \\\noutput_50Gbps.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as it does not consider the extreme impracticality of setting a video bitrate to 50 Gbps. The command is syntactically correct and uses valid parameters, but the choice of bitrate is excessively high, given that it would produce a file size that far exceeds typical storage and playback capabilities. It fails to properly address the user's request by providing a feasible solution.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output as it does not contain an invalid command or non-existent options like `preset extra_fast`. The command generated by the model uses valid parameters, but the concerns regarding practicality and performance are relevant.\n\n3) The command does not explicitly break any requirements dictated in the man page, as all options used (such as `-b`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, etc.) are valid and formatted correctly. However, the bitrate chosen (50 Gbps) is extraordinarily high and would lead to practical issues during encoding, playback, and storage.\n\n4) Considering all points discussed, the model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. While the command itself is technically correct syntax-wise, it provides impractical settings for the requested transformation, which fails to match the expectations of what the user would reasonably want in terms of file output. Thus, it should fail the evaluation on those grounds."
