  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the first video stream and the third audio stream from `movie.mkv` and save it as `final.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream (index 0) from the first input file (index 0). `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (index 2) from the first input file (index 0). Note that stream indexing starts at 0. Copy codecs are used to remux the file without re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command seems correct and valid according to the user’s requirements. It accurately extracts the first video stream and the third audio stream from the specified input file and outputs them into a new file.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain any mistakenly specified options or non-existent parameters. The usage of `-map` to select streams is correct.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. The use of `-map` to specify the streams (0:v:0 for the first video stream and 0:a:2 for the third audio stream) is correct and follows the indexing rules. The selected input and options are consistent with the documented commands and expected behaviors of FFmpeg.\n\nBased on the evaluation of the model's output against the specified criteria, **the model’s output successfully meets the requirements** of the user’s request, is constructed correctly, and does not contain any mistakes. The command is also compliant with the requirements as indicated in the FFmpeg documentation."
