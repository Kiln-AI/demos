  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "A multi-step transformation! To chain together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformation, we'll use FFmpeg's filtergraph syntax. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Stabilization**: Use the `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` filters to analyze and stabilize the footage. We'll assume you want to use the \"trans\" method for stabilization, which is a good balance between effectiveness and speed.\n2. **Color grading**: Apply a color grade using the `curves` filter. For a simple example, let's say you want to increase contrast and adjust the black/white points. You can modify the `curves` parameters to suit your taste.\n3. **Geometric transformation**: Rotate and scale the footage using the `rotate` and `scale` filters. We'll assume you want to rotate the footage by 45 degrees clockwise and scale it to 80% of its original size.\n\nHere's the command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result='transforms.trf'; \\\n        vidstabtransform=input='transforms.trf':smoothing=30:optzoom=0:crop=1, \\\n        curves=contrast=1.2:preset=medium:blaclimit=0.01:whitelimit=0.99, \\\n        rotate=45*PI/180, \\\n        scale=0.8*iw:-1\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n\n* Your input file is `input.mp4`.\n* You want to write the output to `output.mp4`.\n* You're using the H.264 codec for video encoding (`libx264`).\n* You're copying the original audio (`-c:a copy`).\n* The `vidstabdetect` filter is configured with reasonable parameters for detecting camera shakiness.\n\nNote that the `vidstabdetect` filter requires a temporary file (`transforms.trf`) to store the stabilization data. Make sure you have write permissions in the current working directory.\n\nThis command will apply the stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformation in the specified order. Adjust the filter parameters to fine-tune the results!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?** \nThe output does not appear to contain the issue described. The generated command is elaborate and uses the appropriate parameters, filter configurations, and assumes reasonable defaults based on the userâ€™s input. The command seems structured correctly according to the FFmpeg syntax.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is complex, makes use of multiple filters in a valid manner, and does not contain any obviously incorrect parameters or options being used inappropriately.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nAnalyzing the command in detail shows that it follows the syntax and guidelines provided in the FFmpeg man page. There are no syntax errors, and the use of `-vf` to apply multiple filters is appropriate. Each parameter appears correctly applied to the next specified file, and the options used comply with the documented functionality.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nBased on the analysis, **it does not contain the issue** described. The command is valid, and it meets the user requirements for chaining together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations while properly formatting the command in FFmpeg. Thus, it is judged to be correct and should work as intended."
