  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To stabilize footage, apply color grading, and perform geometric transformations such as rotation and scaling, you can chain multiple filters using ffmpeg's filtergraph syntax. \n\n- The `vidstab` filters are used for stabilization, typically requiring a precomputed transform or the `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransforms` filters.\n- Color grading can be done with filters like `colorlevels`, `eq`, or `colorbalance`.\n- Geometric transformations such as rotate and scale are handled with the `rotate`, `scale`, or `transform` filters.\n\nHere's an example assuming you want to stabilize first, then color grade, then rotate and scale:\n\n- You should perform stabilization first to reduce shakiness.\n- Followed by color grading adjustments.\n- Finish with geometric transformations.\n\nAssumption: you have a precomputed transform file for stabilization, or you can include the detect/transform pipeline directly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"[0:v]vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result=transforms.log,vidstabtransform=smooth=5:input=transforms.log,eq=brightness=0.05:saturation=1.2,rotate=PI/6:ow=iw*1.2:oh=ih*1.2\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to do all in a single chain without precomputed transforms, it typically isn't practical for stabilization. For a more complete example with precomputed transforms, you'd first run:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=15:result=transforms.log\" -f null -\n```\n\nthen:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=smooth=5:input=transforms.log,eq=brightness=0.05:saturation=1.2,scale=1280:720,rotate=PI/6\" -c:a copy stabilized_and_graded_scaled.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:** Replace the parameters with values suitable for your desired stabilization strength, color grading, and transformation. The order of filters is important: stabilization filters first, then color grading, then geometric transforms.\n\n---",

    "chain_of_thought": "The evaluation process can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command appears to be correctly composed and should work correctly according to the requirements outlined in the task.\n\n2. Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?\nThe output does not resemble the failing example given. The command generated by the model is contextually relevant and uses parameters that are indeed valid in ffmpeg, rather than a nonexistent option.\n\n3. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command constructed by the model adheres to the requirements laid out in the ffmpeg man page. The filters used (vidstabdetect, vidstabtransform, and color correctors/adjustments) are indeed valid, and the chaining through the filter graph syntax is proper as well.\n\n4. Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nBased on the evaluation, the output does not contain the issue, meaning it should pass the performance evaluation successfully."
