  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles and remove existing subtitle tracks, use the `-i` option to specify the input file, the `-map_metadata`, `-i` for the subtitle file, `-sub_lang` to specify the language, `-force_subtitles` to force the extraction of thumbnails for newly added subtitles, and `-c copied` to copy the embedding metadata, setting the resolution, audiochannel layout, and bitrate. \n\n-map_metadata is crucial when both subtitling the video with a new file AND forcing extracting of thumbnails from that subtitles has been done for the video and this command option allows you to embed all the necessary information for proper displaying on the host system. \n- Using `copy` for audio doesn't apply here due to the already described situation.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map_metadata 1 -i subtitles.srt -subLang <SRT Lang: en> -force_subtitles 1 -c:v -c:a -c:s copy output.mp4\n```\nNote:\n*   Assuming the main video file has no embedded subtitles to avoid a runtime error `Subtitles have not been successfully generated`\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map_metadata 1 -i subtitles.srt -subLang <SRT Lang: en> -force_subtitles 1 -c:v -c:a -c:s copy output.mp4\n```\nAssuming the target audio codec is `copy`, but you usually add `-c:a en` explicitly to display subtitle information correctly in `ffmpeg` output.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues in the ffmpeg command that do not conform to what is required by the user. The command does not effectively address the task of adding subtitles as well as removing existing subtitles in a straightforward way. There are ambiguous and incorrect options used such as `-force_subtitles`, which doesnâ€™t exist in the context it was implied to. Additionally, the use of `-map_metadata 1` and other parameters does not align clearly with the task of simply adding subtitles while discarding existing ones.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example. The command provided does not represent valid ffmpeg syntax due to the presence of nonexistent options like `-force_subtitles`. This indicates a misunderstanding in how to structure the command correctly.\n\n3) Looking at the man page for ffmpeg, the command breaks multiple requirements. It improperly uses options like `-map_metadata` and incorrectly attempts to convey forcing the addition of subtitles. The descriptions provided do not align with valid syntax for either adding subtitles or removing existing subtitles. The command fails to adhere to the order of options stipulated in the man page, which is crucial for proper execution.\n\nIn summary, the model's output contains significant issues, and it fails to generate a correct command as required by the task. Therefore, it does contain the issue described in the provided evaluation criteria."
