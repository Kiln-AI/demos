  "output": "To transcode input.mp4 to AVI using VP9 with 2-pass encoding, you'll need to run two separate ffmpeg commands. VP9 2-pass encoding analyzes the video in the first pass to optimize bitrate allocation in the second pass, resulting in better quality and more consistent file sizes.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` specifies VP9 video codec\n- `-b:v 1M` sets target bitrate (adjust as needed for your quality requirements)\n- `-pass 1` and `-pass 2` indicate the respective encoding passes\n- `-passlogfile pass1` creates a log file for pass coordination\n- `-f null -` in pass 1 discards output since we only need the analysis\n- `-c:a libvorbis` uses Vorbis audio codec (common pairing with VP9)\n- `-threads 4` uses 4 threads (adjust based on your CPU)\n\nI'm assuming you want a bitrate of 1 Mbps - adjust the `-b:v` value based on your quality needs (higher for better quality, lower for smaller files).\n\n```bash\n# First pass\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1M -pass 1 -passlogfile pass1 -threads 4 -f null -\n\n# Second pass\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1M -pass 2 -passlogfile pass1 -c:a libvorbis -threads 4 output.avi\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The commands generated are appropriate for the task of transcoding a video to AVI using the VP9 codec with 2-pass encoding. The model correctly specifies the necessary parameters for both the first and second pass of encoding, and the logic behind 2-pass encoding is clearly explained.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The commands generated correspond to valid options and parameters for ffmpeg and do not invoke an option that does not exist. Thus, they do not share the same characteristic as the problematic command example.\n\n3) The commands generated do not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used such as `-c:v libvpx-vp9`, `-b:v`, `-pass`, and `-passlogfile` are all valid options documented in the man page. The use of `-f null -` in the first pass to discard the output while analyzing the video also complies with the guidelines outlined.\n\n4) Given the above assessments, the model's output does not contain the issue described and it adheres to the requirements. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
