  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your video with a constant bitrate (CBR) of 25000 kbps for the video stream, we'll use the `b:v` option to set the video bitrate. Here's the ffmpeg command:\n\n- `b:v 25000k` sets the video bitrate to 25000 kbps.\n- `c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 codec for video encoding.\n- `preset fast` speeds up the encoding process.\n- `c:a aac -b:a 128k` uses the AAC codec for audio with a bitrate of 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart` places metadata at the start of the output file to enable faster streaming.\n\nWe assume you want to maintain the original resolution and aspect ratio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nMake sure to replace `input.mp4` with the actual input file path and `output.mp4` with your desired output file name.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command provided appears valid and matches the requirements specified by the user, who requested a conversion with a constant bitrate for the video stream set to 25000 kbps. The output correctly uses `-b:v 25000k` to set this bitrate. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The generated ffmpeg command does not include any incorrect options, such as an invalid preset name, and all specified parameters are valid within the context of ffmpeg usage.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters used are consistent with the documented options for ffmpeg, such as `-b:v` for setting video bitrate and `-c:v` for specifying the codec. The responsibilities of the options are clearly explained, and they follow the correct order of input and output specifications.\n\nBased on the above evaluations, the model's output is correct and adheres to the expected requirements. The command should work properly without any issues."
