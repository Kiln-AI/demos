  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply these filters in the specified order (temporal → spatial → edge enhancement), you'll need to chain them properly using FFmpeg's filtergraph syntax. I'm assuming this is for video processing with the hqdn3d filter for both temporal and spatial denoising, followed by an edge enhancement filter.\n\n- **hqdn3d** provides both temporal (luma & chroma temporal thresholds) and spatial (luma & chroma spatial thresholds) denoising in a single filter\n- **unsharp** for edge enhancement (positive values sharpen, negative values blur)\n\nThe thresholds for hqdn3d are: `luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_temporal:chroma_temporal`. You'll want to tune these values based on your source material - lower values = weaker denoising.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5,unsharp=5:5:1.5:5:5:0\" output.mp4\n```\n\nThis sets moderate denoising values followed by light edge enhancement:\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5` = spatial denoising (luma=4, chroma=3) + temporal denoising (luma=6, chroma=4.5)\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.5:5:5:0` = edge enhancement with matrix size 5x5 and strength 1.5 (only luma sharpening, chroma=0)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated is syntactically correct and matches the requirements from the user, who requested a specific order of filters (temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is properly formatted and does not contain misspecified options such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The filters used (hqdn3d and unsharp) are valid as per the ffmpeg documentation, and the way they are chained together in the command is correct.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the task input, and it successfully generates a valid and appropriate ffmpeg command based on the user's requirement. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
