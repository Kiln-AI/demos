  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To add blurred bars to the sides of a vertical video to make it 16:9 widescreen, I'll use a technique that scales the original video to create a blurred background, then overlay the original video centered on top.\n\nThis approach:\n- Creates a blurred, scaled version of the video as the background\n- Overlays the original vertical video centered on top\n- Results in a 16:9 aspect ratio with blurred side bars that match the video content\n\nI'm assuming you want 1920x1080 as the output resolution (standard 16:9). The blur intensity is set to 20 - you can adjust this value higher for more blur or lower for less blur.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=1920:1080,boxblur=20[bg];[0:v]scale=-1:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease[fg];[bg][fg]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThe filter breakdown:\n- `scale=1920:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=increase,crop=1920:1080,boxblur=20[bg]` creates the blurred background\n- `scale=-1:1080:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease[fg]` scales the original to fit within 1080p height\n- `overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2` centers the original video on the blurred background",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly matches the user's request to add blurred bars to a vertical video (`story.mov`) to transform it into a widescreen (16:9) format. The command utilizes proper filtering techniques and parameters that align with the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output. The command it produced does not contain any erroneous flags or parameters. All specified filters and actions are valid and applicable to the task described by the user.\n\n3) The command does **not break any requirements** dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All used options, such as `-filter_complex`, `scale`, `crop`, and `overlay`, are valid and applied correctly. The method of constructing the output from a blurred background and overlaying the original video adheres to the syntax and functionality as described in the man documentation.\n\n4) Given that the command is functional, follows the requirements from the user, and adheres to the ffmpeg documentation without errors, it should **pass** the evaluation. The model's output correctly fulfills the task as intended."
