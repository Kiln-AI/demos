  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode (burn-in) subtitles from an SRT file into a video, you can use the `subtitles` filter in ffmpeg. To change the subtitle color to yellow, you can create a subtitles style override directly in the filter.\n\nThe technique:\n- Use `-vf subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'` to burn subtitles with a yellow color.\n- The color code is in BBGGRR format (`&HAABBGGRR`), so yellow is `&H00FFFF00` (alpha 00, blue FF, green FF, red 00 in BGR order, yellow means red+green).\n- Input file is `movie.mkv`, output can be output.mkv (or any desired container).\n- No re-encoding of audio video codecs is assumed, so we set `-c:a copy -c:v libx264` for video re-encoding to burn in subtitles, audio copy.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\nThis command hardcodes yellow subtitles onto the video from the SRT file, re-encoding the video to H.264 with a reasonable CRF for quality and copying audio unchanged.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command provided for hardcoding subtitles into a video is correctly formatted and adheres to the user's request to change the subtitle color to yellow.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mkv`) does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters like the `extra_fast` preset, which does not exist.\n\n3) The ffmpeg command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used are valid, and the overall command structure follows the correct syntax as described. The parameters for hardcoding subtitles and the codec settings are appropriate for the task.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, therefore it passes evaluation. The generated command is valid and matches the requirements from the user without syntax errors or the use of invalid options."
