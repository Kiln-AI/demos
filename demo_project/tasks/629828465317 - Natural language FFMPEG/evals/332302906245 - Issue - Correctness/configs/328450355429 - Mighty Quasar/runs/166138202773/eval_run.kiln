  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from broadcast.mkv and save them into a new MP4 file, you can use the -map option to select the desired streams, and copy the codecs without re-encoding for efficiency. Since MP4 typically requires specific codec support, if you encounter compatibility issues, you might need to re-encode, but copying avoids unnecessary decoding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file contains streams with indexes 0:4 and 0:9.\n- Audio codec in the trimmed output can be compatible with MP4 or re-encode if needed (you can specify -c:a for re-encoding).\n- No other streams are desired.\n\nCommand explanation:\n- -i broadcasts.mkv specifies the input file.\n- -map 0:v:4 selects video stream 0 with index 4.\n- -map 0:a:9 selects audio stream 0 with index 9.\n- -codec copy copies all selected streams without re-encoding to bypass quality loss and reduce processing time.\n- The output container is .mp4 (standard for this combination of streams).\n\nIf re-encoding is required (e.g., for incompatible audio codec, or to ensure MP4 compatibility), specify the codecs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcasts.mkv -map 0:v:4 -codec copy -map 0:a:9 -codec copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nIf re-encoding is needed:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcasts.mkv -map 0:v:4 -codec copy -map 0:a:9 -codec:a libmp3towers -b:a 192k trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nReplace libmp3towers with any compatible codec as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "The evaluation of the model's output with respect to the provided task proceeds as follows:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output generates a command that correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams. It also appropriately uses `-codec copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding unless necessary. This aligns well with the user's requirement to extract specific streams, which indicates that there are no apparent errors in the command structure. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output does not resemble the failing output example, which contained an invalid parameter (`-preset extra_fast`). In contrast, the model's command is valid and makes use of existing and correct ffmpeg options. Thus, the comparison indicates a successful generation.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command as designed follows the syntax expected for `ffmpeg` commands, specifying input and output files correctly, using the `-map` option to select streams, and utilizing `-codec copy` appropriately. There are no conflicts with any requirements in the ffmpeg man page, such as option order or required syntax. Thus, the command complies with the specifications outlined in the man page.\n\n   **Result: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is valid and conforms to the requirements laid out by the user and in the documentation.\n\n   **Final Assessment: Pass**"
