  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect on your video, you'll need to chain multiple video filters using the `-vf` option. The syntax for chaining multiple filters is by separating them with a comma (`,`).\n\nHere's an example:\n\n* `drawtext`: this filter is used to overlay text on your video. You can specify the text itself (`text=Example`), the font size (`fontsize=30`), the font color (`fontcolor=white`), and the position of the text (`x=10:y=10`).\n* `blur`: this filter is used to apply a blur effect to your video. You can specify the blur sigma (`sigma=2.0`) and the blur radius (`radius=3`).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text=Example:fontsize=30:fontcolor=white:x=10:y=10, blur=sigma=2.0:radius=3\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nHowever, to achieve the exact desired effect, you might want to specify the blur area. This involves adding another filter (`mask`) before the `blur` filter. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text=Example:fontsize=30:fontcolor=white:x=10:y=10, \nmask='tapoaeuka 0', \nmaskedBlur=sigma=2.0:radius=3:unsharp=0:enable='between(t,2,4)-between(t,4,6)'\">\n-c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Based on the provided evaluation steps, here is the assessment of the model's output:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \n   Yes, the ffmpeg command provided by the model includes a syntax that is not valid. The use of `maskedBlur` and `mask` are not standard filters in ffmpeg. Instead, the simple blur can be applied directly without needing to mask, thereby invalidating the output. Additionally, the initial command for `blur` lacks support in the standard ffmpeg filter list which would likely lead to an error.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   While not identical to the example of a failing output, the model's explanation of the command doesn't match the user's requirement of chaining video filters correctly since the second command contains non-standard filter terms, which could also lead to failure.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the 'maskedBlur' and 'mask' filters do not appear to be valid according to the requirements and options detailed in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `maskedBlur` is particularly problematic as it doesn't conform to standard ffmpeg filters and would result in the command failing.\n\n4) **Conclusion**: The modelâ€™s output fails because of incorrectly suggested filters that are not recognized by ffmpeg. Therefore, it does contain the issue described, and hence it should fail in the evaluation."
