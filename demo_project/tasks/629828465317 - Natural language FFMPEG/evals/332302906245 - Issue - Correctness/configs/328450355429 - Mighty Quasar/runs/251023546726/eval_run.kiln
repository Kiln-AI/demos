  "output": "To select specific streams from a complex media file and combine them into a single output, you can use the `-map` option in FFmpeg.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` maps the 7th video stream from the input file (0-based indexing, so the 7th stream is at index 6).\n- `-map 0:a:13` maps the 14th audio stream from the input file (0-based indexing, so the 14th stream is at index 13).\n- `-c copy` copies the video and audio streams without re-encoding, as we're only re-multiplexing the streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mkv\n```\nAssumptions made:\n- The file container supports multiple streams (like MKV, MOV, or TS). If you want a different output container, replace `.mkv` with your desired file extension.\n- The selected streams are compatible with the chosen output container. If you encounter any compatibility issues, you may need to re-encode the streams using a different codec.\n- The input file has at least 7 video streams and 14 audio streams. If it doesn't, the command will fail due to out-of-range indexing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from the input file using proper indexing (0-based). The command generated is valid for the requirement stated by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options like `-preset extra_fast`. The command is logically consistent with user requirements and follows the proper FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It uses a valid syntax for specifying input files, mapping streams with `-map`, and copying codecs with `-c copy`. The command is structurally correct according to the example provided in the man page. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It has correctly generated a valid FFmpeg command that is compliant with the user's request and the FFmpeg man page. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
