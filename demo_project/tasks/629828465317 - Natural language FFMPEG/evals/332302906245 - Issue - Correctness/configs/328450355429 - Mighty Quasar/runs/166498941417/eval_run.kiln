  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "The request to transcode to AVI using the `libvp9` codec with 2-pass encoding involves a few considerations. AVI is not a standard container for VP9 (libvpx), and most AVI players may not support it. However, if you still want to proceed, the `libvpx` codec (VP9 implementation in FFmpeg) can be used with 2-pass encoding, which involves running the encoder twice: one for analysis and one for actual encoding. Audio is typically re-encoded to a compatible format (e.g., MP3 or AAC), but the user hasn't specified, so it defaults to copying if possible.\n\n### Key Parameters:\n- `-c:v libvpx`: Specifies VP9 video encoding.\n- `-pass 1` / `-pass 2`: Enables 2-pass encoding (requires two separate runs).\n- `-b:v`: Sets the target video bitrate (adjustable).\n- `-passlogfile`: Stores log data for the two-pass process.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies audio stream to maintain compatibility (if possible).\n\n### Caveats:\n- AVI may not support VP9; consider using `mkv` instead for compatibility.\n- 2-pass requires two runs: first with `-pass 1`, then with `-pass 2`.\n\n```bash\n# First pass (analyze)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -pass 1 -b:v 1M -passlogfile two_pass_log -c:a copy output.avi\n\n# Second pass (actual encoding)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -pass 2 -b:v 1M -passlogfile two_pass_log -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\n**Note**: The container format (AVI) might limit compatibility. For better support, use `mkv` or `mp4` instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the provided criteria:\n\n1. **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does indicate a significant potential compatibility issue due to using the `libvp9` codec with an AVI container, which is not standard for VP9. It correctly mentions that AVI players may not support VP9. However, the main task of generating a functional FFmpeg command is fulfilled in the sense that the commands provided are syntactically correct. The output does a good job of explaining the limitations and caveats regarding the choice of the container format. Therefore, while it addresses potential issues, it still provides commands that could fail in terms of playback compatibility, but not in their execution.\n\n2. **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the provided output does not resemble the failure example. The commands generated are valid FFmpeg commands and do not invoke non-existent options or syntactical errors, as seen with `-preset extra_fast` in the failure example.\n\n3. **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The commands don't break any necessary rules dictated by the man page as they are constructed according to the guidelines provided for two-pass encoding and codec specification. However, the output does suggest an unconventional combination of codec and container, which could hinder playback rather than generating incorrect commands.\n\n4. **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does not entirely meet the expected task in the context of media compatibility, despite being syntactically correct. While the commands will run, the user might face issues with playback on standard AVI players. Thus, this should be marked as a \"fail\" because the output does not produce a command that will work correctly in all circumstances and matches the userâ€™s complete request effectively. \n\nIn conclusion, while the commands generated are valid, the model should have addressed the incompatibility more strongly and recommended a more suitable container format, thus leading to a 'fail' for not aligning entirely with the user requirements."
