  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo extract and remux the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the input file **complex.avi**, you can use stream selective remuxing without re-encoding (faster processing) or stream copying if the target container supports it (e.g., MKV or MP4 with appropriate codecs).\n\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (index 1 in streams of type \"v\": video).\n- `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3 in streams of type \"a\": audio).\n- Using `-c:v copy -c:a copy` avoids re-encoding, but only works with container formats that support all streams' codecs.\n- If the output format doesn't support the original codecs, you can re-encode on the output (e.g., with H.264 and AAC, common in MP4).\n\nAssuming you want MP4 output with common codecs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Ensures compatibility with most browsers and devices.\n- Uses fast x264 encoding, good quality CRF 23, and standard audio bitrate.\n- Sets pixel format for most player compatibility.\n\nIf you want to preserve original codecs (-c:v copy -c:a copy), output to a container like MKV:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output successfully provides a valid `ffmpeg` command that achieves the user's request to map the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the source file `complex.avi`. It uses `-map 0:1` and `-map 0:3` for the video and audio streams, respectively. The command also mentions a fallback for codec compatibility. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. It correctly uses valid stream mapping and codec options, while the failure example featured an incorrect preset (`extra_fast`) that does not exist. The model's output uses appropriate and existing options within the `ffmpeg` command.\n\n3) The command generated by the model is not in conflict with the `ffmpeg` man page requirements. It follows the syntax rules properly and uses parameters correctly. Both the mapping of streams and codec options are appropriate, and it suggests valid output formats (MP4 and MKV) based on codec capabilities.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the described issue, does not resemble a failing output, and adheres to the requirements laid out in the `ffmpeg` man page, it is considered correct and fulfills the user's request accurately. Therefore, the evaluation passes on all counts."
