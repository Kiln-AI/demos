  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from `broadcast.mkv`, and save them as `trimmed.mp4`, ffmpeg's `-map` option is used to include only the desired streams.\n\n- `-map 0:4` selects video stream 0:4 from the input.\n- `-map 0:9` selects audio stream 0:9.\n- `-codec:v copy` and `-codec:a copy` copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding, preserving quality and reducing processing time.\n- This approach assumes both the video and audio streams are already in a format compatible with MP4 (e.g., H.264 for video, AAC for audio).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -codec:v copy -codec:a copy trimmed.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance, I will analyze the output against the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**  \nThe model's output successfully provides a valid `ffmpeg` command to extract specific video and audio streams from the input file and save them to the output file. No syntax or logical errors are present in the command. Thus, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**   \nThe command generated by the model does not resemble the failure example given. The example `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` contains a nonexistent preset, which would cause it to fail. In contrast, the model's command is syntactically correct, and it correctly uses valid `ffmpeg` options and syntax, ensuring it would execute successfully.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**   \nReviewing the command against the man page for `ffmpeg`, everything adheres to the described options and their usage:\n   - The `-map` options (0:4 for video and 0:9 for audio) are correctly used to select specific streams.\n   - The `-codec:v copy` and `-codec:a copy` commands are correctly specified to avoid unnecessary re-encoding, which aligns with the described practices in the man page. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**   \nSince the model's command is correct and follows the guidelines provided in the man page without syntactical or logical errors, it does **not** contain the issue. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation. \n\nIn conclusion, the model was successful in generating a valid `ffmpeg` command based on the user input."
