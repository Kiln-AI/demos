  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "Removing the audio from a video file without re-compressing the video stream can be done by using the `-c:v` and `-c:a nul` options in `ffmpeg`. The `-c:v` option specifies the video codec with its parameters, and `-c:a nul` tells ffmpeg not to process any audio stream or to create a null (no audio) audio stream. The command below will strip the original video stream if no additional video codecs settings are provided (thus preserving the original video's compression), leaving you with just the video without audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a nul output_no_audio.mp4\n```\n\nIn this command:\n\n- `-i video_only.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding, which means no new codec settings are applied to the video.\n- `-c:a nul` disables the audio stream, effectively removing it from the output.\n- `output_no_audio.mp4` is the name of the output file after removing the audio.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a nul output_no_audio.mp4`) is correct and effectively removes the audio from the video without re-compressing the video stream as per the user's requirement. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command provided in the output utilizes valid parameters and options based on ffmpeg's functionality, and there are no incorrect options (such as nonexistent presets) present.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the general usage syntax and applies the required options correctly. Specifically:\n   - `-i video_only.mp4` specifies the input file.\n   - `-c:v copy` instructs ffmpeg to copy the video codec, thus retaining the original video quality and avoiding re-compression.\n   - `-c:a nul` effectively removes the audio stream, complying with the user's request to strip audio.\n\n4) Given the evaluation of the command based on the above criteria, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command meets all requirements and successfully addresses the user's request. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
