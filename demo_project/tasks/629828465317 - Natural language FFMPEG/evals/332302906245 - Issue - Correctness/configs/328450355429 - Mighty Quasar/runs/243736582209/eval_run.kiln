  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert raw\\_footage.mxf to an MP4 with a target bitrate of 5000 kb/s using VBR (Variable Bitrate), you can use the following command. The key here is specifying `-b:v 5000k` to set the video bitrate. I am assuming you want to maintain the original resolution and audio settings, and that the audio stream should be copied. If you want to change those, please let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly addresses the user requirement to convert a video file to MP4 format with a locked bitrate of 5000 kb/s using Variable Bitrate (VBR). The parameters used in the command are valid and execute the desired task as specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The produced command is valid and does not include any nonexistent options or parameters that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. Specifying `-b:v 5000k` is a correct method for setting the video bitrate, and using `-c:a copy` properly keeps the original audio stream without altering it. \n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues and accurately meets the user's request while adhering to the ffmpeg command syntax and requirements. Thus, it should pass this evaluation."
