Since MP4 requires H.264 video and AAC audio for compatibility, the command transcodes these streams to ensure the output is playable in MP4 containers.\n\n- `-map 0:v:3`: Selects the 4th video stream (`v` for video, 0 for the first input file, and 3 as the stream index).\n- `-map 0:a:5`: Selects the 6th audio stream (`a` for audio, 0 for the first input file, and 5 as the stream index).\n- `-c:v libx264`: Transcodes video to H.264 (MP4-compatible).\n- `-c:a aac`: Transcodes audio to AAC (MP4-compatible).\n- Assumes the user wants the streams to be re-encoded for MP4 compatibility (since direct remuxing might fail if codecs are unsupported).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac edited.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command accurately reflects the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from the input file to create a new output file, and the command presented is syntactically correct and logically sound for the task at hand.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output, such as the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`. The command generated by the model correctly uses existing FFmpeg options, including valid stream mapping and codec specifications.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used are appropriately applied according to the standards described, and the mappings are correct according to the provided stream indices in the input file.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. Therefore, it should pass."
