  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in sequence with FFmpeg, you create a filter chain using commas to separate filters. The filters will be applied in the order you list them.\n\nA typical approach is:\n\n1. Temporal noise reduction (e.g., using `tmix`, `hqdn3d` for temporal + spatial, or `nlmeans` for temporal).\n2. Spatial denoising (e.g., `hqdn3d` spatial part, `nlmeans` spatial, or `atadenoise`).\n3. Edge enhancement (e.g., `unsharp` or `edgedetect` followed by enhancement).\n\nExample using `hqdn3d` for denoising (which can do temporal + spatial), then `unsharp` for edge enhancement:\n\n``` \n-vf \"hqdn3d=luma_spatial=3:chroma_spatial=3:luma_tmp=6:chroma_tmp=4, unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=2\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `hqdn3d` parameters: `luma_tmp` and `chroma_tmp` control temporal denoising strength; `luma_spatial` and `chroma_spatial` control spatial denoising.\n- `unsharp` applies edge sharpening after denoising (parameters can be adjusted).\n\nIf you want a strict sequence with separate temporal then spatial filters, you may combine `tmix` or `nlmeans` for temporal, then `removegrain` or others for spatial, followed by `unsharp`.\n\nExample chain:\n\n``` \n-vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 2 3 2 1', hqdn3d=3:3:0:0, unsharp=5:5:1.0\"\n```\n\nHere:\n- `tmix` averages across 5 frames (temporal smoothing).\n- `hqdn3d` used only for spatial denoise (temporal parameters zero).\n- `unsharp` for edge enhancement.\n\nSummarizing, the syntax is:\n\n``` \n-vf \"input_filter, temporal_filter, spatial_filter, edge_enhancement_filter\"\n```\n\nAdjust parameters based on the source noise and desired strength.\n\nIf you share specific filters you want to use or desired parameters, I can tailor the exact command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description. It provides a potential ffmpeg filter chain but does not give an entire command that includes input and output file specifications, which are crucial for the command to be run correctly. Therefore, this output does not fully meet the user's requirement for a complete ffmpeg command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. While it does not provide a complete command, unlike the failure example which incorrectly uses an unavailable preset, it does list valid filters and provides partial information on how to chain them. However, it does not provide a complete functional command which can be executed as is.\n\n3) The command snippets shared by the model do not break any explicit requirements based on the provided man page for ffmpeg; they use valid syntax for filter chains, but without a full command structure that includes input and output specification, they cannot be executed.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does contain the issue described, as it lacks a complete ffmpeg command that would work correctly, thus failing to meet the user's expectations."
