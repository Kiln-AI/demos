  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "To merge multiple audio tracks into one file using ffmpeg, you should first identify how many audio tracks are in your input file (e.g., \"input.mkv\" here), and then combine them. Once combined, export the result as high-quality FLAC by setting FLAC encoding options for best quality.\n\nHere's the approach:\n1. Use `ffprobe` to count the number of audio streams.\n2. Use `ffmpeg` to merge the audio tracks with `-map 0:a:all` (to pick all audio tracks).\n3. Use `-c:a flac` for FLAC encoding and `-preset` for good compression balance.\n4. Set `-compression_level` or use `.info` for best quality defaults if you pass `-crf` with a really low value but it's less common.\n\nFor best quality, you typically want `crf` around 0 or less (not used for FLAC), or higher quality can be set via `-compression_level` or `-compression_limit`. We'll use `-compression_level 5` which balances quality and size.\n\nHere is a generic template that assumes you know the video and output file name and number of audio tracks. Replace \"input.mkv\" and \"output.flac\" as desired.\n\n**Step 1: Count audio streams**\n```bash\nffprobe -hide_banner -show_streams -hide_version -loglevel error input.mkv\n```\n\n**Step 2: Extract audio metadata for merge**\n\nAssuming 'track1', 'track2', ... audio tracks found, and output.flac name used:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:a:all -c copy output.flac -compression_level 5\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:a:all` selects all audio streams.\n- `-c copy` copies audio streams without re-encoding, merging them directly.\n- `-compression_level 5` preserves lossless quality for FLAC.\n  \nIf you want to specify actual high compression (smaller size), you could increase `compression_level` (2-10). For best quality, `1` is lossless, but files are much larger.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:a:all -c copy -compression_level 2 output.flac\n```\n\nThis outputs a high-quality high-compression FLAC that balances size and audio quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains issues with the generated ffmpeg command that does not satisfy the user's requirements properly. The primary concern is that the user asked to merge multiple audio tracks and export them using the \"studio_master\" preset, but the response refers to a generic preset option (`-preset`) that does not apply to FLAC encoding. The `-compression_level` is incorrectly utilized as well; while it exists for FLAC, it is usually specified as `-compression_level`, not as a preset.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output given (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) because the command structure is syntactically correct, i.e., it doesn't contain non-existent options. However, it incorrectly applies concepts related to video presets to audio command generation.\n\n3) The command does not break any explicit requirements laid out in the FFmpeg man page regarding syntax and available options. However, it does misuse the audio encoding requirements by trying to apply the `-preset` option which is not applicable to FLAC audio encoding. \n\nOverall, the command does not fully align with user requirements and makes incorrect assumptions about preset usage in audio encoding, indicating it does contain the issue described. The model's output should have directly referenced how to implement the \"studio_master\" preset correctly, if it exists within the context of audio coding. \n\nThe output fails to adequately meet the user's request for usage of the `studio_master` preset, thus it fails in the evaluation."
