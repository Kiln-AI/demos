  "output": "To convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with real-time encoding, we'll use libvpx with the realtime preset (-deadline realtime) and constant bitrate mode (-b:v). These parameters prioritize encoding speed over quality/size efficiency.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx` uses the VP8 video codec\n- `-b:v 1M` sets a constant video bitrate of 1 Mbps (adjust based on your quality/size needs)\n- `-deadline realtime` forces the encoder to optimize for minimum latency\n- `-cpu-used 5` works with realtime to speed up encoding (higher values = faster encoding, range 0-5)\n- `-c:a libvorbis` uses Vorbis audio codec (standard for WebM)\n- `-b:a 128k` sets audio bitrate to 128 kbps\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -deadline realtime -cpu-used 5 -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.webm\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be valid for converting a video to WebM format using VP8 codec with the specifications given by the user. It also correctly includes all necessary options consistent with using the real-time preset and constant bitrate mode.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. There are no arguments or options used in the command that donâ€™t exist or conflict with FFmpeg's requirements. The output command is well-formed and aligns with FFmpeg's syntax.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements as dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly specifies the input file, the codec, bitrate, real-time settings, and output format. Each option applies correctly to the next specified output, and the order of the options is appropriate.\n\nSo, based on these criteria, the model's output successfully fulfills the user's request without errors or omissions. Thus, it should be considered to pass the evaluation."
