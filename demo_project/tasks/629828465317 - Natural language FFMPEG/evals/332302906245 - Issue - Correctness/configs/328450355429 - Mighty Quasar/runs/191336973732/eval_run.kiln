  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles to your video file and remove all existing subtitle tracks, you need to perform two main operations:\n\n1. Use the subtitle filter to overlay subtitle streams onto the video. (`-vf \"subtitles=...\"`)\n2. Remove all existing subtitle tracks using the `-c:s` option (set subtitles codec to none to drop them). The subtitles filter should be fed from a subtitle file (for example `subs.srt`).\n\nHere is an example assuming your video is `input.mp4` and subtitles are in `subs.srt`:\n\n- -c:v copy copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- -c:a copy copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- -c:s mov_text selects the mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2 subtitle codec for mp4 container.\n- -map to keep or discard tracks as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subs.srt -c:v copy -c:a copy -vf \"subtitles=subs.srt:force_style='FontName=Arial,FontSize=24'\" -c:s mov_text -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s? output_with_subtitles.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation for advanced users:\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subs.srt\"` maps `subs.srt` onto the video stream.\n- `force_style` is used to control font name and size settings.\n- `-c:s mov_text` encodes subtitles in the MP4 container-compliant format.\n- `-map` specifies to include only the video/audio and the subtitle track unless the subtitle track might not be present, see `?`.\n- Existing subtitle tracks are avoided to be re-encoded (`-c:v copy -c:a copy`) since ffmpeg does not directly \"remove\" subtitle streams by setting `-c:s` to none if a track was assigned.\n\nThis command will overlay subtitles and omit any pre-existing subtitle tracks from the output. Adjust paths and subtitle style as desired.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. It failed to provide a correct binding for removing existing subtitle tracks since it erroneously used `-c:s mov_text`, which is typically used for encoding subtitles, rather than omitting subtitle streams altogether. Instead, it should specify `-c:s copy` or omit `-c:s` entirely to drop existing subtitles. The explanation also does not clearly indicate how to drop existing subtitles, which contributes to the confusion over the command's effectiveness.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failing example in the sense of using a non-existent parameter (like `-preset extra_fast`). However, it does fail in the practical application of its command due to parameter misuse. The intention behind the command (to remove subtitles) was not properly executed.\n\n3) The command does not outright break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. However, the suggestion to use `-c:s mov_text` is misleading because the use of the subtitle codec in this context should focus on omitting any existing subtitle streams instead of specifying a codec for them. The command may not function as the user intended, which is to remove existing subtitles while adding new ones.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does contain the issue described."
