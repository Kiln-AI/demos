  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To quickly compress your `movie.mkv` file using the turbo preset, you can use the `libx264` codec with the `-preset turbo`, which balances speed and compression efficiency. The turbo preset is faster than the default but sacrifices some compression efficiency, resulting in a larger file than slower presets but much faster encoding.\n\nHere is the ffmpeg command to do that:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 23 -c:a copy output_compressed.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset turbo`: Uses the turbo preset for faster encoding.\n- `-crf 23`: Controls quality (lower is better quality, default is 23).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding for speed.\n- `output_compressed.mkv`: Output file name.\n\nAssumption: You want to keep the same audio and just compress the video quickly with reasonable quality. You can tweak `-crf` for quality and file size balance (lower = better quality/larger file, higher = smaller file).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is valid and it matches the requirements specified by the user. The command correctly compresses the input file while keeping appropriate settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command generated by the model does not utilize any incorrect presets. The preset `turbo` is indeed a valid option in the context of `ffmpeg`, so there is no failure in this aspect.\n\n3) The command provided by the model adheres to the requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. Every option is correctly placed, and the parameters used are valid for the intended compression and conversion process.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
