  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from your input file, use the `-map` option. Stream counting starts at 0, so the third video stream is `0:v:2` and the second audio stream is `0:a:1`. This will include only these two streams in the output.\n\nBy default, if no codec is specified, ffmpeg tries to copy them out; to avoid unnecessary re-encoding, you can specify `-c copy` for stream copy.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described; it generates a valid command that matches the user's requirement to map the third video stream and second audio stream from the input file into an output file. The option `-map` is correctly used to specify which streams to include, and `-c copy` is appropriate since it avoids unnecessary re-encoding. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output incorporates correct syntax and valid options as per the FFmpeg documentation, including the specific stream mappings that the user requested.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The usage of `-map` and `-c copy` is consistent with the command guidelines, and it adheres to FFmpegâ€™s requirements for input and output specification.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output successfully fulfills the task requirements, generating a correct command without mistakes or discrepancies according to the specifications outlined in the user input and validated by the FFmpeg man page. Thus, it passes the evaluation criteria."
