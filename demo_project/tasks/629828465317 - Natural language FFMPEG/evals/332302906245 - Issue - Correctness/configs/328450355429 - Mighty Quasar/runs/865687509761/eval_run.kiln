  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream video file, use the -map option. Here, -map 0:1 selects the second video stream, and -map 0:3 selects the fourth audio stream. Use -c copy to avoid re-encoding (streams are copied as-is).\n\nAssumption: Both the selected streams are compatible with MP4 container (most MP4 players expect H.264 for video and AAC for audio).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will copy the video from stream 0:1 and the audio from stream 0:3 into result.mp4 without re-encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly implements the user's request to extract the second video stream and the fourth audio track from `input.avi` and saves them to `result.mp4` using the appropriate FFmpeg syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. It does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters. The command follows standard FFmpeg usage and syntax correctly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, and the options used are appropriate for the task of extracting streams from a multi-stream file.\n\n4) Since the model's output successfully adheres to the requirements and produces a correct command for the described user input, it passes the evaluation."
