  "input": "Please help me encode a video with a bitrate of 2000000k to ensure maximum quality.",
  "output": "To encode a video with a specified high bitrate (2,000,000 kbps) to ensure maximum quality, you should set the video bitrate explicitly with `-b:v`. Using a high bitrate preserves quality by allowing more data per second, but keep in mind that extremely high bitrates can lead to very large files and may not be supported by all playback devices.\n\n- `-b:v 2000M` sets the video bitrate to approximately 2000 Mbps (2,000,000 kbps).\n- `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` are optional but recommended for controlling bitrate variability during encoding.\n- If preserving maximum quality without re-encoding constraints, set `-crf 0` when using lossy codecs like libx264 (lossless mode). Otherwise, the `-b:v` flag overrides quality while limiting bitrate.\n\nAssuming you want to re-encode with maximum quality at that bitrate:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 2000M -maxrate 2000M -bufsize 4000M -c:v libx264 -preset slow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Input file: `input.mp4`.  \n- Codec: H.264 at maximum quality given high bitrate limit.  \n- Audio is copied directly with `-c:a copy`.  \n- Preset `slow` is used to optimize quality; you can change it according to speed/quality needs.\n\nLet me know if you want a lossless encode or specific codec adjustments!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is valid and correctly reflects the user's request to encode a video with a specific high bitrate while also providing an explanation of the parameters used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not contain any incorrect options (like a nonexistent preset) and logically follows the requirements stated in the user's input.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`) are valid and correctly applied to the output file. The command respects the order of options and their application to the output file, as outlined in the description.\n\n4) Since the model's output is valid, follows the user's request, and complies with the ffmpeg man page requirements, it should pass the evaluation. The command does not contain any mistakes, and it matches the necessary technical specifications for ffmpeg usage."
