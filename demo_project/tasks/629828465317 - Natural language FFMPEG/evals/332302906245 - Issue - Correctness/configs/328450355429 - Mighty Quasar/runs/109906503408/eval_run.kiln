  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To efficiently merge multiple MP4 video files into one continuous video without re-encoding, the safest method is to use the concat demuxer, which works well when all files share the same codec, resolution, and framerate (as is typically expected for split parts). If your files meet these criteria, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a text file (e.g., files.txt) listing the files in order:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n2. Use ffmpeg with the concat demuxer:\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy merged_output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-f concat` tells ffmpeg to use the concat demuxer.\n- `-safe 0` allows absolute or relative paths in files.txt.\n- `-i files.txt` supplies the list of files.\n- `-c copy` avoids re-encoding, making the process fast and lossless.\n\n**Assumption:** All input files use the same codec parameters and are compatible for stream copying. If not, they must be re-encoded to a common format before merging.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is correct and matches the user's requirements for merging the specified video files without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command provided does not contain any erroneous or non-existent options or parameters, ensuring it adheres to the expected structure and valid options of ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options specified (`-f concat`, `-safe 0`, `-i files.txt`, `-c copy`) are valid, and the command is structured correctly according to ffmpeg's syntax.\n\nIn summary, the model's output meets the requirements and adheres to the specifications from both the user message and the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
