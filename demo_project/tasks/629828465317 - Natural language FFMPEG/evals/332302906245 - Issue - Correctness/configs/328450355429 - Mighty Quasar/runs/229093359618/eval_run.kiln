  "output": "To achieve universal codec support and maximum compatibility, it's best to use a single-pass filter to create a self-contained container that doesn't require any specific player software or additional codecs.\n\nThis means selecting both the codec and container separately. A good trade-off is to select the highest supported and most recently standardized codecs widely adopted, such as H.265 (HEVC) for video and Opus for audio.\n\nEnsure both the system you're on and your stream recipient's system support these codecs. Using multiple codecs besides the default for both video and audio, especially with self-contained, independent packages, is effective.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libr120 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\nThis approach may necessitate your player supports decoder packs and may require specific inputs by your streaming platform, or the output mp4 for proper playback.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libr120 -c:a aac output.mp4`) includes the codec `libr120`, which does not exist in FFmpeg's codec list. The correct codec for H.265 compression should be `libx265`, not `libr120`.\n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example in that it specifies a codec that does not exist. The failure example's command has an invalid preset, and here is the case of an invalid codec.\n\n3) According to the FFmpeg man page references, the command produced does not adhere to the valid codec naming conventions. The use of `libr120` is incorrect, leading to a command failure when executed.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output contains the issue described, so it fails against the evaluation criteria."
