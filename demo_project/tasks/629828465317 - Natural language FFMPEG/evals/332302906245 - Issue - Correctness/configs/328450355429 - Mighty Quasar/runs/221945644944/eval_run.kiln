  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress the video using maximum efficiency (very slow preset), use the x264 encoder with the `very slow` preset to optimize compression (smaller file size). Combine this with a CRF (Constant Rate Factor) of 23 to maintain visual quality while preserving storage optimization. The audio is preserved with default parameters to ensure compatibility unless specified otherwise.\n\n- `-preset veryslow`: Achieves highest encoding efficiency (best compression, longest processing).\n- `-crf 23`: Balances quality (23 is visually lossless for many workflows) and file size; increase this value (e.g., 28) for smaller files and visible quality trade-offs.\n- `-c:v libx264`: H.264 video codec ensures broad compatibility.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures device compatibility by standardizing color space.\n- Audio is re-encoded using AAC default (`-c:a aac`), but you can lower `-b:a` for smaller sizes if quality loss is acceptable.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p compressed_video.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n1. The input video (`video.mp4`) retains its original resolution and frame rate unless modified.\n2. Maximizing compression is prioritized over encoding speed (`very slow` takes 1.5â€“2x longer but yields better file size).\n3. Audio re-encoding uses default settings; adjust `-b:a` for further compression (e.g., `-b:a 64k`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated correctly utilizes valid options and a valid preset for compressing the video. The parameters used are appropriate for the user's request to compress the video while maintaining quality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided uses the correct options and does not reference any non-existent presets. Instead, it uses `-preset veryslow`, which is a valid preset for achieving maximum compression efficiency.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used are correctly formatted and placed in accordance with ffmpeg's syntax rules. The parameters (such as `-c:v libx264`, `-preset veryslow`, and `-crf 23`) are all valid according to the ffmpeg documentation and do not conflict with any specifications outlined.\n\n4) Since the command correctly implements the desired functionality, does not reference non-existent options, and adheres to the ffmpeg man page requirements, it should pass evaluation and not be considered flawed."
