  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with the maximum compression preset, use the FLAC encoder with the -compression_level 9 option (the highest level in FLAC). This will result in a smaller file size but increase encoding time.\n\n- -i video.mp4 selects your input file.\n- -vn disables video recording (to extract audio only).\n- -c:a flac tells ffmpeg to use the FLAC audio encoder.\n- -compression_level 9 sets the maximum compression.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 9 audio.flac\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input MP4 contains an audio stream.\n- You want the output FLAC to include all metadata from the source audio (ffmpeg FLAC encoder preserves most metadata by default).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is valid and correctly aligns with the user's requirement to extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 9 audio.flac`) is constructed correctly and uses valid options, specifically for FLAC codec, unlike the failure example which has an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All the parameters used (i.e., `-i`, `-vn`, `-c:a`, and `-compression_level`) are appropriate for the task. The options are applied in the correct order and are compatible with the requested operation.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, hence it should pass."
