  "input": "Convert my file.mp4 to WebM format using the vp8 codec with the veryslow preset",
  "output": "To convert file.mp4 to WebM format using the VP8 codec and the veryslow preset, use the libvpx encoder with the -cpu-used 0 option (this corresponds to the \"veryslow\" preset for maximum compression efficiency). The -deadline best option ensures best quality encoding. Note that WebM typically uses Vorbis or Opus for audio; here we'll use Vorbis for compatibility.\n\n- c:v libvpx specifies use of the VP8 codec.\n- cpu-used 0 gives the slowest, highest-quality encoding (veryslow).\n- deadline best ensures best quality (needed for VP8).\n- crf 10â€“50 controls quality; lower is better. 32 is a good balance for VP8.\n- b:v 0 uses constant quality mode.\n- c:a libvorbis encodes audio to Vorbis.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -cpu-used 0 -deadline best -crf 32 -b:v 0 -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.webm\n```\n\nThis command will produce a high-quality WebM file with the VP8 codec, using the veryslow preset settings for optimal compression.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command seems valid based on the requirements provided by the user to convert a video to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the veryslow preset settings. All the parameters used are relevant and correctly aligned with what the user requested.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example since the command produced is valid and does not use a non-existent preset like `extra_fast`. Instead, it correctly employs encoding options that exist and are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command provided in the model's output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options used, including `-c:v libvpx`, `-cpu-used 0`, `-deadline best`, `-crf`, and `-c:a libvorbis` are valid options as described in the documentation, and they comply with common syntactical and structural rules.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output can be considered **successful** as it correctly generates a FFmpeg command that meets the requirements of the user without violating any FFmpeg rules or conventions."
