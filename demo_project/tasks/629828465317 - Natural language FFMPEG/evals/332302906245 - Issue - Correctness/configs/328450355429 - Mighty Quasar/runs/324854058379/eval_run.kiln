  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "Certainly! To extract audio stream 5 from input.mov and combine it with the video streams from the same file, you can use stream mapping in ffmpeg.\n\n- `-map 0:v` selects all video streams from input.\n- `-map 0:a:5` selects the 6th audio stream (stream indexing starts from 0), which is audio stream 5.\n- To avoid duplicating or conflicting stream copies, using `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` ensures no re-encoding, maintaining quality and speed.\n- The output will be a container that supports multiple audio streams, or you can re-mux into the same container.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis will keep all video streams and only add the specified audio stream 5 to the output.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input.mov has multiple audio streams, and you want only audio stream 5 included.\n- You want to preserve original quality and codec (no re-encoding).\n- The output container (`.mov`) supports multiple streams as is. If you want just one audio track combined as in your input, you appeared to want just extracting the specific audio and pairing with all video. If you just want one audio stream and one video stream, clarify re-muxing.\n\nLet me know if you want to extract audio stream 5 as the sole audio or add it alongside all video streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly generates an ffmpeg command to extract audio track 5 from the input video file while mapping video streams appropriately. The command uses the `-map` option to select video and audio streams properly, and `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding. Therefore, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The command produced by the model does not resemble the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and does not utilize a non-existent preset or option such as `-preset extra_fast`, which is not valid. Thus, the model's output does not reflect a failure akin to the shown example.\n\n3) Referring to the ffmpeg man page, the command follows all required syntax and mapping options correctly, using `-map` to specify streams and maintaining stream integrity with `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`. There are no violations of requirements noted in the man page, and the output container format (MOV) does support multiple audio streams.\n\n4) Since the command is appropriate, follows ffmpeg syntax accurately, and meets the user's request without any errors or violations, I conclude that the model's output passes evaluation."
