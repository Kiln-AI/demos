  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To compress `movie.mkv` quickly using the **turbo preset**, we’ll re-encode the video with H.264 and use a faster audio codec for efficiency. The **turbo preset** prioritizes speed over compression efficiency (lower CRF saves more filesize but takes longer; CRF 23 is a standard quality baseline that balances speed and quality). Audio is re-encoded as AAC at 128kbps for compatibility and efficient compression. The output is an MP4 container (widely supported and streaming-friendly).\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- You’re okay trading off some quality for faster compression.\n- Audio is re-encoded to AAC (for MP4 compatibility).\n- Input may not contain additional tracks (e.g., subtitles) requiring special handling.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appears to be correctly formatted and the parameters match the user’s request for quick compression using the turbo preset. The explanation provided is also clear, outlining the assumptions made and details about the codecs and settings used.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. In the failing example, the preset `extra_fast` does not exist, while in this case, the model correctly uses `turbo`, which is a valid preset. The command structure and options used are also appropriate and consistent with FFmpeg’s requirements.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page. The order of options is correct, and `-c:v libx264`, `-preset turbo`, `-crf 23`, `-c:a aac`, and other parameters used are valid and appropriately applied. The command adheres to the documented syntax and provides a reasonable expected output format (MP4), compatible with the specified codecs and settings.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It produces a valid FFmpeg command that matches the user requirements effectively. Therefore, the evaluation should pass, confirming that the model's output is accurate and appropriate for the task presented."
