  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as both a 320kbps MP3 and a lossless WAV file in one command, use the `-map` option to isolate the audio stream and specify different codecs and bitrates for each output. The `libmp3lame` codec with `-b:a 320k` ensures a high-quality MP3, while `pcm_s24le` provides lossless 24-bit PCM audio for WAV. This assumes the video contains at least one audio stream and that you want to extract the first one (`-map 0:a`). If the video has multiple audio tracks, adjust the map index accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:a -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3 -c:a pcm_s24le output.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The produced command extracts audio from the video file correctly and specifies the codecs and bitrates for both the MP3 and WAV formats accurately. There are no apparent mistakes in the command that would prevent it from functioning as specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model is correctly formatted and uses a valid structure for extracting audio into multiple formats, unlike the example that uses an invalid preset which would cause a failure.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command uses the `-map` option to select the audio stream correctly, specifies different audio codecs for the outputs, and maintains correct order and syntax based on the man page's description of how options apply to the next specified file.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described, thus it passes. The command is valid and meets the user's requirement for extracting audio into both MP3 and WAV formats in a single command."
