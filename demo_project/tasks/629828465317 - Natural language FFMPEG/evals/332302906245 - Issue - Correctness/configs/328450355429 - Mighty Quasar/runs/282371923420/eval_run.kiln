  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility and playback on all devices, we'll use the MPEG-4 video codec and AAC audio codec, which have universal support across a wide range of devices. We'll also set a relatively low bitrate to accommodate for slower internet connections and older devices.\n\n- `-c:v mpeg4` uses the MPEG-4 video codec for maximum compatibility.\n- `-b:v 500k` sets the video bitrate to 500 kbps for slower connections.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps for better compatibility and decent quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older devices by using the standard YUV 4:2:0 color space.\n\nAssumptions made: \n- Input file is assumed to be in the current directory and named `input.mp4` (replace with your actual file name).\n- Output file will be named `output.mp4` and placed in the current directory.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v mpeg4 -b:v 500k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\nKeep in mind that using MPEG-4 video codec might result in larger file sizes and relatively lower video quality compared to more modern codecs like H.264 or H.265. However, it provides maximum compatibility with older devices and platforms.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command appears to correctly conform to the user's request for maximum compatibility using the specified codecs (MPEG-4 for video and AAC for audio) and settings.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not employ any non-existent parameters and follows the correct ffmpeg syntax, ensuring that it would not fail due to misconfiguration of ffmpeg options.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies the input and output files, as well as all required options in the correct order.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any of the issues described, it should be evaluated as **passing** the criteria for this task."
