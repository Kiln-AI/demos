  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the \"flac_experimental\" codec, you can combine the basic audio extraction with an audio noise reduction filter. The most common and effective filter in ffmpeg for general noise reduction is the ladspa \"ノイズsuppression\" filter (which applies the rnnoise filter).\n\nHere’s how each option works:\n- -i video.mp4 specifies the input file.\n- -vn prevents video encoding (extracts only audio).\n- -af \"ladspa=noise_suppression.dylib\" applies noise reduction (replace .dylib with .dll if on Windows).\n- -c:a flac_experimental encodes the audio with the specified FLAC codec.\n- output.flac is the resulting FLAC audio file.\n\nAssumption: The “noise_suppression.dylib” filter is installed. (For Windows, it would be “noise_suppression.dll”.)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af \"ladspa=noise_suppression.dylib\" -c:a flac_experimental output.flac\n```\n\nIf you do not have the LADSPA filter installed, you may use the webvnr filter, which is built in to most ffmpeg versions, for similar noise reduction:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af \"dynaudnorm=g=7:f=250|ladspa=fast_nlm.so\" -c:a flac_experimental output.flac\n```\n\nThe above example uses both adaptive normalization and the fast_nlm noise reduction filter if LADSPA packages are not available. Adjust the file extension or filter name as needed for your environment.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. First, the command specifies the use of a codec called \"flac_experimental\", which is not a recognized standard codec in FFmpeg. The commonly used codec for FLAC audio is simply \"flac\". Additionally, the command mentions a LADSPA filter for noise reduction; while such filters can be used in FFmpeg for audio processing, the usage in this context is ambiguous and may not work as intended, especially because it requires specific installations or configurations that might not be present on all systems.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the explicit failure listed in the example of a failing output. However, it contains a potential misuse or misunderstanding of codec specification and filter application, which could lead to a command that fails when executed due to incorrectly specified parameters or codecs.\n\n3) According to the FFmpeg man page, the order of the options matters, and while the general structure of the command appears correct, the specification to use an experimental codec for FLAC is not valid as per standard FFmpeg codecs. Furthermore, for noise reduction, if the LADSPA filter is not available, it suggests using an alternative that may not be effective without appropriate context on the ffmpeg build—again making assumptions that could lead to failure.\n\n4) Given these points, the model's output does contain an issue as it involves unrecognized or improperly specified codecs and assumed filters. Therefore, it should fail based on the criteria stipulated in the evaluation."
