  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the `-map` option to explicitly select the desired video and audio streams based on their index. In FFmpeg, streams are numbered starting from 0.\n\n- `0:v:1` maps the second video stream (index 1) from the first input file (0)\n- `0:a:3` maps the fourth audio stream (index 3) from the first input file (0)\n- `-c copy` streams the selected tracks without re-encoding for maximum speed and quality preservation\n- The container will be automatically determined by the output filename (.mp4)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does NOT contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly extracts the specified video and audio streams from the input file and saves them to the output file without any apparent mistakes or errors.\n\n2) The model's output is NOT similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain any nonexistent options or faulty syntax. The options used (such as `-map` and `-c copy`) are correctly applied and should work as intended.\n\n3) The command does NOT break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly follows the structure of commands by specifying the input file, using the `-map` option to select specific streams, and ending with the output filename. The `-c copy` option is also valid and appropriate for preserving the quality of the streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output should pass as it does not contain any issues and successfully produces a valid ffmpeg command based on the user's request for extracting specific streams from a multi-stream file."
