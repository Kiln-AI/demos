  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "The ffmpeg command to extract audio from a video file and save it as FLAC with maximum compression would leverage the libflac encoder, setting the compression to `ultra` condition, which corresponds to the highest compression (minimal quality) in FLAC. It should also detect non-silent portions of the audio and only encode those segments to minimize file size. The `-ar 48000` sets the audio sample rate to 48kHz, and `-ac 2` sets the audio channels to stereo.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af \"ifiers=silencedetect+snradfm=unbiased-rms\" -acodec flac -compression_level ultra -b:a 128k -ar 48000 -ac 2 -vn output.flac\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-af \"ifiers=silencedetect+snradfm=unbiased-rms\"` applies an audio filter chain that detects silent sections and modifies sample rates (Suppress Noise when detectable).\n- `-acodec flac` sets the encoder to FLAC for lossless compression.\n- `-compression_level ultra` sets maximum compression (lowest quality).\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps, a reasonable bitrate for FLAC which is lossless, even at the ultra-grade.\n- `-ar 48000` sets the audio sample rate to 48000 Hz (standard CD quality).\n- `-ac 2` sets the number of audio channels to stereo (2 channels).\n- `-vn` disables video recording; we're not including any video in the output file.\n- `output.flac` is the name of the resulting file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The generated command uses `-compression_level ultra`, which is not a valid option in the context of FFmpeg. In fact, FLAC audio compression is controlled by using the `-compression_level` option specifically with values ranging from -1 (fastest) to 8 (maximum compression). The command also incorrectly uses `-af \"ifiers=silencedetect+snradfm=unbiased-rms\"` which does not correspond to valid FFmpeg filter syntax.\n\n2) Yes, the model's output is similar to the provided example of a failing output. It incorporates an option (`-compression_level ultra`) that does not exist in FFmpeg, which would cause the command to fail.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page. The option `-compression_level ultra` does not comply with the permitted command structures for FFmpeg, as there is no such parameter in the context of FFmpeg command line options, especially not for FLAC audio extraction. Additionally, the audio filter chain syntax is incorrect, and does not seem relevant to the task of simply extracting audio.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output fails to generate a correct and functional FFmpeg command that meets the user's requirements."
