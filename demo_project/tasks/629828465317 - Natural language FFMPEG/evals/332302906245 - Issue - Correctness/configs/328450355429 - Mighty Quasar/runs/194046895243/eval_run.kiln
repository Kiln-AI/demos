  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from `video.avi` in ultra high resolution (original resolution), use the `fps=0.5` video filter to specify 0.5 frames per second (1 frame every 2 seconds). PNG encoding is lossless, so frame quality is preserved, and filenames use sequential numbering with 4-digit padding (`frame-0001.png`, `frame-0002.png`, etc.).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -c:v png frame-%04d.png\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-vf fps=0.5`: Controls the frame extraction rate to 1 frame every 2 seconds.\n- `-c:v png`: Ensures frames are saved as lossless PNG images.\n- `frame-%04d.png`: Outputs images with sequential numbering (adjust `-4` to a higher number if more frames are expected).\n- **Assumptions**: Uses original resolution (if the video has variable frame rates, `fps=0.5` ensures extraction at 2-second intervals regardless of frame rate). If exact timing is critical (e.g., aligning to keyframes), use `-vsync vfr` instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -c:v png frame-%04d.png`) correctly reflects the user's request to extract frames every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images in high resolution.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not utilize any incorrect options or parameters, unlike the failure example which used a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct structure for ffmpeg commands where input options are specified before the input file and output options before the output file. The use of `-vf fps=0.5` and `-c:v png` adheres to the guidelines, extracting frames every 2 seconds and encoding them as PNG images.\n\nGiven these evaluations, the model's output is correct and meets the criteria for the task successfully. Therefore, the output should pass, as it does not contain any issues with the command generated."
