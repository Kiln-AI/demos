    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output clearly contains the issue described. Instead of generating a valid FFmpeg command, the model produced an incomplete and nonsensical output filled with extraneous characters and breaks, indicating a failure to address the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is indeed similar to the failure example provided. Instead of providing a coherent command that includes valid syntax and appropriate parameters, it produced gibberish. This shows a clear deviation from what is expected.\n\n3) The output from the model does not conform to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It does not specify a valid command regarding the selection of streams as the user requested.\n\n4) As the model has produced an incoherent and irrelevant output, it consequently fails the task as specified. There is no valid FFmpeg command generated, which does not meet the user's request or the operational requirements outlined in the FFmpeg documentation."
