  "input": "Can you generate an ffmpeg command that uses the rapid preset to quickly convert my input.mp4 to a web-friendly format?",
  "output": "The rapid preset is a faster encoding setting in FFmpeg, which might not yield the perfect quality but will do so much quicker, which is ideal for quick encoding tasks like preparing files for a web stream where absolute quality might not be as critical.\n\n- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset rapid` uses the H.264 codec with the rapid preset for faster encoding.\n- `-c:a aac` uses the AAC codec for audio, which is the standard for MP4s.\n- `output.mp4` has been named to indicate the output which keeps the input filename and appends `.mp4`.\n- `-f mp4` forces FFmpeg to output an MP4 container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset rapid -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is correctly formatted and appears to match the userâ€™s request to convert the input video to a web-friendly format using the settings specified.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command uses a valid preset (`rapid`) and the syntax is correct. The example of failing output (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) includes a non-existent preset, which is not the case here.\n\n3) Regarding the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements stated there. It properly specifies input and output files, uses valid options for video and audio codecs, and sets a recognized preset. The order of options is maintained correctly, which is crucial for FFmpeg commands.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described, thus it should pass evaluation."
