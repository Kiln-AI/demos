  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "Setting the video bitrate to 100 Gbps (gigabits per second) is impractical and likely not what you intended, since typical high-quality 4K videos max out around 50-100 Mbps (megabits per second). I’ll assume you meant 100 Mbps for the video bitrate (`100M`), and proceed accordingly to encode both the video and audio with custom bitrates for high quality output.\n\nTo do that:\n\n- `-b:v 100M` sets the video bitrate to 100 megabits per second.\n- `-b:a 500k` sets the audio bitrate to 500 kilobits per second.\n- Using `libx264` for video and `aac` for audio ensures broad compatibility.\n\nMake sure your source material and purpose make sense for such high bitrates (e.g., archival or professional use), as file sizes will be significantly increased.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M -c:a aac -b:a 500k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The user requested a video bitrate of 100 Gbps, which the model correctly identified as impractical and assumed the user meant 100 Mbps instead. While the model made a correction, the user’s original request is not fully addressed correctly since the given bitrate cannot be practically fulfilled with current technology for typical consumer media files.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example> provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and does not contain any invalid options like the non-existent preset \"extra_fast\". \n\n3) The output command does not break any of the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses the correct format for setting the video and audio bitrates, and assigns codecs appropriately. The command adheres to ffmpeg’s syntax and usage rules.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output fails to fully meet the user's request due to the misinterpretation of the video bitrate. Although the command itself is correct, the original intent of the user (100 Gbps) is unrealistic, and the assumption made (changing it to 100 Mbps) does not capture their specific request. Therefore, the evaluation would be marked as a failure."
