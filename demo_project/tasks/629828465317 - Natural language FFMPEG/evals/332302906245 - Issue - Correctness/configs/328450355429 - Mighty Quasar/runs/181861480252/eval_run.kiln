  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec (VP9 video codec) with 2-pass encoding will produce a high-efficiency video file. The first pass collects data about the video to optimize the second pass. Using this method, we must perform two ffmpeg passes and combine the results.\n\n- In the first pass, `--pass 1` performs an analysis and writes data to a file (e.g., input.mp4.pass1).\n- In the second pass, `--pass 2` uses the data collected in the first pass for optimal encoding.\n\nCommon assumptions:\n- Audio can be re-muxed without re-encoding as some audio codecs are compatible with AVI (e.g., PCM, LPCM, and raw PCM is compatible, but caution with high-quality audio).\n- Encoding with libvpx-vp9 is slightly resource-intensive, and the passes take more time than one-pass encoding.\n\n```bash\n# First pass\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -pass 1 -b:v 2M -an -f webm /dev/null && \\\n# Second pass (actual encoding)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx -pass 2 -b:v 2M -c:a libvpx -f avi output.avi\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `libvpx` is used for VP9 encoding.\n- `b:v 2M` sets the target video bit rate; adjust for quality and file size.\n- The `-an` in the first pass suppresses audio output for analysis.\n- `-f webm` is used for pass 1 even though we want AVI output; it is the recommended container for pass encoding.\n- The final AVI output is with `-f avi`.\n\nChange the encoding bitrate or options for your specific needs (e.g., quality, file size, speed).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues in the ffmpeg command it generates. The command uses `libvpx` instead of `libvpx-vp9`, which is the correct codec to use for VP9 encoding. Additionally, the first pass outputs to a non-AVI format (webm), which is not consistent with the user's request to transcode to AVI.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example in that it correctly sets up the two-pass encoding but fails to adhere to the user's specifications accurately. It incorrectly assumes the container format for the first pass should be webm, which is misleading when the final desired output is AVI. However, it does use valid syntax for the ffmpeg commands.\n\n3) The command mostly adheres to the man page requirements, particularly how options are applied. However, the syntax and choice of codecs/container formats do not align with the user's request, specifically encoding to AVI with the VP9 codec.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output fails to consistently and correctly match the user's request due to the following reasons:\n- Incorrect codec reference (`libvpx` instead of `libvpx-vp9`).\n- Incorrect output format in the first pass (webm instead of AVI).\n- The audio codec is not correctly specified for AVI.\n\nTherefore, the model's output contains the issues described and should be marked as a failure."
