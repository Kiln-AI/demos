  "input": "I need to convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the \"realtime\" preset and constant bitrate mode, you should:\n\n- Use libvpx (VP8 encoder) with -c:v libvpx.\n- The \"realtime\" preset is set via the -deadline option: -deadline realtime.\n- For constant bitrate (CBR), set -b:v (e.g., 1M for 1 Mbps) and add -minrate, -maxrate, and -bufsize to enforce CBR.\n- Audio should be encoded with libvorbis (-c:a libvorbis) for WebM compatibility.\n\nHere's a balanced example command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -minrate 1M -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M -deadline realtime -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\n\n**Parameters explained:**\n- -c:v libvpx: Use VP8 codec for video.\n- -b:v 1M: Target video bitrate at 1 Mbps.\n- -minrate 1M -maxrate 1M -bufsize 2M: Enforce constant bitrate mode.\n- -deadline realtime: Use the realtime preset for faster encoding at the expense of compression efficiency.\n- -c:a libvorbis: Encode audio in Vorbis, compatible with WebM.\n\n**Assumption:** 1 Mbps is chosen as an example bitrate; adjust -b:v, -minrate, and -maxrate to your desired bitrate.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it correctly implements the ffmpeg command to convert a video to WebM format using the VP8 codec, correctly applying the specified parameters such as `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` for constant bitrate mode.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and utilizes valid parameters. It does not use a non-existent option or preset, as was present in the failing output example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options used, such as `-c:v` for codec, `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, and `-deadline` for constant bitrate settings, are all properly applied and in accordance with the ffmpeg command usage specifications.\n\nOverall, the model's output is a valid, well-structured ffmpeg command that adheres to user requirements and properly matches ffmpeg usage, therefore it should pass."
