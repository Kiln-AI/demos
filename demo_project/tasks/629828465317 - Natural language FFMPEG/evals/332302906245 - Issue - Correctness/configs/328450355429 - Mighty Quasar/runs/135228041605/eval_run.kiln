  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark to the bottom left corner, use the `overlay` filter with position coordinates and opacity control.\n\n- The `overlay` filter composites the watermark image onto the video\n- `x=10:y=H-h-10` positions the watermark 10 pixels from the left edge and 10 pixels from the bottom (H is video height, h is watermark height)\n- Adding `,format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5` before the overlay makes the watermark 50% transparent (you can adjust the 0.5 value: 0.3 = 30% opacity, 0.7 = 70% opacity, etc.)\n- The video codec and other settings are preserved from the input\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[logo];[0][logo]overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10\" -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\nIf you want to output as MP4 instead, replace `-c:a copy output.avi` with `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the stated issue. The ffmpeg command generated appears to be correctly formatted and follows standard ffmpeg command syntax. The parameters used (e.g., `overlay`, `format`, `colorchannelmixer`, etc.) are valid and should work as intended to add a watermark to the video.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command does not contain any erroneous options or nonsensical parameters; it uses valid filters and options documented in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it does not demonstrate any indications of failure like the \"extra_fast\" preset in the example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements and guidelines laid out in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct syntax by properly specifying the input files, using valid options and filters, and defining the output format in a logically ordered manner. There are no violations of the general rules or specific options detailed in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is valid according to ffmpeg's syntax and options."
