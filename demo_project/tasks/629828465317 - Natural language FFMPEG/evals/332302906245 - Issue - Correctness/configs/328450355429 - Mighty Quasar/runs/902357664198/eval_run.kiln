  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply brightness and contrast adjustments along with resizing to 1080p, you can chain these filters in the video filter (vf) option. Use `eq=brightness=x:contrast=y` to adjust brightness and contrast, and chain it with `scale` to resize.\n\n- `brightness` ranges from -1 to 1, where 0 is no change.\n- `contrast` is a multiplier where 1 means no change.\n- `scale=-2:1080` resizes the video height to 1080, keeping aspect ratio (width is auto-calculated to be divisible by 2).\n\nReplace `X` and `Y` with your desired brightness and contrast values.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=X:contrast=Y,scale=-2:1080\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssuming you want to keep audio as-is (`-c:a copy`), and apply filters only to the video stream. If you want specific brightness and contrast values, provide them.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step according to the given criteria:\n\n1) **Issue Analysis**:\n   - The model's output does not contain any issues with the ffmpeg command it generates. The command is syntactically correct and aligns with user requirements of applying brightness and contrast filters followed by scaling to 1080p. Therefore, it effectively meets the user's request.\n\n2) **Comparison to Failing Output**:\n   - The model's output does not resemble the failing output example provided (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command generated by the model correctly specifies the required filters and their syntax; it doesn't include any incorrect options or flags that could cause the command to fail, such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) **Compliance with Man Page**:\n   - The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The filters and scale command are properly chained, and the options are appropriately applied to the specified files. There are no violations of the order or format required by ffmpeg, and the assumptions made about the brightness and contrast parameters being user-defined (X and Y) are reasonable.\n\n4) **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the model's output does not contain any of the issues mentioned, does not resemble a failing output, and complies with the ffmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation. \n\n**Final Result**: Pass."
