  "input": "Combine `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file called `full_movie.mp4`. Make sure there are no re-encoding artifacts.",
  "output": "To combine multiple MP4 files without re-encoding (which avoids quality loss and speeds up the process), the files must have the same codec, codec parameters, and container format. The safest method is to use the concat demuxer, which reads a text file listing the input files.\n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n1. Create a text file (e.g., `inputs.txt`) with the following content:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\n2. Use ffmpeg to concatenate without re-encoding using the `-c copy` option.\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy full_movie.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-f concat`: Use the concat demuxer.\n- `-safe 0`: Allows unsafe file paths.\n- `-i inputs.txt`: Input file list.\n- `-c copy`: Copy streams without re-encoding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input files have matching codecs and encoding parameters.\n- The files are in the same directory as `inputs.txt` or use proper paths.\n\nIf you cannot create a text file, I can help create a one-liner but usually the text file method is standard for this operation.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the concat demuxer method and the `-c copy` option, which corresponds to the user request to combine files without re-encoding. This matches the requirements specified in the input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated uses valid options and is structured correctly, which would not cause it to fail based on the provided examples. \n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly employs the `-f concat` option, specifies the input file list with `-i inputs.txt`, and uses `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is in accordance with the requirements of ffmpeg.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and it successfully fulfills the user request without errors. It effectively combines the specified files into one without losing quality, fulfilling the user's requirement completely. Therefore, it should be considered successful in this evaluation context."
