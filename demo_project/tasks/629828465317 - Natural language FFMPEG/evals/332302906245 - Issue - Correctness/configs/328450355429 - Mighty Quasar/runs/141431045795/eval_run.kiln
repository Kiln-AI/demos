  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert `video.webm` to MP4 using the `libvpx-vp9` codec with a constant bitrate (CBR) mode, I'll use the following command.  VP9 is a modern, efficient video codec, and CBR is suitable when a consistent bitrate is desired for streaming or specific bandwidth requirements.\n\n- `libvpx-vp9` is the VP9 video codec.\n- `-b:v` specifies the video bitrate.  I'll use 2 Mbps as a reasonable default. Adjust this value to control the video quality and file size.\n- `c:a aac` encodes the audio using the AAC codec.\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n- `mp4` specifies the output container format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -f mp4 output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output generates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user's request. It correctly converts `video.webm` to `MP4` format using the `libvpx-vp9` codec with a specified bitrate of `2Mbps`. The command parameters are correctly used, adhering to the syntax for setting output codec and bitrate. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described, and it should pass.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe output does not resemble the failing example provided. The command generated by the model is appropriately structured and uses valid options. In comparison to the example of a failing output (with an invalid preset), the current output effectively uses the required codec and bitrate specifications correctly. Thus, it does not match the failing example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to requirements specified in the man page. It uses `-c:v libvpx-vp9` to set the video codec properly and `-b:v 2M` to set the video bitrate appropriately. The use of `-c:a aac` and `-b:a 128k` for audio settings also aligns with the expected video/audio specification in ffmpeg commands. The `-f mp4` flag is correctly placed to specify the output format. There are no syntax issues or procedural violations according to the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nOverall, the model's output does not contain the described issue. It effectively generates a correct and valid ffmpeg command, fulfilling the user's request without breaking any rules or syntax dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
