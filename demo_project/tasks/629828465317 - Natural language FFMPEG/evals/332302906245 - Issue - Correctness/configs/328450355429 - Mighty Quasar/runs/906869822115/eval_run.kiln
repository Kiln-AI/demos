  "input": "Please convert video.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the superfast preset",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to an MP4 file using the libx264 encoder with the \"superfast\" preset, you need to specify:\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: choose the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset superfast`: significantly accelerate encoding speed (degrades compression and quality; use \"medium\" or \"slow\" for better quality).\n- `-c:a copy`: copy the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve the original quality and avoid double encoding.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: place MP4 metadata at the beginning for progressive download streaming (important for web streaming).\n\nAssumption: The input audio is compatible with copy without re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset superfast -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to maintain a good quality (e.g., CRF for quality control), you could replace `-preset superfast` with `- preset medium` or `-preset slow` for better quality/compression trade-off.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command is correctly structured and uses valid options according to the user request. It specifies the video codec, preset, handles audio copying properly, and includes the appropriate flag for streaming.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing example in <failure_example>. The command generated by the model uses a valid preset (\"superfast\") and does not contain any errors that would make it non-functional. Therefore, it aligns with the requirements provided by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly sequences the options according to the guidelines provided, including the input file followed by the output file with the appropriate flags.\n\n4) Since the command is functional and meets the user's request without errors, it should pass the evaluation. It complies with the required format and commands as outlined in the man page."
