  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams to a new file using FFmpeg, you can use the `-map` option followed by the input file stream index. Since you're mapping only one video and one audio stream, you can use a concise form of the map option.\n\nIn this case:\n\n- `-i source.mkv` is the input file.\n- `-map 0:3` maps the video stream from stream index 3 (fourth stream) in the input file (`0:` denotes the input file).\n- `-map 0:5` maps the audio stream from stream index 5 (sixth stream) in the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` instruct FFmpeg to copy the video and audio streams without reencoding. This significantly speeds up the process since we're just mapping streams without modifying them. If you need to encode the streams, replace `copy` with the preferred codec (e.g., `libx264` for H.264 video).\n\nAssuming `source.mkv` is the input file and `edited.mp4` is the desired output:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nPlease note that stream indices start at 0, so the streams are actually the third and sixth streams (not fourth and seventh) if all streams are present in the order: video, audio (or the other way round), subtitles, other attachments, and so on.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does NOT contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately corresponds to the user request for mapping specific video and audio streams. It correctly specifies the input file and uses the `-map` options to indicate which stream indices to use for the output, and it employs the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options to avoid re-encoding. These commands are appropriate and should work according to FFmpeg's capabilities.\n\n2) The model's output is NOT similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain any non-existent options or mistakes in the syntax. The options and parameters used in the command are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation, and therefore it should execute correctly.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does NOT break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The usage of `-map`, along with the specified stream indices and copying the video and audio streams, complies with the options and ordering as described in the manual. The command is structured correctly for setting the input stream mappings and will function as intended.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the analysis above, the model's output passes and does not contain the issue referenced in the evaluation criteria. It successfully fulfills the user's request without any errors or violations of the FFmpeg command requirements."
