  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a media file, you can use the `-map` option. Here, you want to map video stream 0:3 and audio stream 0:5. This allows you to include only the intended streams in the output.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the streams as they are without re-encoding, you could use stream copying (`-c copy`). If re-encoding is necessary (e.g., for format compatibility), specify codecs accordingly.\n\nHere's a basic command that maps the specified streams and copies the streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nIf re-encoding is needed, specify codecs like `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` instead of `-c copy`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid for the task of selecting specific streams from a media file using `-map`, and it correctly uses the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the provided failing output example. The generated command is syntactically correct, and the options used are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command in the model's output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the proper syntax for mapping streams and correctly uses the `-c copy` option.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluation, the model's output does not contain any issues and therefore should pass."
