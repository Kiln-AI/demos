  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams, use the following parameters:\n\n* `streams` to list the available streams\n* `-map` to select the stream ranges\n* `-c:v` and `-c:a` to encode the selected streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -map 0:9 output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n* `-map 0:4` selects video stream 0, timestamp range 0 (start) to 4 (end, 5 seconds into program).\n* `-map 0:9` selects audio stream 0, timestamp range 0 (start) to 9 (end, 18 seconds into program).\n* The rest of the stream follows as in the response for `input.avi`.\n\nMake sure you check the timespan and format of your `broadcast.mkv` video file to know its range is 5 seconds for video and 18 seconds for audio (based on the parameter ranges), both in order to write them so they could fill between 5-18 secs",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain issues. It incorrectly suggests using `-map 0:4` for the video stream and `-map 0:9` for the audio stream but does not properly specify the `-c:a` for the audio track following the video track mapping. Instead, it places the command for audio after the video mapping assertion, which can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.\n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the failure example provided. It does not contain any nonexistent or invalid options like the `preset extra_fast`, which means it won't necessarily cause a failure, but it does misplace commands, which could lead to an error when the command is executed.\n\n3) The command partially adheres to the ffmpeg requirements as outlined in the man page. While `-map` is used correctly to select the streams, the sequencing and inclusion of codec commands could lead to confusion or errors. However, the command structure generally conforms to the expected format of `ffmpeg`. \n\n4) Based on the provided analysis, the model's output indeed contains an issue. Thus, it would fail the evaluation due to the improper mapping and sequencing of commands, even if the individual commands themselves are not invalid. The output does not fully meet the user's request as it may result in an incorrect command execution."
