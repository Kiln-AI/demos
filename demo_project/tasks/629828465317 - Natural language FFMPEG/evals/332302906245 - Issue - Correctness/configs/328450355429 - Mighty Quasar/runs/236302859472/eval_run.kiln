  "input": "Convert video.mov to MP4 format with lossless compression but also apply heavy compression to reduce file size",
  "output": "Lossless compression and heavy compression for reduced file size are mutually exclusive:  \n- **Lossless compression** preserves original quality and generally results in larger files.\n- **Heavy compression for small size** loses some quality to greatly reduce the file size.\n\nI'll provide **two commands**:\n1. **Lossless MP4 (best quality, large size):**  \n   Use `-c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 0` for true lossless with x264 encoder.\n2. **Heavily compressed MP4 (smaller size, lower quality):**  \n   Use `-c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 32` (increase CRF for more compression, at the cost of quality) and reduce audio bitrate.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- You want MP4 output playable in common players.\n- Source file is `video.mov`.\n\n---\n\n**1. Lossless MP4:**\nThis creates a large file with no quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 0 -c:a aac -b:a 256k -pix_fmt yuv420p output_lossless.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**2. Heavily Compressed MP4:**\nThis prioritizes small file size at the cost of quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 32 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_compressed.mp4\n```\n\n**Tip:**  \nChange `-crf` for quality/size trade-off (lower = better quality, bigger file). Values 28â€“35 are \"heavy\" compression.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output accurately describes the conflict between lossless compression and heavy compression, providing two appropriate commands for each scenario. Both commands are syntactically correct and should work as intended. Therefore, the output does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failing output example provided. The output commands generated by the model are syntactically valid and do not contain any errors such as typos in the option names or incorrect presets.\n\n3) The commands generated by the model do not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used align with the usage defined in the man page, specifically:\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 0` for lossless conversion\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 32` for heavy compression\nThe assumption made about the audio codec and other options like `-pix_fmt` and `-movflags` are also compatible with the requirements outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain an issue and therefore passes the evaluation."
