  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, use ffmpeg's `-c:a flac` codec and specify the `compression_level` parameter. For maximum compression, compression_level=8 (the highest, with a range typically from 0 to 8).\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-vn` disables video processing, extracting only audio.\n- `-c:a flac` sets the audio codec to FLAC.\n- `-compression_level 8` uses the maximum compression level.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. It incorrectly specifies the `-compression_level` option, which is not an accepted parameter in this context. The correct approach for setting the compression level for FLAC encoding is to use the `-compression_level` flag, but its exact syntax and availability depend on the version of FFmpeg being used, and the model presented it incorrectly as `-compression_level` without an explicit parameter for this relation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example because the command does not contain a reference to a non-existent preset such as `extra_fast`. However, it does contain an invalid option (`-compression_level`).\n\n3) The command does not entirely conform to the requirements laid out in the man page. The use of `-compression_level` is questionable as it does not seem to be an explicit valid option in the general FFmpeg usage and is not listed in the audio options section of the man page for FLAC. The expected command format for FLAC does not require the specification of a compression level in such a manner.\n\nBased on the above evaluation, the model's output fails to generate a valid `ffmpeg` command due to incorrect usage of a non-existent option, hence it does contain the issue described in the context, and thus fails the evaluation."
