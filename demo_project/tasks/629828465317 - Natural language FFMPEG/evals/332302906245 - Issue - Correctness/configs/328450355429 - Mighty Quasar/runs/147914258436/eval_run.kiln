  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 with a strict average video bitrate of 5000 kb/s using a variable bitrate (VBR) method:\n- Use `libx264` for H.264 video encoding (fully supported in MP4).\n- Set the target average bitrate with `-b:v 5000k` (the `k` suffix denotes kilobits, not kilobytes).\n- Define keyframe intervals (`-g 250` and `-keyint_min 25`) for better compatibility with streaming platforms.\n- Reencode audio to AAC with a reasonable default bitrate (e.g., 192 kb/s if unspecified).\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` to enable browser-friendly streaming.\n- Assume input resolution is preserved unless specified otherwise (no resizing needed).\n- As noted: true \"VBR\" isn't explicitly defined for bitrates; `-b:v` here acts as an approximate average target through quality adjustment. For precise control, consider using `CRF` instead.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -g 250 -keyint_min 25 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Notes**:\n- Video quality will still depend on the original source and encoder settings.\n- The total file bitrate will be slightly higher than 5000 kb/s (includes audio and container overhead).\n- Change `-b:a` value if your audio quality requirements differ.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output from the model meets the requirements as it correctly constructs an `ffmpeg` command to convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 file, while locking the video bitrate to 5000 kb/s using Variable Bit Rate (VBR) settings. The command includes necessary parameters and options to ensure proper encoding, which adheres to the user’s request. Therefore, the model does not contain the issue described and properly fulfills the user's request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model’s output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command produced is valid and conforms to `ffmpeg` syntax, using recognized options and parameters. Thus, it should work correctly, unlike the failing example which included a nonexistent preset option.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements according to the `ffmpeg` man page. It uses valid options (`-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-g`, `-keyint_min`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, `-movflags`) and follows the proper syntax. All parameters are correctly ordered and correspond to their respective input or output files, complying with the general rules for `ffmpeg` command usage.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; hence, it should pass the evaluation. It generated a valid and correctly structured `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's specifications."
