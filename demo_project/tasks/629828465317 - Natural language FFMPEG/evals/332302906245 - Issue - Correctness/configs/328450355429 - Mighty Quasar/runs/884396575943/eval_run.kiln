  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations, you'll use FFmpeg's filter graph with multiple filters connected by commas. The order matters: stabilize first, then apply geometric transformations, and finally color grade.\n\nHere's the approach:\n- **vidstabdetect** (first pass): Analyzes the video to detect camera shake and creates a transform file\n- **vidstabtransform** (second pass): Applies stabilization using the transform data\n- **scale**: Resizes the video (e.g., to 1080p)\n- **rotate**: Rotates the video by specified angle in radians\n- **eq**: Applies color grading (brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma)\n\nThis requires a two-pass process since vidstab needs to analyze the footage first.\n\n**Pass 1 - Detect shake:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=10:accuracy=10:result=transforms.trf -f null -\n```\n\n**Pass 2 - Apply all transformations:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf:zoom=0:smoothing=10,scale=1920:1080,rotate=5*PI/180,eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.3:gamma=0.9\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Rotating 5 degrees clockwise (5*PI/180 radians)\n- Scaling to 1080p\n- Moderate color grading adjustments\n- Using default stabilization settings (adjust shakiness/smoothing as needed)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issues described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for the user message, properly chaining stabilization, geometric transformations, and color grading without syntactical errors or inappropriate flags.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, as the generated commands are correct and use valid options associated with FFmpeg functionality. The parameters used in the command are appropriate according to the specified tasks.\n\n3) After reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, the generated command does not break any requirements dictated therein. All options used are valid and correspond to available features in FFmpeg, including the stabilization filters and transformations.\n\n4) Since the output does not contain any issues as described, and it successfully meets the userâ€™s request, it passes the evaluation."
