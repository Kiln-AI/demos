  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds as PNGs with ultra high resolution. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, extracting frames at specific intervals. The usual method is using the fps filter or the setpts filter. Since they want every 2 seconds, maybe using setpts to set the timestamp. But maybe a simpler way is to use the fps filter with a frame rate that gives one frame every 2 seconds. Wait, fps is frames per second, so 0.5 fps would give one frame every 2 seconds. But I need to check if that's the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, using the \"fps\" filter with a rate of 0.5. But I should also consider if the video's original frame rate affects this. For example, if the video is 30fps, then every 2 seconds would be 60 frames. But using fps=0.5 would reduce it to one frame every two seconds. However, maybe the user wants exactly every 2 seconds regardless of the original frame rate. So using setpts=PTS/2 would make the frame rate half, but that might not be accurate. Wait, no, setpts=PTS/2 would set the time base to 1/2, which would make the frame rate double. Hmm, maybe I need to use the \"fps\" filter with 0.5. Let me confirm.\n\nAlternatively, the \"select\" filter with nth frame. For example, selecting every nth frame. But how to specify every 2 seconds. The select filter can use expressions based on time. So, maybe using \"select=eq(t,2*n)\" where n is the frame number. But that might not be straightforward. Another way is to use the \"fps\" filter with 0.5 to get one frame every two seconds. Then, scale the output to ultra high resolution. The user said \"ultra high resolution,\" so probably the original resolution, but maybe they want a larger size. However, without knowing the original size, I can't specify a fixed dimension. So the scale filter would need to be set to the original size. But if the user wants higher than original, maybe they want a specific size, but since it's not specified, perhaps just using the original resolution. Wait, but \"ultra high resolution\" might mean keeping the original dimensions. So the scale filter would be \"scale=-1:-1\" to maintain aspect ratio, but that's the default. Wait, no, the user may want the highest possible resolution, so maybe they want to upscale. However, without knowing the original size, it's safer to assume they want the original. But the user might have a specific size in mind. Since it's not specified, perhaps the best is to scale to the original resolution. But how to do that. Alternatively, maybe they just want the frames extracted without resizing, so the default scale is okay.\n\nAnother thing: the output format is PNG, which is lossless. So the command would include the output format. Also, the video codec: since they're extracting frames, they might want to use a codec that's suitable for images, like ppm or png. But the default is probably to use the appropriate codec. However, when using the 'output' command, the format is specified with -f image2 or similar. Wait, ffmpeg's output options: when using -f image2, it will save as images. So the command would be: ffmpeg -i video.avi -vsync vfr -vf fps=0.5 -f image2 frame_%04d.png. But wait, the vsync option might be needed to avoid frame rate issues. Or maybe the fps filter is sufficient. Also, the user wants ultra high resolution, but if the video is already at that resolution, then scaling isn't needed. However, if the video is lower, maybe they want to upscale. But since the user isn't specifying a specific dimension, I can't assume. So I'll use the original resolution. However, in ffmpeg, when using fps, the output will have the same resolution as the input. So maybe the scale filter isn't needed unless they want to upscale. But the user said \"ultra high resolution,\" which could mean that they want the highest possible, so maybe the original is already high. So the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -f image2 frame_%04d.png\n\nWait, but that would generate frames every 2 seconds. However, the fps filter sets the frame rate. So if the original video is 30fps, then fps=0.5 would produce 0.5 fps, so one frame every 2 seconds. But how accurate is this? Because the fps filter is based on the input's frame rate. For example, if the input is 30fps, then 0.5 fps would mean that the output is 0.5 frames per second. So every 2 seconds. But the actual frame selection might depend on the input's frame rate. Alternatively, using the 'setpts' filter to set the timestamp. For example, setpts=PTS/2, but that's more complex. Alternatively, the select filter with a condition. For example, select='eq(mod(t,2),0)'. But that would select every 2 seconds. However, the exact timing might be better with the fps filter. But I need to make sure that the frames are extracted as every 2 seconds. So using fps=0.5 would be the straightforward way, but the frame rate might not be precise if the input's frame rate doesn't divide evenly into 2 seconds. Alternatively, the 'fps' filter is designed to do this. So the command would be: ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -f image2 frame_%04d.png. However, the user might also want to ensure that the images are saved with high quality. Since PNG is lossless, that's handled. Also, the output format is handled by -f image2. The frame numbering is frame_%04d.png, which appends numbers. But the user may need to adjust the filename format. Also, the user mentioned \"ultra high resolution,\" which might mean that the frames are extracted at the highest possible resolution, which is the original. So no scaling is needed. But if the user wants to upscale, they might need to add a scale filter. However, without knowing the target size, I can't specify. So the answer might be to use fps=0.5 and no scale, but the user might have a different requirement. But the user's instruction is to extract frames every 2 seconds and save as PNGs with ultra high resolution. Therefore, the scale filter can be omitted, as the original resolution is already the highest. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -f image2 frame_%04d.png\n\nBut wait, when using fps filter, it's possible that the output might not exactly match every 2 seconds due to frame rate rounding. For example, if the input is 30 fps, then 0.5 fps would mean 1 frame every 2 seconds. But if the input's frame rate is not 30, but say 25 fps, then 0.5 fps would result in 1 frame every 2 seconds. However, the exact timing might vary. Alternatively, using the 'select' filter with a time-based condition. For example, select='eq(t,2*floor(t/2))' or select='eq(t\\,0)' with a step of 2. But that's more complicated. Alternatively, using the 'fps' filter with a higher value. Hmm. Maybe the safest way is to use the 'fps' filter with 0.5. Additionally, the 'vsync' option. Wait, the 'fps' filter might drop frames if the input isn't exactly at the target frame rate. Alternatively, using 'fps=0.5' with 'vsync=0' to avoid any frame rate adjustment. But the user might not need that. I'll proceed with the fps=0.5 and image2 format. Also, the user wants the output as PNG images, so the default codec for image2 is ppm, but specifying the format. Wait, when using -f image2, the output format is determined by the file extension. So if the output is .png, then it's using the png codec. So the command should be correct. Also, the user might want to ensure the images are saved in high quality, but since PNG is lossless, that's handled. So the command is as above. But I should check for any parameters that might be necessary. Also, the user might want to have the frames in a specific directory, but that's not mentioned. The explanation should mention that the fps filter sets the frame rate to 0.5, which gives one frame every 2 seconds. Also, the output format is PNG using the image2 demuxer. The frame numbering is frame_%04d.png. However, the user might need to adjust the start time or have other options, but the question doesn't specify. So the answer would be to use the fps filter with 0.5 and save as PNG images.\n</think>\n\nTo extract one frame every 2 seconds from `video.avi` as ultra-high-resolution PNGs, we use the `fps` filter to control the frame rate and ensure the output uses lossless PNG encoding.\n\n- `fps=0.5` sets the frame rate to 0.5 fps, producing one frame every 2 seconds.\n- `-f image2` ensures output is treated as image sequences.\n- `frame_%04d.png` generates sequentially numbered PNG files",
