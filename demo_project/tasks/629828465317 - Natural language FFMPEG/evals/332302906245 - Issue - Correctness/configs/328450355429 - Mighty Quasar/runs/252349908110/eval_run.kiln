  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your video to H.265 (HEVC) format using the veryfast2 preset, you should:\n\n- Use the libx265 codec for H.265 video encoding.\n- Set the preset to veryfast2 to balance encoding speed and compression efficiency.\n- Adjust the quality using the CRF (Constant Rate Factor) parameter; 28 is often a good starting point for HEVC.\n- Keep the audio codec unchanged or choose appropriately; here, assume you want to copy audio.\n- Use -movflags +faststart if outputting to MP4, to optimize for streaming.\n\nHere is a command assuming your input is input.mp4 and output should be output_hevc.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 -crf 28 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_hevc.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to re-encode audio to AAC at 128 kbps for broader compatibility, replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`.\n\nThis command preserves the original audio stream and codec by default. You can change audio handling based on your needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated to convert a video to H.265 format using the \"veryfast2\" preset is logically sound, adheres to the syntax rules of `ffmpeg`, and utilizes valid options and parameters. It correctly uses the `libx265` codec for H.265 encoding, specifies a preset, and utilizes a `CRF` value. Therefore, it meets the user's request without errors.\n\n2) No, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and utilizes appropriate options, while the failure example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) includes a non-existent preset that would indeed cause an error. The command provided by the model makes use of the existing \"veryfast2\" preset correctly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It follows a logical structure, with input followed by output parameters, and all options are valid according to the `ffmpeg` syntax. The use of `-c:v libx265`, `-preset veryfast2`, and other parameters is consistent with standard usage as outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering all the points evaluated: The model's output does not contain the issue described, it does not resemble a failing output, and it complies with the man page specifications. Thus, the evaluation passes as it successfully generates a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements."
