  "input": "Help me create a complex filter that resizes, adds border, and applies motion blur. Use -vf 'scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black;mblur=radius=3' for the transformations.",
  "output": "To perform multiple filters with complex transformations in ffmpeg, use the -vf option with multiple filter expressions separated by a comma (,). The filter syntax you provided is nearly correct but has some inconsistencies:\n\n- The scale filter width or height can't both be -2 with just one explicit size set. If you want to keep the aspect ratio and give a fixed width or height, you should specify -1 or leave the size omitted.\n- mblur should only have 'radius=(int)'.\n- The pad filter parameters are width, height, x, y, and border color (optional on ffmpeg 4.2+).\n\nAssuming you want to scale the video to width 1920, keep the original height and add a black border, then apply a motion blur with radius 3:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -vf \"scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0,Formats=mblur=radius=3\" -c:a copy output.ext\n```\n\nThis will scale the video to 1920x1080, add a black border to make the frame 1920x1080, and apply motion blur with a radius of 3. \n\n- If your input video is already 1080p or smaller, or you want to keep the original height, replace \"scale=1920:1080\" with \"scale=1920:-1\" to keep the aspect ratio.\n- If you have audio, you can copy it with -c:a copy.\n- Adjust pixel format or codecs as suits your output needs.\n\nThis command assumes you choose your extension (replace \"ext\") accordingly based on your input file or desired output format.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n\nYes, the model's output contains issues. Specifically:\n- The use of `Formats=mblur=radius=3` in the generated command is incorrect. It should just be `mblur=radius=3` without the `Formats=` prefix. This suggests a misinterpretation of the filter syntax.\n- The command does not properly address the scaling requirements; the assumption that specifying `scale=1920:1080` maintains the aspect ratio is incorrect and does not allow for flexibility in case the input video does not conform to this resolution.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nWhile the output does not exhibit a clear failure like the `extra_fast` preset example, it does produce an invalid command due to the erroneous use of `Formats=`, leading to an invalid execution when the command is run.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe generated command breaks a requirement by including incorrectly formatted filter parameters. Specifically, the inclusion of `Formats=` in front of the motion blur filter syntax is not valid. Additionally, the scaling argument should optimally allow for an aspect ratio maintainability option (like using -1 if wishing to maintain the aspect ratio). Furthermore, the command does not include audio codec specifications, which may be necessary depending on the input type.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n\nThe model's output fails, as it contains significant mistakes that compromise the validity of the ffmpeg command. The use of an incorrect format for parameters and the misunderstanding of scaling make the output incomplete and functionally flawed."
