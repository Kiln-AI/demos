  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To specifically select and map the third video stream and second audio stream from multi.avi, use the ffmpeg -map option. Streams are zero-indexed, so:\n- The third video stream is index v:2\n- The second audio stream is a:1\n\nThis command will extract and combine only these two streams into final.mp4. The codecs will be copied as-is; if you need re-encoding for compatibility, add appropriate -c:v or -c:a options.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -map 0:v:2 selects the third video stream.\n- -map 0:a:1 selects the second audio stream.\n- -c copy avoids re-encoding (useful for efficiency and maintaining quality).\n- Output is saved to final.mp4.\n\nAssumptions:\n- multi.avi contains at least three video and two audio streams.\n- The streams are compatible with the MP4 container. If not, consider re-encoding (e.g., -c:v libx264 -c:a aac).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it produced is valid and meets the user's requirements to map specific streams from the source file into the output file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command it generated is correctly formatted, uses appropriate options, and should work as intended without any syntax or logical errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It uses the `-map` option correctly, specifies stream indices properly (0:v:2 for the third video stream and 0:a:1 for the second audio stream), and uses `-c copy` to copy the codecs, which is a supported and valid method according to the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is appropriate, functional, and meets the user's requests effectively. Therefore, it passes all evaluation steps without issue."
