  "input": "Take my 4K video `drone.mp4` and make it lossless, but the final file size must be under 20MB.",
  "output": "To create a lossless version of your 4K video under 20MB, you'll need to significantly reduce the resolution since true lossless compression of 4K video typically results in very large files. I'll use FFV1 codec (lossless) with aggressive scaling.\n\nThe approach is to scale down the resolution dramatically while maintaining lossless quality at the new resolution. Since 20MB is extremely small for any significant length of 4K video, I'm assuming this is either a very short clip or you're okay with substantial resolution reduction.\n\n- `vf scale=640:360` scales down to 360p (you may need to go even smaller depending on video length)\n- `c:v ffv1` uses FFV1 lossless video codec\n- `c:a flac` uses FLAC for lossless audio compression\n- `level 3` enables FFV1's highest compression level\n- `coder 1` uses range coder for better compression\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i drone.mp4 -vf scale=640:360 -c:v ffv1 -level 3 -coder 1 -c:a flac output.mkv\n```\n\n**Note**: You may need to experiment with even smaller resolutions (like 480:270 or 320:180) if the file is still over 20MB. The final size depends heavily on your video's length and content complexity. For a true 20MB limit with longer videos, lossless compression may not be feasible - consider high-quality lossy compression instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. While the command provided may work syntactically and creates a lossless video, it does not satisfy the requirement of keeping the final file size under 20MB. Given that lossless video, especially at a resolution as high as 4K, results in very large file sizes, significant compression techniques need to be implemented beyond just resolution scaling in order to achieve the specified size limit.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided, as the command syntax itself is correct, and the codecs specified are valid. However, the command does not achieve the goal of keeping file size under 20MB, which is a significant issue.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg, as all options used are legitimate. However, the final command does not meet the userâ€™s file size request and fails to consider the intricacies of lossless compression with the given resolution and size constraints.\n\n4) Since the output contains the issue of not being able to meet the user's requirement to keep the final file size under 20MB with a lossless 4K video, it is judged to fail. This is a crucial aspect of the task, as adhering to specified constraints is a critical component of effective command generation."
