  "output": "To extract specific streams from a media file, you can use ffmpeg's stream selection with the `-map` option. In this case, selecting video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 involves specifying those streams explicitly and then saving them into a new file. No re-encoding is necessary if you're just copying streams.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the streams exactly as they are (without re-encoding), the command will copy the streams directly to speed up processing and avoid quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select specific video and audio streams from the input file and uses `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which aligns with the user's request to save them as trimmed.mp4.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated does not contain any invalid options or non-existent presets, and it adheres to the syntax and options supported by ffmpeg as described in the man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the proper syntax for selecting streams with the `-map` option and specifies the output file correctly without introducing any erroneous parameters.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully fulfills the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
