  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "Certainly! To extract the audio track 5 from `input.mov` and combine it with the original video, you'll need to use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include in the output file. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n- `-map 0:v` extracts the video stream from the first (0-based) input file (i.e., `input.mov`).\n- `-map 0:a:4` extracts the 5th audio stream (0-based index, so 4 is the 5th) from the first input file.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding it, which is efficient.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:4 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `-map 0:v` command line tells `ffmpeg` to copy the video stream from the first file.\n- The `-map 0:a:4` command line tells `ffmpeg` to copy the 5th audio stream from the first file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` instruct `ffmpeg` not to re-encode the video and audio, just copy them, which is more efficient and preserves the original quality.\n\nThis command should create an `output.mp4` file that contains the original video and the audio track 5 from `input.mov`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated appears to correctly extract the specified audio track and map it with the video from the same input file as requested by the user. The use of `-map` and codec copying (`-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`) is appropriate for this task, aligning with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command does not have any mistakes that would lead to it failing to execute. The parameters used are valid and correctly applied according to the ffmpeg command structure.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options are appropriately used:\n\n- The `-map` options correctly specify which streams from the input file to include in the output.\n- The `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options properly indicate that the model intends to copy the respective streams without any re-encoding, which is allowed by the ffmpeg specification.\n\n4) Since the model's output correctly produces a valid command that adheres to the specifications laid out by the user and does not break any rules from the ffmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation. Thus, it does not contain any issues as described in the evaluation queries."
