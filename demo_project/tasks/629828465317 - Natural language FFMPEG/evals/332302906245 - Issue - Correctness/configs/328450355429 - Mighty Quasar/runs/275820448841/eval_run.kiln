  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To reduce the size of `video.mp4`, we can lower the video quality using the `-crf` parameter (Constant Rate Factor) and reduce the audio bitrate. This will significantly shrink the file size while maintaining acceptable visual and audio quality for most purposes.\n\n- `-crf 28` reduces the quality compared to the default of 23, which increases compression and reduces file size. Note that this may affect visual quality.\n- `-b:a 64k` reduces the audio bitrate from the default (usually 128k) to 64k, further minimizing file size.\n- `-preset fast` ensures a quicker encoding process while still providing decent compression.\n\nAssuming the video is in MP4 format and you want to keep it as MP4, this should work well for email purposes.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -crf 28 -b:a 64k -preset fast output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -crf 28 -b:a 64k -preset fast output.mp4`) is a valid command that adheres to FFmpeg's syntax and options. It provides a clear approach to reducing the file size of the video as requested by the user. \n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any invalid options; all parameters used are consistent with FFmpeg's accepted options.\n\n3) The command does **not break any requirements** dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The `-crf`, `-b:a`, and `-preset` parameters used in the command are all valid and commonly used options in FFmpeg for controlling quality and encoding speed.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described, is not similar to a failing output, and does not violate any requirements in the man page, it can be concluded that it has successfully transformed the user input into a correct FFmpeg command. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
