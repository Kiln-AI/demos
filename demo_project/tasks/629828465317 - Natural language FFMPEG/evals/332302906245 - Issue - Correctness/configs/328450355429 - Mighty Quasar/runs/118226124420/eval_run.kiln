  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map the original video stream and only the third audio stream from your input file, you can use the `-map` option. The video stream is typically the first video stream (`0:v:0`), and the third audio stream is `0:a:2` (since counting starts at 0). This will copy the streams without reencoding by using `-c copy`.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis assumes your input file's first video stream is the one you want and the third audio stream exists. The output container is MKV to preserve all features.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is appropriate for the userâ€™s request to copy the original video and map the third audio track from the input file. The use of the `-map` option is correctly applied, and `-c copy` ensures that both the video and audio streams are copied without re-encoding.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model does not contain any mistakes or invalid parameters; it correctly uses the available options in `ffmpeg`. The command is logically sound and complies with the mapping specified by the user.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nNo, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. The model appropriately uses:\n- `-i movie.mkv` for input,\n- `-map 0:v:0` for mapping the first video stream,\n- `-map 0:a:2` for mapping the third audio stream,\n- `-c copy` to copy both streams without re-encoding,\nand specifies the output file as `output.mkv`. All of these are in accordance with the command structure and requirements outlined in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation criteria. Therefore, it should pass; it has accurately generated a command that meets the user's requirements without any mistakes."
