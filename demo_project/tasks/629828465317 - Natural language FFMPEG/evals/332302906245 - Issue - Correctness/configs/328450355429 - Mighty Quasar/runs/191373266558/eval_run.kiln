  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "For rapid compression of a large MKV file using the turbo preset, encode the video with H.264 (libx264) using a faster preset (turbo) which decreases encoding time at some cost to compression efficiency. Also, use a standard quality level via CRF (22-24) for balanced quality and size savings. Audio can be copied if compatible or re-encoded at a reasonable bitrate if not. The resulting MP4 will be more widely compatible than MKV but also consider the output file extension accordingly.\n\n- -c:v libx264: Use H.264 video codec.\n- -preset turbo: Use the \"turbo\" preset for faster encoding.\n- -crf 22: Quality settingâ€”lower means better quality (22 is a good default for balance).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k: Convert audio to AAC at 192 kbps for wide compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart: Optimize MP4 for streaming (if using MP4 output).\n- Output as .mp4 for modern device compatibility, or .mkv to retain original container if preferred.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 22 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart compressed_movie.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:**  \n- If you want to keep the MKV container, replace `.mp4` with `.mkv` and omit `-movflags +faststart`.  \n- Adjust `-crf` for a closer balance of quality and size if desired; lower is higher quality.  \n- For even faster encoding, you can reduce the `-crf` value slightly (to 21 or 20), but beware of quality loss.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model is correct and should work properly according to the user's request to compress the `movie.mkv` file using the turbo preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The generated command `ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 22 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart compressed_movie.mp4` uses valid options and parameters. The \"turbo\" preset is indeed a recognized preset in ffmpeg for faster encoding, unlike the nonexistent preset \"extra_fast\" in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used are valid; specifically:\n   - \"-c:v libx264\" specifies the H.264 codec correctly.\n   - \"-preset turbo\" is a valid preset for quick encoding.\n   - \"-crf 22\" is an acceptable value for the constant rate factor.\n   - \"-c:a aac -b:a 192k\" uses valid audio settings, specifying a supported codec and bitrate.\n   - \"-movflags +faststart\" is correct for optimizing MP4 files for web streaming.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass."
