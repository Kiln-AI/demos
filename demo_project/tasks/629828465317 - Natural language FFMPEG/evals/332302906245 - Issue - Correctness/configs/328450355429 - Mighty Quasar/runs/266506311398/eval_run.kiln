  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode a .webm file to MP4 using the \"rocket\" preset for the fastest encoding, you should:\n- Use H.264 video encoding with libx264.\n- Use the \"rocket\" preset, which prioritizes speed over compression efficiency.\n- Optionally, encode audio via MP3 for widespread compatibility (or copy if you want to preserve the original).\n- Use -movflags +faststart to optimize playback starting mid-file.\n\nThe \"rocket\" preset is ideal for blazing-fast encoding but results in larger files or less compression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset rocket -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart video.mp4\n```\n\nIf you prefer to keep the original audio (hevc), and it's compatible, substitute -c:a copy instead of -c:a aac:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset rocket -c:a copy -movflags +faststart video.mp4\n```\n\nLet me know if you want to optimize size at the expense of some encoding time, and I can adjust the preset accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. It suggests using the `rocket` preset which does not exist in FFmpeg. The predefined presets in FFmpeg are typically named `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, `faster`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, and `veryslow`. Thus, the command would not work correctly as it references a non-existent preset.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the example of a failing output given as the `rocket` preset is invalid, similar to the `extra_fast` example from the failure example. The command would not function, leading to an error because it references an unknown option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page, besides the invalid `rocket` preset. The syntax and structure of the command comply with the general rules outlined in the man page, but the invalid preset means the command won't execute successfully.\n\n4) Given that the model's output contains a reference to a non-existent preset (`rocket`), it fails to meet the requirement as it would not generate a functioning command."
