  "output": "To transform the input.mp4 file into an MKV container using the x265 encoder with the `veryslow` preset and copy the video stream, we re-encode the video using the latest and most efficient HEVC/H.265 codec and switch to the MKV format (which is container-agnostic to HEVC). Since the video stream is being re-encoded, we apply the `veryslow` preset for maximum compression efficiency, while the audio stream is preserved by using `-c:a copy`.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file uses a video codec that requires re-encoding (e.g., H.264).\n- The resolution and frame rate will be preserved unless otherwise specified.\n- Audio stream is compatible with copy and is not re-encoded.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly follows the user's request to convert the input file from MP4 to MKV, using the x265 encoder with the veryslow preset and copying the audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. It uses a valid preset (`veryslow`) and provides a command that should work without any known issues.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct syntax for specifying the input file, using the `-c:v libx265` option to set the encoder, and the `-c:a copy` option to copy the audio stream.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described, correctly follows the user's requirements, and adheres to the man page specifications. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
