  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure your video works on the widest possible array of devices, encode with the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codecâ€”these are universally supported by most media players and devices. Use a pixel format of yuv420p for maximum compatibility and set -movflags +faststart to optimize for streaming. For best balance of quality and file size, choose crf 23 and a medium preset.\n\nHere's a breakdown of key parameters:\n- -c:v libx264 uses the H.264 video encoder.\n- -c:a aac uses AAC audio encoding.\n- -b:a 128k sets audio bitrate; 128kbps is a common choice for general compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart puts MP4 metadata at the beginning for fast playback in browsers and on iOS/Android.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility with all players, including older ones.\n- -crf 23 offers reasonable quality at a manageable file size.\n- -preset medium balances encoding speed and compression efficiency (can use slow for smaller files).\n\nAssuming your input is named input.mp4, this command produces output.mp4 ready for playback on all devices:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nYou can replace input.mp4 and output.mp4 with your actual filenames as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated is valid and does not include any errors that would cause the command to fail. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model does not contain any nonexistent options or parameters, and all used options are coherent with the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n3) Upon examining the command generated by the model, it does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All parameters are correctly applied according to the output file context, which ensures proper video and audio encoding without breaking any rules regarding the ordering of options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass this evaluation. The generated command is correct and meets the user's request for maximum compatibility across devices."
