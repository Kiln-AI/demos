  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "To apply deinterlacing (YADIF with mode=1), scaling to 1920Ã—1080 resolution, and sharpening (unsharp filter), use the following ffmpeg command. This assumes you want to maintain compatibility for playback (e.g., browsers) by converting to `yuv420p` pixel format and H.264/AAC codecs.\n\n### Key Parameters:\n- **`yadif=1`**: Deinterlaces input using a spatiotemporal algorithm (mode=1). This requires 2 passes to avoid inter-frame artifacts unless the input itself is a progressive source.\n- **`scale=1920:1080`**: Forces exact output resolution. This ignores aspect ratio unless the input is already 16:9.\n- **`unsharp`**: Sharpens the video (`luma_amount=1.0` is moderate sharpening). Chroma sharpening is optional (added here).\n- **`pix_fmt yuv420p`**: Ensures compatibility with devices/browsers that don't support other pixel formats.\n\nIf your input is interlaced and has an aspect ratio different from 1920:1080, you might see black bars or stretching. For adaptive scaling (while preserving aspect ratio), consider replacing `scale=1920:1080` with `scale=-2:1080` (autowidth) or `scale=1280:-2` (autoheight).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"yadif=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0:chroma_msize_x=5:chroma_msize_y=5:chroma_amount=0.5\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n### Notes:\n1. **YADIF**: Run `yadif=mode=1` for two-pass deinterlacing. Change to `mode=0` for spatiotemporal with one pass if needed.\n2. **Unsharp**: The chroma sharpening parameters (`chroma_msize_x/y` and `chroma_amount`) are added for balanced results by default. Adjust strength by scaling luma_amount (e.g., `luma_amount=1.5` for stronger sharpening).\n3. If the input audio is not already AAC-compatible, the `-c:a aac` ensures it is re-encoded properly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output produced by the model appears to be correct and adheres to the user's request for applying temporal and spatial filters with the specified parameters (YADIF for deinterlacing, scaling to 1920x1080, sharpening with unsharp). The command it produced correctly implements these filters in the specified order. The additional choices regarding codecs and pixel format are logical given the common formats used for media files. Thus, it does not contain the described issue.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output does not resemble the provided failing output example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command generated by the model utilizes valid parameters and does not include any non-existent or incorrect options (e.g., an incorrect preset).\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break any requirements from the man page. All options used are recognized by FFmpeg, and parameters are appropriately applied in the correct order. The command structure follows the guidelines set in the man page, and there are no violations of expected syntax (e.g., placing filters before the codec specifications).\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. It provides a valid FFmpeg command that fulfills the user's requirements for applying filters and correct formatting without syntax errors. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
