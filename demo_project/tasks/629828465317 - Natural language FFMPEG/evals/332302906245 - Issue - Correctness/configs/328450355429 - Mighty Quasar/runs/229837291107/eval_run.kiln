  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure your video works on virtually all devices with maximum compatibility, convert it to MP4 format using the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec, with a pixel format of yuv420p. These settings are widely supported even on older devices. Additionally, placing the metadata at the start of the file with -movflags +faststart facilitates immediate playback when streaming.\n\nHereâ€™s a breakdown of best practices for maximum compatibility:\n- -c:v libx264 for H.264 encoding (most universal video codec).\n- -c:a aac for AAC audio (broadly supported).\n- -strict experimental enables AAC if your build requires it.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures playback on legacy hardware.\n- -movflags +faststart moves the moov atom for faster streaming/start times.\n- -profile:v baseline ensures compatibility with very old devices (though can be omitted for modern targets).\n- -level 3.0 or 3.1 for wide device support.\n\nAssuming your input is input.mkv and you want output.mp4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will convert your video for maximum compatibility across all devices.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step as per the outlined criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe output provided by the model does not contain any apparent mistakes in the ffmpeg command it generates. The command appears technically correct and aligns with the user's request for \"maximum compatibility settings\". Thus, it successfully fulfills the requirement without issue.\n\n**Evaluation: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nThe example of a failing output provided (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) showcases a command with a non-existent preset, which would certainly fail. The command generated by the model does not have any such known errors or misconfigurations. Therefore, it does not resemble the described failure example.\n\n**Evaluation: Pass**\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nUpon review of the command generated by the model against the ffmpeg man page, all parameters used comply with the documented requirements. There are no conflicts or violations noted in the argument options or command structure. The command logically follows the expected input-output format for ffmpeg commands.\n\n**Evaluation: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nBased on the evaluations conducted, the model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. It is correct and adheres to command line rules specified in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should pass.\n\n**Final Evaluation: Pass**"
