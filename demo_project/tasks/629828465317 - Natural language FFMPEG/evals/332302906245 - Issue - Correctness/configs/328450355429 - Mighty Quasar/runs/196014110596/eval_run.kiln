  "input": "I want to encode my video with the flash preset to get the conversion done as quickly as possible.",
  "output": " To encode your video using the fast preset for flash player, and assuming your videos are compatible with that (480p or higher), the following FFmpeg command applies:\n\n\n- Use the `libx264` codec for H.264 video encoding.\n\n- Set the preset to flash for speed; this might improve encoding time but sacrifices quality at the cost of a higher bitrate.\n\n- Configure quality by setting the CRF value (a lower CRF means better quality and higher bitrate). For flash, a succinct 10 suffices; it strikes a good balance between quality and file size.\n\n- Utilize the AAC codec for audio (128kbps is a common choice) and target an audio bitrate of 128k.\n\n- Retain the original aspect ratio when resizing the video with `-vf scale=-2:480`.\n\n- Set the pixel format to yuv420p for compatibility with a wide range of devices, including older ones, and to ensure playback on the Adobe Flash Player.\n\n- Use the +movflags option to add the +faststart flag, which places the index, chapter information, and other metadata at the start of the file to enable quicker streaming.\n\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:480 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 10 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_for_flash.mp4\n```\n\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Your original `input.mp4` file is in a format supported by ffmpeg (this solution assumes MP4; if it's MPEG-2, additional transcoding steps would be needed).\n\n- The Flash Player used is compatible with the specified settings. For newer browsing environments, consider using HTML5 video tags instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does *not* contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated is largely appropriate for the user requirements of quickly encoding a video for Flash playback, and incorporates relevant parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is *not* similar to the given failure example. The command produced by the model uses `-preset fast`, which is a valid preset for FFmpeg, unlike the `extra_fast` preset used in the failure example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does *not* break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the command structure correctly, specifying input and output files, and sets parameters in a valid order.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue specified, and thus it passes this evaluation."
