  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream source file, use the `-map` parameter to select which video and audio streams to include in the output. Stream indexing starts at 0, so the third video stream is index 2 and the second audio stream is index 1.\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (index 2) from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (index 1) from input 0\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest, maintains original quality)\n\nI'm assuming you want to preserve the original quality and codecs of the selected streams. If you need specific encoding parameters, those can be added.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The generated command correctly maps the specified streams (third video and second audio) and uses the appropriate syntax and options for ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, which shows an incorrect command with a nonexistent preset. The command generated by the model follows correct structure and all options used are valid.\n\n3) Reviewing the ffmpeg man page, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements stated in the man page. The use of the `-map` options, along with the `-c copy` option for stream copying, is correct and aligns with the documented parameters for mapping and codec options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues as per the criteria mentioned, it passes the evaluation. The command it generated is appropriate for the user's request."
