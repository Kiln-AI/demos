  "output": "To create a new file containing only video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from your `recording.mkv` file, we use the `-map` option to explicitly select stream indexes and `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding (faster and preserves quality if codecs are compatible). This assumes:\n1. The input file's streams are referenced by index (not program ID).\n2. The target container (MKV) supports these streams as-is.\n3. You want a lossless copy; re-encoding (e.g., to MP4) would require different parameters.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file. It utilizes the correct parameters and structure, making it a valid command according to `ffmpeg` standards.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not include any obvious errors or invalid options like the \"extra_fast\" preset from the failure example. It correctly uses `-map` and `-c copy`, both of which are valid and appropriate for the user's request.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly follows the syntax for specifying input files and mapping the streams. The use of `-map` to specify video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the input file is allowed, and `-c copy` is correctly applied.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command produced is correct and matches the user's requirements, thus it should pass the evaluation."
