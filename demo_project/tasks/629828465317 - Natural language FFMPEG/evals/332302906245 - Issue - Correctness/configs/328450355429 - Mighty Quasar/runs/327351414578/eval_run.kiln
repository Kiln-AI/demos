  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert `video.mkv` to MP4 with **4K resolution (3840×2160)** and compress it heavily for email, we use H.264 (universal compatibility) and reduce bitrate/quality. The tradeoff is lower file size, but significant quality loss may occur. Key parameters include:\n\n- **Resolution**: `-vf scale=3840:2160` forces 4K just for output container size (if input is larger, this compresses; if smaller, it upscales recklessly, degrading quality).\n- **CRF 30**: A high CRF value for minimal file size (lower values = better quality; 30 is visibly low quality).\n- **Low audio bitrate**: `-b:a 32k` for tiny audio size (mono audio if needed).\n- **Ultrafast preset**: `-preset ultrafast` minimizes encoding time while sacrificing compression efficiency.\n\nNote: Upgrading to 4K may not reduce size if the source isn't larger. For the smallest file, consider reducing resolution *and* using a slow preset together. However, this command adheres strictly to the user’s explicit 4K request.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -crf 30 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 32k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output_email.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model contains valid syntax and parameters that are appropriate for the user's request of converting a video to MP4 format with 4K resolution while compressing it for a small file size suitable for email attachment.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced (`ffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:2160 -c:v libx264 -crf 30 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 32k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output_email.mp4`) is syntactically correct and uses valid options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. All options and arguments used are valid and follow the expected format for ffmpeg.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is valid, correctly matches the user's requirements, and does not contain any syntactical or logical errors based on the input provided. Therefore, the model's output passes all evaluation steps."
