    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The output is empty and does not provide any command or explanation related to the user's request about setting the frame rate.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the example of a failing output provided. It comprises only empty spaces and symbols, rather than a coherent ffmpeg command.\n\n3) Yes, the output does break the requirements dictated in the man page because it does not include a valid ffmpeg command or any parameters.\n\n4) Given that the model's output is entirely void of useful information, it fails because it does not meet the user's request or provide a functioning command. Thus, it does contain the issue described."
