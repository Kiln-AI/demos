  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mp4` and save it as FLAC while applying noise reduction, use FFmpeg's noise reduction filter (`anlmdn`) and the FLAC encoder. Note that noise reduction is most effective **before** encoding to FLAC (a lossless format), as it preserves the processed signal without compression artifacts. For lossy source audio (e.g., AAC or MP3 in the video), noise reduction may still help but won't improve the inherent quality loss.\n\n- `-vn`: Disables video recording.\n- `-af anlmdn`: Applies the Noise Like-First Degrade Minus Noise (ANLMDN) filter for noise reduction. This adaptive filter reduces background noise (may require multiple passes for optimal effects).\n- `-c:a flac`: Encodes audio to FLAC.\n- `-compression_level 12`: Sets maximum compression for FLAC (optional for higher efficiency; adjust if needed).\n- `-strict -1`: Overrides \"experimental\" codec warnings if necessary (e.g., older or custom builds).\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The video has an audio stream.\n- ANLMDN (default noise reduction method in FFmpeg) is sufficient. If the noise has a strong pattern, consider advanced filters like `afftdn` or `hqdn3d` after testing.\n- The output will be a high-fidelity FLAC file. If the source uses a lossy codec (e.g., AAC), the noise reduction only affects audible noise, not compression artifacts.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af anlmdn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model follows the specified requirements of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as FLAC while applying noise reduction. The use of the `-vn`, `-af anlmdn`, `-c:a flac`, and other options are correctly used in the context of the task.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The command generated does not include any apparent invalid parameters or incorrect syntax that would lead to failure in execution.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe generated command adheres to the man page specifications for FFmpeg. The options are appropriately ordered, and all specified commands correspond to valid FFmpeg options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output does not contain the issue and should pass as it correctly generates a command that works according to the user's request for extracting audio from a video file, while also applying noise reduction and encoding to FLAC format."
