  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as ultra high-resolution PNG images, we can use the following technique:\n\n- `-i video.avi` specifies the input file.\n- `-vf fps=0.5` sets the frame rate to 0.5 frames per second, meaning one frame is extracted every 2 seconds. This is achieved by setting the frame rate to 1/2 of the original.\n- `-s WxH` can be used to set the resolution, but since you want ultra high-resolution, we will use the original resolution of the video by omitting this option.\n- `-q:v 2` sets the quality of the output PNG images to the highest level (lower is better).\n- `%03d` is a filename pattern that will be replaced with a zero-padded three-digit number for each frame.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -q:v 2 output_%03d.png\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The original resolution of the video is considered ultra high-resolution.\n- The video's native frame rate is faster than 0.5 fps (2 seconds per frame).\n- The video is in a format that can be decoded by ffmpeg.\n\nNote: The extracted frames will be saved as output_001.png, output_002.png, and so on, in the current working directory.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be correct and matches the user's requirements for extracting frames every 2 seconds from the video at the original high resolution.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any invalid options or incorrect parameters that would cause it to fail. The command is built correctly according to the user's specifications.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All the options used in the command are valid according to the provided documentation. Specifically:\n   - The `-i` option for input is used correctly.\n   - The `-vf` option which applies a filter for extracting every 2 seconds is valid.\n   - The quality setting for PNG images using `-q:v 2` is appropriate as well.\n   - The filename pattern `%03d` adheres to the requirements for output file naming.\n\n4) Given that the output passes all evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should be marked as **successful**."
