  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "For a 2-pass encoding with the libvp9 codec which is mainly used for VP9 video encoding, we will omit this into consideration because in existing ffmpeg releases, the best available VP9 codec is commonly referenced libvpx or x264 due to libvp9 being mainly supported in the VPU (Video Processing Unit) acceleration on certain platforms. If we are on an environment set up to utilize libvp9 without CPU decoding, the command would look as follows:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvp9 -b:v 5M -pass 1 -f null /dev/null -pass 2 -c:a copy output_2p_pass0.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080\" output_2p_pass2.ipp -c:v libvp9 -b:v 5M -pass 1 -f null /dev/null -pass 2 -c:a copy output_final.avi\n```\n\nHowever, this command is somewhat conceptual since a proper VP9 2-pass setup in ffmpeg for non-CPU decoders (VPUs) cannot be implemented exactly this way, as ffmpeg doesn't directly support 2-pass encoding with AV1/VP9 encoders directly in all setups. The example shows a typical AVI output command with constant bitrate (so no 2-pass), `f null /dev/null` which discards the output of the first pass literally, and a direct 2-pass encoded referencable file that ffmpeg would normally use, which is represented by `.ipp` (Intel Parser Output) and not directly `output_2p_pass0.mp0`. In actuality, proper 2-pass encoding would be best handled through specialized encoding software like `ffv1` compilers with `AV1` or encoding with `vp9enc` tool per VP9 encoding standards. Please refer to local encoding tools or consult `ffmpeg` changelogs for future support on libVP9 2-pass encoding utilities.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains issues. The command structure has several problems, including misplacement of parameters and an incorrect understanding of how to implement the 2-pass encoding correctly with VP9 in FFmpeg.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, the output is similar to the failing output example as it shows an incorrect and incoherent command. The syntax is flawed, with the inclusion of `output_2p_pass0.mp4`, `.ipp`, and other sections that don't adhere to proper FFmpeg command structure.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the command breaks multiple requirements outlined in the man page. For example, the use of multiple output filenames in a conflicting manner is incorrect. The two-pass encoding syntax is not followed properly, and the specification of the output files is not aligned with standard FFmpeg command guidelines.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output has significant issues and fails to meet the requirements dictated by both the user's request and the FFmpeg command structure outlined in the man page."
