  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformation filters in ffmpeg, you use the `-vf` (video filter) option with multiple filters separated by commas. The filters are applied in the order you specify.\n\n- Stabilization often requires two steps: analyzing motion and then applying the transformation. ffmpeg's `vidstab` filter suite handles this.\n- Color grading can be done with filters like `curves`, `eq`, or `lut3d` depending on complexity.\n- Geometric transformations like rotation and scaling use `rotate` and `scale`.\n\nAssuming you have already generated the transformation file for stabilization using `vidstabdetect`, here is how you can chain them:\n\n1. Apply stabilization with `vidstabtransform` filter.\n2. Apply color grading with, e.g., `eq` filter (brightness, contrast, saturation).\n3. Apply rotation and scaling with `rotate` and `scale`.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf,eq=contrast=1.2:brightness=0.05:saturation=1.3,rotate=PI/6,scale=1280:720\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of filters:\n- `vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf` applies the stabilization with smoothing parameter of 30 using the prior calculated transform file.\n- `eq=contrast=1.2:brightness=0.05:saturation=1.3` adjusts color grading by increasing contrast, brightness, and saturation.\n- `rotate=PI/6` rotates the video by 30 degrees (Ï€/6 radians).\n- `scale=1280:720` scales output to 1280x720 resolution.\n\nNote: \n- You need to run `vidstabdetect` first to create `transforms.trf` for stabilization.\n- Rotation angle is in radians.\n- Scaling is last so it applies to the already rotated frame.\n\nIf you want a different rotation, replace `PI/6` accordingly. You can adjust color grading parameters or use a more complex filter like `curves` or 3D LUTs.\n\nLet me know if you want an example for the detection step or more advanced color grading!",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step based on the provided guidelines.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output command generated by the model appropriately chains the stabilization (`vidstabtransform`), color grading (`eq`), and geometric transformations (`rotate` and `scale`) using the `-vf` option in a syntactically correct manner. Each filter appears to be well-formed and logically placed according to the specified order. Thus, the command does not contain the issues mentioned in the issue description and would work correctly, assuming all the filters are available and properly configured in the user's ffmpeg setup.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to an example of a failing output?**  \nThe provided command does not resemble the failing output example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). It specifies a command with valid filters and parameters, without any obvious incorrect configurations like a non-existent preset. Therefore, it does not match the characteristics of a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements as defined in the ffmpeg man page. All specified filters and options are valid, and the order of operations is appropriate based on the description provided. No conflicts or issues arise in the parameters used, and the format of the command complies with the expected syntax outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**  \nThe model's output passes the evaluation criteria as it generates a valid and functional ffmpeg command without breaking any requirements from the man page. Based on this assessment, the output does not contain the issues as described, nor does it resemble a failing command from the provided examples. Overall, it delivers a relevant response to the user's request and fulfills its intended purpose effectively."
