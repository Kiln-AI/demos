  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-track input, use `-map` to explicitly select which tracks to include in the output. Since you want stream 6 (video) and stream 9 (audio), we'll map these specific streams by their indexes.\n\n- `-map 0:v:5` selects the 6th video stream (indexing starts at 0)\n- `-map 0:a:8` selects the 9th audio stream\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding to maintain quality\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:5 -map 0:a:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm assuming the input file is named \"input.mp4\" and the streams are in the format of separate video (v) and audio (a) streams. The `-c copy` argument preserves the original codecs, which requires that the original streams' formats are compatible with MP4 container standards.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams and uses the `-c copy` parameter to copy the data without re-encoding. Therefore, it meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and does not contain any nonexistent options or parameters, whereas the failure example uses a parameter that is clearly incorrect. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The mapping of streams with `-map` is correctly implemented, and the structure of the command follows the expected format for ffmpeg commands. All options used conform to what is defined in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, I conclude that the model's output is correct, appropriately constructed, and meets the requirements of the user input. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
