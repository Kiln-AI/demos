  "input": "Convert audio.aac to MP3 with ultra_fast_encode preset for quick processing",
  "output": "To convert AAC to MP3 with the fastest encoding speed, use the libmp3lame encoder with the preset optimized for speed over quality.\n\nThe `-preset ultrafast` parameter prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, making this ideal for quick batch processing or when time is more important than file size optimization. The default quality settings will still produce reasonable audio quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.aac -c:a libmp3lame -preset ultrafast output.mp3\n```\n\nNote: I assumed you want to maintain the original audio quality settings (bitrate, sample rate). If you need specific quality settings, you can add parameters like `-b:a 192k` for a specific bitrate or `-q:a 2` for variable bitrate quality control.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command generated by the model is correctly formatted to convert an AAC audio file to MP3, using the `libmp3lame` encoder and the `-preset ultrafast` parameter. It also explains the choice of parameters appropriately.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in <failure_example>, as the model correctly uses `-preset ultrafast`, which is a valid option. The command will execute correctly without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The syntax is correct, and the options used are consistent with the descriptions provided in the man page. It does not violate the general rules for ffmpeg command usage.\n\n4) It can be concluded that the model's output does not contain the issue described, indicating that it should pass the evaluation. The command is correctly structured and appropriate for the task."
