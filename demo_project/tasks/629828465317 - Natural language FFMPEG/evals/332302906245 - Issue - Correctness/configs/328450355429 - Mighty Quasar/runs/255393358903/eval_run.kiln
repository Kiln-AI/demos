  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-track input to a new output, you can use the `-map` option. Here, you want to take video stream 6 and audio stream 9 and combine them into output.mp4.\n\nAssuming the streams are zero-indexed (ffmpeg starts counting streams at 0), `-map 0:6` means the 7th stream of the input (usually stream specifier format is `input_index:stream_index`), and `-map 0:9` the 10th stream (audio). Also, to ensure compatibility with MP4 and browser playback, use H.264 for video and AAC for audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input` with your actual input filename. If your input has only one file, `0` corresponds to that input's stream. This command will create a new file without modifying the original.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step according to the provided criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the input file. It also employs valid codec options for encoding the output in MP4 format. Therefore, it does **not** contain the issue described, as the command generated should work correctly given that the specified stream indices are valid.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output provided by the model is significantly different from the failing example. The failing example contains an invalid preset (`extra_fast`), whereas the model’s output uses correct and recognized options (`-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` for video and audio encoding, respectively). Consequently, the output does not resemble the failing example and **does not fail according to this criterion**.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the guidelines set in the FFmpeg man page. It properly sequentially applies options and maps the appropriate streams. `-map` usage is correct, and the command order follows the expected syntax outlined in the man page. Thus, the command **does not break any requirements dictated in the man page**.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   - **Pass**: The command does not contain any issues, it follows the proper structure, and there are no apparent mistakes in the generated command. Therefore, it should work as intended, fulfilling the user’s request accurately.\n\n**Final Evaluation**: The model's output is correct and effectively addresses the user’s requirements without encountering any of the described issues."
