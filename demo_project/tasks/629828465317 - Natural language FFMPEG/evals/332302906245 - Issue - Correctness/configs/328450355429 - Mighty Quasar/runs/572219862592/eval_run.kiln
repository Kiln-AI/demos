  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast preset for very quick encoding, I'll use H.264 video codec with the fastest encoding preset available.\n\nThe `ultrafast` preset prioritizes encoding speed over file size and quality - it's the fastest preset available in x264. Note that there isn't an \"ultrafast2\" preset specifically, so I'm using `ultrafast` which is the fastest option. This will result in larger file sizes and potentially lower quality compared to slower presets, but encoding will be very fast.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding\n- `-preset ultrafast` maximizes encoding speed at the cost of compression efficiency\n- `-c:a aac` converts audio to AAC format (standard for MP4)\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility with players and devices\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p movie.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: I used `ultrafast` instead of \"ultrafast2\" since that's not a valid x264 preset. If you need even faster processing, you could add `-crf 28` or higher for lower quality but faster encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is valid and matches the user requirements, effectively transforming the `.mkv` file to an MP4 format with the specified ultra-fast preset.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the failure example. The command produced is valid and utilizes correct options and values. Specifically, it correctly indicates the \"ultrafast\" preset and generates a proper command format, unlike the invalid `extra_fast` preset in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The syntax is correct with appropriate options applied to the command for input conversion, including the necessary codecs and parameters specified.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues associated with generating a valid ffmpeg command. The command should successfully execute as intended, turning the video file `movie.mkv` into an MP4 format using the fast encoding preset. Thus, it passes evaluation."
