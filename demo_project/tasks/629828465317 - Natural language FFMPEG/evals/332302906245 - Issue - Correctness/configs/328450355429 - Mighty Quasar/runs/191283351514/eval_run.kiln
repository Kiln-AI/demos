  "output": "To convert video.webm to MP4 using the VP9 codec with constant bitrate mode, you'll need to specify the VP9 encoder, set a target bitrate, and use 2-pass encoding for optimal quality distribution.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` uses the VP9 codec for video encoding\n- `-b:v 2M` sets a constant bitrate of 2 Mbps (adjust based on your quality needs)\n- `-pass 1` and `-pass 2` enable 2-pass encoding for better bitrate control in CBR mode\n- `-c:a aac` converts audio to AAC for MP4 compatibility\n- `-f null -` on first pass discards output since we only need the log file\n\nNote: I'm assuming you want a 2 Mbps bitrate - adjust this value based on your source quality and file size requirements. VP9 in MP4 containers has limited browser support compared to H.264.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 1 -c:a aac -f null - && ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 2 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described in the <issue_description>. Although it generates a command that aims to accomplish the user's request (converting a .webm video to .mp4 using the VP9 codec), the command itself is incorrect because the second pass of the 2-pass encoding process does not specify output for the first pass and the `-pass 1` flag implies that it should create a null output, which is not compatible with the userâ€™s request for an output file in MP4 format. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output from the <failure_example> because the command does include all proper syntax elements and attempts to do what the user asked. It simply fails in its operation due to the misordering of operations regarding 2-pass encoding and the assumption in the design of the command.\n\n3) The command breaks a requirement dictated in the man page. The passing of options in FFmpeg requires careful ordering and affects the next specified output file. The command presented has the first command generating no usable file, which makes subsequent processing invalid.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output contains issues and should be marked as failing based on the requirements of proper command construction according to FFmpeg's syntax and rules."
