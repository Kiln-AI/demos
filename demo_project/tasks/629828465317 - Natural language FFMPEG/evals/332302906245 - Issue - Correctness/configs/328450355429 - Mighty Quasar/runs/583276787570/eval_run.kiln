  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To vertically stack two videos, you'll use the `concat` demuxer in FFmpeg. This involves creating a text file that lists the input files and their order, and then using the `concat demuxer` to combine them.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **`concat demuxer`**: This is the key to stacking the videos. It reads a text file that specifies the input files and their order.\n*   **Text file**: The text file lists the input files, one per line, with the format `file 'input_file'`.\n*   **Default output**: The merged video is saved to the output file specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input.txt -c copy stacked.mp4\n```\n\n**input.txt:**\n\n```\nfile 'top_video.mp4'\nfile 'bottom_video.mp4'\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n*   The input videos (`top_video.mp4` and `bottom_video.mp4`) have the same resolution and frame rate. If they don't, the stacking might look strange.\n*   The files are located in the same directory as the command, or you provide the correct path to the files in the `input.txt` file.\n*   `-safe 0` is used to allow relative paths in the input file. If you are using absolute paths, you can omit this option.\n*   `-c copy` streams the video and audio without re-encoding, which is faster and avoids quality loss. If you need to re-encode, replace `-c copy` with the appropriate video and audio codecs (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`).  If you re-encode, you might need to specify the same resolution and frame rate as the source videos.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains an issue as stated in the provided description. The user asked to stack two videos vertically, but the model incorrectly suggested using the `concat` demuxer with a text file that lists the input files, which is not required for vertical stacking. Instead, the correct approach would involve using the `hstack` filter in ffmpeg, which is intended for stacking videos (either horizontally or vertically) rather than concatenating them.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not include any obviously incorrect options like a non-existent preset; however, the logic behind the command is fundamentally flawed for the user's request.\n\n3) The command itself does not break any specific requirements outlined in the man page since it uses options that are valid in terms of ffmpeg syntax. However, it is not the correct command for the user's requirement to stack videos vertically. Therefore, while the command as written would function without error in terms of syntax and options used, it does not achieve the task specified by the user.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output fails as it did not provide a correct command to fulfill the user's request to stack videos vertically. The appropriate command should use the `-filter_complex` option with the `vstack` filter, not the `concat` demuxer. As a result, the evaluation concludes that the output does contain the issue described."
