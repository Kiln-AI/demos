  "input": "Extract a specific segment from my long video (from 5:30 to 12:45) and save it as a separate file with lossless compression.",
  "output": "To extract a segment from 5:30 to 12:45 (7 minutes and 15 seconds) and save it with lossless compression, use the `-ss` option for seeking to the start time, `-t` for specifying the duration, and encode the video using a lossless codec like `ffv1` (a lossless, open-standard codec) and the audio using a lossless codec like `flac` (Free Lossless Audio Codec). The output file is saved as an MKV container, which supports both codecs well.\n\n- `-ss 5:30` seeks to the start time (5 minutes 30 seconds) **before** the input file is read.\n- `-t 00:07:15` sets the duration to 7 minutes 15 seconds.\n- `-c:v ffv1` encodes the video with FFV1, a lossless codec that preserves all original data.\n- `-c:a flac` encodes the audio using FLAC, a lossless audio format.\n- `output.mkv` uses the Matroska container to support both lossless video and audio codecs.\n\nAssumption: The input file contains both video and audio tracks, and the user has FFV1 and FLAC codecs available (usually included with FFmpeg). If the input audio is already lossless or in a compatible format (e.g., WAV), `flac` will still encode it without quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 5:30 -i input.mp4 -t 00:07:15 -c:v ffv1 -c:a flac output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated command is accurate and matches the user's request for extracting a specific segment from the video and saving it with lossless compression.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the <failure_example>, as the command generated by the model is valid and uses correct options and parameters consistent with the ffmpeg command syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used, such as `-ss`, `-t`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`, are correctly applied, and the order of options is consistent with FFmpeg's guidelines. Additionally, both codecs mentioned (FFV1 for video and FLAC for audio) are supported in the environment described by the user.\n\n4) Since the model's output did not contain any issues, I would conclude that it passes the evaluation. The command generated is appropriate for the user's request, adheres to FFmpeg's syntax rules, and uses valid and effective codecs for lossless compression."
