    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains issues as it does not correctly map to the specified audio and video streams based on the user input. The user's request was to map the third video stream and the second audio stream, but the command generated (`-map 0 -map 2 -c:v copy -c:a:2 copy`) is incorrect. The option `-map 0` maps all streams (including the first video and audio) instead of specifying only the third video and second audio streams.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nWhile the specific command does not represent a preset failure case like `-preset extra_fast`, it does not correctly fulfill the user's request. Therefore, it can be considered a failing output because it misunderstands the stream mapping requirements.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, it breaks the requirement for accurately mapping streams. The generated command implies mapping all streams (using `-map 0`) rather than accurately mapping the third video stream and the second audio stream as specified by the user. The mapping should specify `-map 0:v:2` for the third video stream and `-map 0:a:1` for the second audio stream, rather than the incorrect `-map 0 -map 2`, which does not indicate the correct streams.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the command contains the issue described as it generates an incorrect mapping of the streams and therefore fails to meet the user's request accurately."
