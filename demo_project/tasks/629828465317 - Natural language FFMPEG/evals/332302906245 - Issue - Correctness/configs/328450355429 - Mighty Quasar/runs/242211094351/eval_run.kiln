  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To remux your input multi-track video file and map streams 6 and 9 from the input, you can use the `-map` option to specify the exact streams you want to include in the output. Since you want the 6th video stream and 9th audio stream, use `-map 0:v:5` for video and `-map 0:a:8` for audio, where `0` is the input file, `v` is video, and the number after the colon specifies the stream index (0-based).\n\nAdditionally, since you want to remux without re-encoding (stream copy), we use `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_multi_track.mp4 -map 0:v:5 -map 0:a:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will keep the video and audio streams themselves without re-encoding, just remuxing them into output.mp4 with only the specified streams mapped.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command produced is appropriate for the user's request. The command specifies the correct mapping for the video and audio streams, and it properly uses `-c copy` to indicate that streams should be copied without re-encoding. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and likely to execute successfully without errors, unlike the example output which included a non-existent preset option. The command correctly maps the specified streams from the input.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to select specific streams and applies the `-c copy` option to prevent re-encoding, which is consistent with the usage outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and is appropriate for the user request. Thus, it should be marked as a pass."
