  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "You want to extract the 5th audio stream from `input.mov` and combine it with the video stream to create a new file.  FFmpeg requires explicit mapping of streams. I'll use the stream index to specify the audio and video.\n\n- `-map 0:0` selects the first video stream (index 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:5` selects the 5th audio stream (index 5) from the input file.\n-  The output file will contain both streams, correctly matched.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:5 -c copy output.mov\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description that the generated ffmpeg command makes mistakes. The command accurately reflects the user's request to extract audio track 5 from the provided video file and combine it with the first video track. All stream mapping is clearly specified and there are no erroneous flags or commands.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced does not conflict with any known ffmpeg parameters or syntactical rules and uses appropriate and valid options (-map, -c copy) that should successfully execute to achieve the intended transformation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-map` for selecting streams is correct, and the command follows the expected order of operations, explicitly defining the input and output streams correctly.\n\n4) Since the command produced by the model is both syntactically correct and aligns with user requirements, it passes the evaluation without issue. The mapping is used appropriately, and there are no invalid parameters. Thus, it does not contain the issue referenced, confirming that the model's output is accurate."
