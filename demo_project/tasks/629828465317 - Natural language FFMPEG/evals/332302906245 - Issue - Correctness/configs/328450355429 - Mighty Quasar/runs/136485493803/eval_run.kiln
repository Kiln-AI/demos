  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To clarify, the VP9 codec (libvpx-vp9) produces video streams in the WebM or MKV container formats; browsers and players typically expect MP4 files to use H.264 (libx264) or H.265 (libx265). If you specifically need an MP4 container with a VP9 video stream, be aware that many players might not support this combination (ffmpeg will write it, some players, like VLC, may read it, but browser support is not standard).\n\nAssuming you do want a VP9 stream (libvpx-vp9) in an MP4 container, and want constant bitrate (CBR):\n\n- The FFmpeg libvpx-vp9 encoder does not have a true CBR mode, but it can approximate it using the `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` parameters all set to the target value.\n- This example uses 2M (2 megabits per second) as a target bitrate; change as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -minrate 2M -maxrate 2M -bufsize 2M -c:a libopus output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` uses the VP9 codec for video.\n- `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` all set to 2M to simulate constant bitrate (CBR).\n- `-c:a libopus` encodes audio with Opus (wide compatibility in web containers); you could use `aac` if you want an MP4-standard audio track.\n- Change `2M` to your desired bitrate.\n\n**Note:** If you truly need broad MP4 compatibility, consider using `libx264` instead.\nIf you need the output in a .webm or .mkv container, swap `.mp4` for `.webm` or `.mkv` at the end.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It correctly generates a valid `ffmpeg` command based on the user's input specifications about converting a `video.webm` file to an MP4 format with the `libvpx-vp9` codec in constant bitrate mode, while also providing an explanation of how to set these options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The command it generated is properly formed and does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options. There are no syntax errors or unsupported options in the command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It adheres to the syntax rules for `ffmpeg` commands, applies the correct options, and follows the conventions specified for setting video codecs and bitrates. \n\n4) Since the command produced by the model is valid and does not contain any errors, it passes the evaluation criteria. The command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -minrate 2M -maxrate 2M -bufsize 2M -c:a libopus output.mp4\n```\n\nThe model correctly addressed the user's request while also mentioning compatibility considerations regarding codec and container format support. Therefore, the model's output can be considered successful in this evaluation context."
