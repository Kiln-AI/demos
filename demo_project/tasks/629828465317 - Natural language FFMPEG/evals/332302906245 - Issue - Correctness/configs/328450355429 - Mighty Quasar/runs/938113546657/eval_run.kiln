  "output": "To convert video.webm to MP4 using H.264 with the \"lightning\" preset, use:\n\n- `-c:v libx264` to specify the H.264 encoder.\n- `-preset lightning` to set the encoding speed and compression balance (one of the fastest presets).\n- `-crf 23` as a secondary quality control measure for consistent visual quality.\n- `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding audio (assuming audio is compatible).\n\nThis command assumes you want to keep the original audio stream unchanged and just convert video codec only.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated aligns with the user's requirements to convert a WebM file to MP4 using the H.264 codec and the lightning preset, as there is no inherent flaw in how FFmpeg options are applied or structured in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example, as the \"lightning\" preset is a valid option for the specific codec being used (libx264). The command is correctly formed without any invalid parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used are valid, and the syntax complies with FFmpeg's rules regarding input and output specifications.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues related to the described criteria, I conclude that it passes all evaluation points."
