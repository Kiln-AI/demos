  "output": "To convert video.mov to MP4 with VP9 codec and ultra_fast preset, I'll use VP9 video encoding with the specified preset for faster encoding speed while maintaining good compatibility.\n\nVP9 is a modern codec that provides excellent compression efficiency. The ultra_fast preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency. For audio, I'll use AAC which is widely supported in MP4 containers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -preset ultra_fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Uses libvpx-vp9 for VP9 video encoding\n- Applies the ultra_fast preset for maximum encoding speed\n- Converts audio to AAC at 128kbps bitrate\n- Outputs to MP4 container format",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain the issue** described. The command generated by the model is appropriate for converting the video using the VP9 codec and the ultra_fast preset as requested by the user. It also includes the use of AAC for audio, which is a sensible choice for compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output. The command provided is well-structured and correctly utilizes existing options for both video and audio encoding. There are no unknown parameters or incorrectly named presets that would lead to failure.\n\n3) The command does **not break any requirements** dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The parameters such as `-c:v libvpx-vp9` and `-preset ultra_fast` are valid options and correctly specified for the task of encoding video. The audio setting `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` is also in line with the standard options outlined in the man page for setting the audio codec and bitrate.\n\n4) Given that the model's output follows the guidelines, uses correct parameters, and produces a valid ffmpeg command, it should **pass** the evaluation."
