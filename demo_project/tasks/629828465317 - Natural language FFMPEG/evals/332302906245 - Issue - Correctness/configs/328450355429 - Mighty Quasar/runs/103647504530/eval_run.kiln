  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": " To stabilize the shaky video 'bumpy_ride.mp4', you can use ffmpeg's time-based filter, specifically the `deshake` filter (assuming deshake is compatible with your ffmpeg build). In some cases, ffmpeg developers may provide additional filters like 'vidstabdetect', 'vidstabtransform', and 'deshake' in a plugin or written-in-C-code module. The usual technique would be to first detect motion, then compensate for it to stabilize the footage. \n\n- `vidstabdetect` analyzes the video to detect the motion between frames.\n- `vidstabtransform` uses this motion data to stabilize the video sequence.\n- `deshake` may use similar data but with potentially different stabilization logic than vidstab.\n- `-max_refs 50` allows 50 reference frames. This config is set assuming that an appropriate number of references will be enough to provide stabilization without excessive processing time.\n- `-rc_pre_filter linear` and `-spatial` parameters set the pre-filter and smoothing preference.\n- `-loop 1` redundantly sets the input file loop (usually used in looping effects, not in this context).\n\nAssuming deshake works akin to vidstab, the below command may stabilize the video based on improved stabilisation plugins.\n\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=result=temp_analysis.log,vidstabtransform=input=temp_analysis.log:zoom=1.398,deshake -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 -c:a copy output_stable.mp4\n```\n\n\nIn the above command, `deshake` is used in place of vidstab. You might need to adjust the parameters such as zoom factor or `-rc_pre_filter` value to achieve perfect results as deshake performance may vary. If deshake isn't natively supported by ffmpeg, you'd need to use an external plugin which would require additional configuration steps not covered by a standalone ffmpeg command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   Yes, the output contains a significant issue. The command generated uses both the `vidstab` filters and the `deshake` filter together, which is unnecessary and potentially incorrect. Furthermore, it suggests that `deshake` can be used in conjunction with `vidstab`, which is likely not true as these are different stabilization techniques and could conflict. The command should either utilize the `deshake` filter alone or the `vidstab` filters alone. The output did not adhere to the user's request clearly to use `deshake`.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, it bears similarity in that the output contains redundant and likely incorrect commands that the user did not request. The command includes parameters that may not be valid together, akin to how a non-existent preset might lead to failure.\n\n3) **Here does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not directly break any specific syntax rules of the ffmpeg man page, but it does create confusion by combining two different stabilization methods inappropriately without clarifying which is ultimately being executed. This poor command construction could lead to operational failure or unexpected results, reflecting improper use of ffmpeg capabilities.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command is not appropriate for the user's requirement of using only the `deshake` filter for stabilization. The inclusion of the `vidstab` filters and their parameters adds unnecessary complexity and conflicting techniques, thus failing to meet the original request accurately."
