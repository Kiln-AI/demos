  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To set specific high bitrates for both video (100,000 kbps) and audio (512 kbps), specify them with the `-b:v` (video bitrate) and `-b:a` (audio bitrate) options. This will ensure the output video and audio streams use the requested bitrates.\n\nAssuming you want to use H.264 for video and AAC for audio (common choices), hereâ€™s how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -b:v 100000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-b:v 100000k` sets the video bitrate to 100,000 kbps (very high, for near-lossless quality).\n- `-b:a 512k` sets audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` select H.264 and AAC codecs.\n\n**Note:** Such a high video bitrate results in very large files; make sure your storage and target devices can handle this bitrate. Some formats or devices may have limits on playable bitrate.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated by the model is valid and conforms to the user's request for setting a specific high bitrate for both video and audio. The options used are appropriate according to the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is correct, does not contain any invalid options or syntax, and does not include any nonexistent presets or directives.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options `-b:v` and `-b:a` for setting the video and audio bitrates are correctly used, and the specified values are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model correctly addresses the user's input without introducing any errors or unsupported options, it passes the evaluation. The model's output is accurate and follows the requirements set forth by the user."
