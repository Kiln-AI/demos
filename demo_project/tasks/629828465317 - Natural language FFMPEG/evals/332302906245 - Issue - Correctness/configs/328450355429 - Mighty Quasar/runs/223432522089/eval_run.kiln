  "output": "You want to apply a series of video filters to adjust brightness, contrast, and reduce noise. The `-vf` option allows you to specify a filter chain. The provided filter chain uses `eq` for brightness and contrast adjustments, and `hqdn3d` for noise reduction. The parameters for `hqdn3d` control the strength of the noise reduction.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5\" output.mp4\n```\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command logically follows the user's request to apply a series of video filters for color correction and noise reduction. It clearly specifies the use of the provided filter chain with the appropriate `-vf` option, following the correct syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model uses valid parameters and options correctly, unlike the failing example which uses an invalid preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, the options are relevant to the task at hand, and it correctly identifies and implements the specified filters.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus it should pass. The command is valid, matches the user's requirements, and adheres to FFmpeg syntax and semantics."
