  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract the video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 in `broadcast.ts` and combine them into a single output file, you can use `-map` to specify exact input streams. Setting the video stream index to 0 defaults the input to the first video stream, but since you want stream 10, explicitly set `-map 0:v:10` to select the 10th video stream. For audio, use `-map 0:a:18` to get audio stream 18. However, a safe and clear way is to use `-map 0:v:n` or `-map 0:a:m` instead, where `n` is the stream index you want. So, use `-map 0:v:10` for the video and `-map 0:a:18` for the audio for explicit selection.\n\nIf you want to assign video and audio by stream by name instead (which is useful if stream IDs might change or the number of streams is unknown), the best practice is to use `-map 0:v:stream_id` or `-map 0:a:stream_id` but since indexing is strict, using stream indexes works better for guaranteed results.\n\nSince `broadcast.ts` might contain multiple audio streams or the video stream index is unknown, a safer command is:\n\n- `-map 0:v:10` selects the 10th video stream explicitly.\n- `-map 0:a:18` intentionally selects stream 18 as audio if it exists.\n- This command will fail if stream 18 does not exist, so it’s good practice to first check stream existence before creating the output (e.g., with `ffprobe`).\n\nExample command with explicit stream mapping:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg - i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 output_video_audio.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to handle unknown stream existence safely, parse the inputs first to ensure stream 18 exists, and adjust the command accordingly.\n\nNote: If you want to merge video and audio into a single output file container (like MKV or WebM), FFmpeg's `-c copy` will stream copy without re-encoding, preserving quality but only suitable for compatible containers (MKV for many streams, WebM with codecs like VP9/Aac for video and audio). But be careful that not all containers support all stream types.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- `-map 0:v:10` — selects the 10th video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:18` — selects the 18th audio stream (if exists).\n- Output container is assumed as .mp4 because specification was requested.\n\nIf you have multiple audio streams other than stream 18, you must specify which audio stream you want or burn them into a single stream. If none of your audio streams are numbered 18, select the first audio stream or programmatically handle as needed.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 output_video_audio.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description: the command it generated has a syntax error. The command includes an erroneous space in `- i` instead of `-i`, which would cause the command to fail. Thus, it does not work correctly as per the user's requirements.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example given. The failure example involves an invalid option (`-preset extra_fast`), while the model's error is related to incorrect syntax (a space in `- i`). However, both outputs would fail to execute properly.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any core requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page; however, since it contains the syntax error (the extra space), it would not work as intended. Thus, while the usage of `-map` for selecting individual streams is correct, the incorrect syntax would prevent the command from executing.\n\nBased on the evaluation, since the model's output contains the error (the space in `- i`), the final answer is:\n\n**FAIL**. The model's output contained an issue with the ffmpeg command syntax, preventing it from executing correctly."
