  "output": "To extract the audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you can use the `-vn` flag to disable video recording and the `-compression_level` option for the FLAC encoder to set the compression. The maximum compression level for FLAC is usually 12.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nThis command takes the input video, disables video output, encodes the audio stream as FLAC with maximum compression, and saves it as output.flac.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is syntactically correct, follows the requirements given by the user, and uses appropriate `ffmpeg` options to extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with the specified maximum compression level.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command it generated is valid and does not reference any non-existent preset like `extra_fast`. It correctly utilizes `-vn`, `-c:a flac`, and `-compression_level 12`, which is valid according to `ffmpeg` standards.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options used are appropriate for the task, and the command follows the correct syntax without any issues.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it passes this evaluation."
