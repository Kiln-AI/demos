  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract and combine specific video and audio streams from a transport stream (`broadcast.ts`), we use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg` to select the desired streams by their index. For clarity, `ffmpeg` often lists all streams in the input with their indices.\n\n- `-map 0:v:10` maps the 11th video stream (index 10) from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:18` maps the 19th audio stream (index 18) from the input.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the video and audio codecs without re-encoding (faster and preserves quality).\n- We assume you want to copy both streams for preservation of original encoding (if re-encoding is needed, avcodec, bitrate, etc. settings could be adjusted).\n- We assume the output format is MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command effectively extracts the specified video and audio streams from the input file and combines them into the desired output format without any apparent syntax or logical errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model correctly uses options that exist and makes valid assumptions about copying the streams. It does not reference any non-existent presets, options, or codecs.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` options to select the streams based on their indices, and the copy codec options `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` are appropriate for preserving the original audio and video streams' encoding without re-encoding.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation steps, the model's output passes since it generates a correct, functional command that does not have any issues according to the criteria provided."
