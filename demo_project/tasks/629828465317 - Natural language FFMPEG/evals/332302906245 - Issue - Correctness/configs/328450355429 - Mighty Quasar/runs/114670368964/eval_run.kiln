  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from the input file, you'll need to identify their unique stream indices.\n\nHere's how you could go about that:\n\n1. **Check the media type**: ffmpeg returns a `-maps` option indicating which streams should be used. Run `ffmpeg -i complex.avi -v stats 2>&1 | grep -i \"stream index\"` to see the stream indices, even if `ffmpeg` is silent with `-stats 2>&1`. You will know how many streams are in the file.\n\n2. **Identify the stream numbers**: After knowing the media type, use the command: `ffmpeg -i complex.avi -v raw -an 2>&1 | grep -A3 \"stream number\"`. Adjust the `-an` switch according to your needs.\n\nHere is how you would map the second (-1) and fourth (-3) video streams, and the fourth (-4) audio stream:\n\nThe first video is at stream 0, the first audio is at stream 1, the second video is at stream -1, the first audio in duplicate, the second audio is at stream -2, the second video is at stream -2, and the second audio is at stream -3 with the third is 1(1st audio as first one is removed). \nThis approach produces duplicate audio streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -vf scale=-2:720,-map 1 (-map 2),-map 2 (-map_to 2:0.0,-map_to 3:1.0),-c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n**Parameters breakdown**:\n\n1. `-map 1` maps the first (-1) video stream.\n2. `-map 2` maps the second (-2) video stream. It is also a same number as 2nd Map.\n3. `-map 2 (-map_to 2:0.0,-map_to 3:1.0)` maps the second (-2) video stream to stream 0 and 1 respectively.\n \nRemember, you can find the names (`Stream #0:0 (libx264)`) (output of `ffmpeg -i complex.avi` to identify the output name)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues as it attempts to map video and audio streams incorrectly. The mapping syntax used in the provided command is ambiguous and does not follow standard FFmpeg syntax, which can lead to incorrect execution of the command.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided, as it does contain some attempt at forming a valid command. However, it’s still incorrectly structured and misleading, constituting a failure in effectiveness.\n\n3) The command does break the requirements dictated in the man page because:\n   - The mapping of streams using `-map` is improperly formatted and contradicts FFmpeg’s expected input syntax. For instance, using `(-map 1 (-map 2)` and `(-map_to 2:0.0,-map_to 3:1.0)` is incorrect and not a valid construction for mapping streams in FFmpeg.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does indeed contain the issue described. Therefore, it should be marked as a failure due to incorrect mapping syntax and potential confusion around stream indexing."
