  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvpx (VP9) codec with 2-pass encoding, youâ€™ll first run a 1st pass to collect statistics, and then use these stats in the 2nd pass to achieve optimal quality and bitrate control. \n\nHere's how to do it:\n\n**First Pass:**\n\n- Use -pass 1 to instruct ffmpeg to only generate statistics for later use.\n- -b:v will set the average bitrate, but in pass 1, ffmpeg ignores it for most codecs.\n- -threads auto and -deadline good are typical VP9 settings for encoding efficiency.\n- Output filename must be AVI with .avi extension.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -threads auto -deadline good -pass 1 output.avi\n```\n\n**Second Pass:**\n\n- Use the same codec settings as in the first pass, but add -pass 2.\n- -b:v now controls the target bitrate for VP9. Choose a bitrate appropriate for your video resolution and quality requirements.\n- -threads auto and -deadline good work best again.\n- Include audio (e.g., Vorbis as AVI best practice).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -threads auto -deadline good -pass 2 -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.avi\n```\n\n**Assumption:**  \n- You want an average video bitrate of 2 Mbps (change 2M in the second command to your desired value).\n- Audio is set to Vorbis for AVI compatibility; you can choose another supported codec if needed.\n- Two passes improve bitrate control and perceptual quality, especially for codecs like VP9.\n- By default, `libvpx-vp9` produces WebM. AVI is used as the container for compatibility, though it's less commonly used with VP9 than WebM.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description. The command it provided will not execute correctly because `libvp9` does not exist; it should be `libvpx-vp9`. Hence, the command generates an error something like \"Unknown encoder 'libvp9'\".\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example because the command contains plausible components, but it does have a critical error regarding the codec used. The command will fail, but it's not directly similar to the example provided.\n\n3) The command does not directly break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`, other than the incorrect codec name. The structure of the command otherwise follows `ffmpeg` conventions and syntax correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluation, the model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description, specifically regarding the incorrect codec name. Therefore it must be marked as a failure."
