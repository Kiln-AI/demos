  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your video to H.265 (HEVC) format using the `veryfast2` preset for better compression, you'll need to specify the codec, the preset, and adjust the compression settings accordingly. The `veryfast2` preset is not a standard name for `ffmpeg`, so I'll assume you meant the `veryfast` preset, which is a faster encoding option that still provides reasonable compression efficiency.\n\n- `-c:v hevc` selects the H.265/HEVC video codec.\n- `-preset veryfast` uses the veryfast encoding preset for faster processing.\n- `-crf 28` sets the Constant Rate Factor for quality control (lower values mean better quality; 28 is a good balance for compression).\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional but helps with streaming by placing metadata at the beginning of the file.\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio codec, which is widely supported.\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v hevc -preset veryfast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.hevc\n```\n\n**Note**: Make sure your system supports H.265 encoding (you may need to install additional libraries like `libx265`). Also, ensure that the input file is compatible with the codecs you're using.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue related to the encoding preset. The model claims that the user specified \"veryfast2,\" which is not a valid preset name in ffmpeg. Instead, it assumed the more commonly used \"veryfast\" preset. This could lead to confusion or errors if  the user intended a different preset.\n\n2) The command output does not match the \"extra_fast\" issue from the failure example since \"veryfast\" is a valid preset. However, the model did misinterpret the user's input by correcting \"veryfast2\" to \"veryfast,\" which, while correct in one sense, is still a significant deviation from the user's original intent.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. The syntax and parameters used in the output are all valid for the conversion task specified.\n\n4) The model's output fails to fully comply with the user's request due to the incorrect assumption about the preset name. Therefore, it contains the described issue and ultimately fails the evaluation criteria since it does not generate a correct command that matches the user's explicit request."
