  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To compress `movie.mkv` quickly using the \"turbo\" preset (assumed to mean `ultrafast`), you'll re-encode the video with H.264 and audio with AAC. The `ultrafast` preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, and adjusting CRF (Constant Rate Factor) and audio bitrate further reduces file size.\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses H.264 video codec for efficient compression.\n- `-preset ultrafast`: Enables the fastest encoding speed (assumed for \"turbo\").\n- `-crf 28`: Reduces video quality slightly to shrink file size (higher CRF = smaller file).\n- `-c:a aac`: Encodes audio with AAC, which balances quality and size.\n- `-b:a 128k`: Sets audio bitrate to 128 kbps for smaller file size.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n``` \n\n**Note:** This converts the file to MP4 (a more common container for compressed media). If you want to keep MKV, replace `output.mp4` with `output.mkv` and omit `-c:a aac` (retains original audio codec).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated is valid and properly aligns with the user request to compress the `movie.mkv` file. The use of the `-preset ultrafast` option is appropriate for quick compression.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not include any non-existent options; it uses valid options according to the FFmpeg documentation. So there is no evident failure in the syntax used in the command.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All the parameters used in the command are valid based on the provided man page information.\n\n4) Since the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, does not resemble a known failure, and adheres to the man page requirements, it can be assessed as a correct and functional output for the user's request. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation."
