  "input": "Convert my video using a bitrate of 25000k for video and 320k for audio to balance quality and size.",
  "output": "To convert your video using a video bitrate of 25,000 kbps and an audio bitrate of 320 kbps, the following command applies explicit bitrate settings for both video and audio streams. This allows for a balance between quality and file size, optimized for high definition output.\n\n- `b:v 25000k` sets the video bitrate to 25,000 kbps (25 Mbps).\n- `b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- We use the default `libx264` encoder for video and `aac` for audio, as they offer good quality and wide compatibility.\n- The container format will be MP4 by default when outputting `.mp4`.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Source is a video file (e.g., `input.mp4`).\n- You want a high-quality output suitable for media players and possibly for streaming if needed.\n- The resolution and frame rate are unchanged by default; if you need scaling or resizing, let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 25000k -b:a 320k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is valid and correctly implements the user request for specific bitrates for both the video and audio streams. The output command should work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is correctly structured and does not contain any nonexistent parameters like the \"extra_fast\" preset. Instead, it uses valid settings for bitrate.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used align well with the expected usage and the syntax is correct. It specifies both the input file, the desired bitrates for video and audio, and assumes the MP4 output which is a valid format. The assumptions stated by the model, such as the source being a video file and the intention for high-quality output, are also reasonable given the context.\n\n4) Since the output does not contain any identifiable issues, it should pass this evaluation. The model successfully generated a command that meets the user's requirements without errors."
