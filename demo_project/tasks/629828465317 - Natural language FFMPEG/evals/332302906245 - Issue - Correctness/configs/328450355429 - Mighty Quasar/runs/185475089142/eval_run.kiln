  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific sequence in ffmpeg, you use a chain of filters linked with a comma. The order matters because each filter processes the output of the previous one. \n\nA typical approach is:\n\n1. Temporal noise reduction (e.g., using the `hqdn3d` filter, which is a good one for simple 3D denoising).\n2. Spatial denoising (e.g., using `nlmeans` or a strong spatial denoiser like `hqdn3d`'s spatial components or `gradfun`).\n3. Edge enhancement (e.g., sharpening filters like `unsharp`).\n\nHereâ€™s an example chain where:\n- Temporal noise reduction is done first (`hqdn3d`),\n- Then spatial denoising using the same filter with second and third parameters reduced for spatial filtering,\n- Followed by a mild unsharp mask for edge enhancement.\n\nThe common syntax uses `-vf` or `-filter_complex`. For simplicity, I will use `-vf` assuming single input.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=4.0:3.0:6.0:4.5,unsharp=7:7:1.0:7:7:0.0\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `hqdn3d=4.0:3.0:6.0:4.5` applies spatial-temporal denoising:\n  - `4.0:3.0` is temporal luma spatial strength (high for noise),\n  - `6.0:4.5` is chroma, slightly less aggressive.\n- `unsharp=7:7:1.0:7:7:0.0` applies a strong but controlled edge/unsharp sharpening.\n  - `7:7:1.0` luma radius=7, bv=7, amount=1.0\n  - `7:7:0.0` chroma radius and amount set for moderate color sharpening.\n\nAdjust parameters as unions corrected for your input quality and desired effect.\n\nThis chain first reduces temporal and spatial noise, then enhances edges without over-sharpening.\n\nIf your requirements specify different filters or filters with different order or parameters, modify these accordingly. Using `-filter_complex` allows chaining multiple independent filterchains and mixing outputs if needed, but for straightforward ordering, `-vf` is convenient.\n\nIf you want max control with multiple filter inputs and outputs, let me know. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=4.0:3.0:6.0:4.5,unsharp=7:7:1.0:7:7:0.0\" output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not have any obvious issues in generating the ffmpeg command. The command provided appears to be syntactically correct and uses appropriate filters. The command uses `hqdn3d` for temporal denoising and includes `unsharp` for edge enhancement, which are legitimate filter options in ffmpeg. Therefore, it does not violate the requirements specified.\n\n**Verdict: Pass**\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nThe output produced by the model is not similar to the failing example provided. The example failure involves the use of a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), while the output here correctly references valid filters and parameters in ffmpeg. Thus, the case presented does not demonstrate similar failing behavior.\n\n**Verdict: Pass**\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used `hqdn3d` and `unsharp` adhere to the syntax and usage rules for filters. The provided command does not present any illegal options or arrangements that would be in conflict with the specifications of the man page.\n\n**Verdict: Pass**\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nGiven that the model's output does not contain any issues and correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command that aligns with the user's request, the conclusion is that it passes all evaluation criteria. \n\n**Final Verdict: Pass**"
