  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To add hardcoded subtitles to the movie, you can use `srt` muxing with ffmpeg. Here's how you can do it:\n\n\n```markdown\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitles=srt://subtitles.srt,subtitle_color=yellow,drawtext=fontsize=24:align=0x1:color=yellow output.mkv\n```\n\nIn this command:\n\n- The `subtitles` filter is used to load `subtitles.srt` subtitle file.\n- The `subtitle_color=yellow` filter sets the text color to yellow.\n- The `drawtext` filter adds the subtitle text at the top left of the output video (aligned with Y=0). You can view the value `0x1` in Google for other alignment options.\n- Replace `output.mkv` with the desired output filename.\n- We didn't specify volume or other audio settings since subtitles don't make loud noise. For example, you would get a louder volume output if you had an external volume control or a separate source of audio playback.\n\nPlease note that the first line is the explanation while -vf and -drawtext provide detailed instructions to add desired features.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue as described in the issue description. The command generated attempts to combine the `subtitles` filter with an incorrect syntax by adding multiple filters in an inappropriate way. It tries to use `subtitle_color=yellow` in a way that is not valid in the context of the `subtitles` filter, and `drawtext` is incorrectly applied in this context. The command would likely fail to execute or produce an error.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided, as the command does use a valid input and output structure, albeit incorrectly formatted and containing syntax issues. Hence, it does not fall under the same category of failure as the example given.\n\n3) The command breaks multiple requirements dictated in the man page. The use of the `-vf` flag in the command `ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitles=srt://subtitles.srt,subtitle_color=yellow,drawtext=fontsize=24:align=0x1:color=yellow output.mkv` contains an incorrect use of the filter since the correct way to specify subtitle color within the `subtitles` option is not as a separate parameter but rather as part of the filter's argument itself.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output fails the task because it fails to generate a command that works correctly as required by the user input. Therefore, it does contain the discussed issue. \n\nFinal Evaluation: **Fail**."
