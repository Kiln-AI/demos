  "output": "To map specific streams from source.mkv, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5, then encode them into a new MP4 file.\n\nThe `-map` parameter allows you to select specific streams from the input file:\n- `-map 0:3` selects the 4th stream (video) from the first input file (streams are 0-indexed)\n- `-map 0:5` selects the 6th stream (audio) from the first input file\n- `-c:v libx264` re-encodes video using H.264 codec for MP4 compatibility\n- `-c:a aac` re-encodes audio using AAC codec for MP4 compatibility\n- I'm assuming you want to re-encode the streams; if you want to copy them without re-encoding, you could use `-c copy` instead\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac edited.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to copy the streams without re-encoding (faster but requires compatible codecs):\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain an issue as described: it generated a command that accurately reflects the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from `source.mkv` to create `edited.mp4`. The use of `-map` for selecting the appropriate streams and the encoding with compatible codecs is correct and appropriate.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided: it does not contain an invalid option or command (like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist). The options used in the generated command are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options used are valid, and the command follows the necessary syntax for stream selection, which is described correctly in the documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output should pass the evaluation, as it meets the user's request accurately and does not include errors in the FFmpeg command constructs."
