  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution, you need to use the `select` filter to pick frames at regular intervals and set the resolution to the maximum supported by your hardware or software.\n\nAssume that \"ultra high resolution\" means a very high resolution such as 4K (3840x2160). Note that extracting from a full 4K video might be resource-intensive.\n\nHere’s the command to achieve this:\n\n- `-vf select=\"not(mod(n\\,20))\"`: Extracts one frame for every 2 seconds (`n` is the frame number, `20` corresponds to a frame rate of 10fps, which is about 0.2 seconds per frame).\n- `-s 3840x2160`: Set the resolution to 4K (you can adjust this to the highest resolution your system can handle).\n- `-vsync vfr`: Ensures variable frame synchronization which is necessary when selecting non-sequential frames.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"select='not(mod(n\\,20))',scale=3840:2160\" -vsync vfr -y percent-04d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `percent-04d.png` will generate filenames like `0001.png`, `0002.png`, etc. This assumes you have write permissions to the current directory. If not, specify a different output directory.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated `ffmpeg` command properly addresses the user’s requirement to extract frames from a video every 2 seconds, specifying the use of a valid filter (`select`) and resolutions. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output in <failure_example>. The command generated does not reference any invalid or non-existent options; it effectively uses available `ffmpeg` options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses valid syntax and options such as `-vf` for video filters including the `select` filter and resizing with the `scale` option, both of which are documented and correctly implemented.\n\n4) Since the command does not contain the issue described, does not mirror the failing output example, and adheres to requirements from the man page, it passes evaluation. The command is correctly formed and matches the requirements from the user."
