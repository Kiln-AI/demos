  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your video to H.265 (HEVC) format with the veryfast2 preset, you'll use the libx265 encoder. H.265 provides better compression efficiency than H.264, meaning smaller file sizes at similar quality levels.\n\nKey parameters:\n- `c:v libx265` uses the H.265/HEVC video encoder\n- `preset veryfast2` prioritizes encoding speed while maintaining reasonable compression (faster than \"fast\" but not as fast as \"ultrafast\")\n- `crf 28` sets quality level (I'm assuming you want good quality; lower values = better quality but larger files)\n- `c:a copy` copies the original audio without re-encoding (assuming the audio codec is compatible)\n\nI'm assuming your input file has compatible audio that doesn't need re-encoding. If you need audio conversion, replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to specify a different quality level, adjust the CRF value (18-28 is typically good for H.265, with 23-28 being common choices).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model does not contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command it generated is valid and uses the correct syntax and options for converting a video to H.265 format with the specified preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is syntactically correct and utilizes valid parameters (`libx265`, `veryfast2`, etc.). No non-existent preset or codec is mentioned.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. Every option used is valid according to the provided documentation, and the general structure adheres to the guidelines for encoding videos.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; it successfully provides a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements without any errors. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
