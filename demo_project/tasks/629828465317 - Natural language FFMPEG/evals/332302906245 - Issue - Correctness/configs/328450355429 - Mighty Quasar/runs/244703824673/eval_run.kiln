  "input": "Can you set the bitrate to 100M for maximum quality when converting to MP4?",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 100 Mbps (100M) for maximum quality when converting to MP4, use the H.264 codec (`libx264`). This ensures high-quality video while maintaining compatibility with MP4 containers. The audio is encoded using AAC at a default rate (typically 128 kbps), which is sufficient for most use cases. If you want to ensure audio quality matches the video, you can adjust the audio bitrate accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 video codec, widely supported for MP4 files.\n- `-b:v 100M` sets the video bitrate to 100 Mbps, prioritizing quality over file size.\n- Audio is left as default (AAC at 128 kbps unless overridden), as the user did not specify adjustments. For maximum quality, consider adding `-c:a aac -b:a 384k` if higher audio fidelity is desired.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the `<issue_description>`. The ffmpeg command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M output.mp4`) is correctly formatted and matches the requirement of setting the video bitrate to 100 Mbps for maximum quality. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the `<failure_example>`. The command provided does not contain any syntax errors or invalid options. It adheres to the required specifications of the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-c:v libx264` for codec selection and `-b:v 100M` for bitrate setting) are valid and align with the documented ffmpeg usage.\n\n4) Given that the output is correct, error-free, and consistent with user requirements and ffmpeg documentation, the model's output should pass the evaluation."
