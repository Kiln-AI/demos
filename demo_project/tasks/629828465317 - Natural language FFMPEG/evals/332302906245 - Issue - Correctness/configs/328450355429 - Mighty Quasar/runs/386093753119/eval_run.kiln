  "input": "I need to apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence to clean up an old video file.",
  "output": "To restore an old video by applying noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening in sequence, we'll use a combination of FFmpeg filters with appropriate parameters. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- `hqdn3d=0:0:6:6`: Reduces noise spatially and temporally (parameters are strength and smooth for spatial/temporal reduction). Lower values (e.g., 0 for luminance) preserve fine details.\n- `eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5`: Adjusts brightness (0.1 to lighten), contrast (1.2 to increase), and saturation (1.5 to enhance colors). Modify these values based on the original video's characteristics.\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0:3:3`: Applies sharpening with a 5×5 kernel for luminance (1.0 strength) and 3×3 for chrominance. Adjust `1.0` values for stronger or gentler sharpening.\n\nThis pipeline ensures noise is reduced first (to avoid amplifying noise during sharpening), followed by color correction, and finally sharpening to enhance clarity.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]hqdn3d=0:0:6:6,eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5,unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0:3:3\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nKey assumptions:\n1. You want H.264 video and original audio (if present) for broad compatibility.\n2. The audio codec is unchanged (adjusted via `-c:a copy` if no changes are needed).\n3. Pixel format `yuv420p` ensures compatibility with embedded players.\n4. Parameters (`brightness=0.1`, `unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0:3:3`) are example values that may need adjustment for your specific source material.\n\nFor audio noise reduction (if desired), add `pan=stereo` with `highpass` or `lowpass` filters in the audio chain.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command with appropriate filters for noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening, according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any invalid options or parameters. It uses valid filter names and options, which aligns with the `ffmpeg` command syntax as outlined in the man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All specified filters and parameters are valid and correctly formatted. The ordering of the filters and options is appropriate, and there are no conflicting options.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is correct and does not contain any of the issues described in the evaluation steps."
