  "output": "To convert `file.mp4` to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the `veryslow` preset, you'll want to use `libvpx` (the VP8 encoder) and `libvorbis` for audio (popular and widely compatible in WebM). The `-cpu-used` parameter controls encoding speed for VP8: `-cpu-used 0` is the slowest/best quality (closest to \"veryslow\"). WebM doesn't support preset names like H.264, so this is the equivalent.\n\nAssumption: You want good visual quality at a reasonable bitrate suitable for WebM.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -cpu-used 0 -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\n\n- `-c:v libvpx` sets VP8 video encoding.\n- `-b:v 1M` sets video bitrate to 1 Mbps (adjust for higher/lower quality as needed).\n- `-cpu-used 0` gives you the best quality (slowest encoding; like \"veryslow\").\n- `-c:a libvorbis` uses the recommended Vorbis audio codec for WebM.\n\nYou can also add additional quality controls like `-qmin 0 -qmax 50` if you wish to further tweak the quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues related to command correctness. The command generated is appropriate for converting `file.mp4` to WebM format using the VP8 codec and appropriately employs the -cpu-used 0 parameter to mimic the \"veryslow\" preset effect. \n\n2) The output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The generated command is valid and does not include any erroneous preset names like `extra_fast`. \n\n3) The command issued by the model does not break any requirements from the man page for FFmpeg. The options provided (`-c:v libvpx`, `-b:v 1M`, `-cpu-used 0`, and `-c:a libvorbis`) are appropriate and adhere to the command structure outlined in the man page. \n\n4) Given that the command produced by the model is valid, matches the user's requirements, and adheres to the guidelines set forth in the man page, the model's output should pass the evaluation."
