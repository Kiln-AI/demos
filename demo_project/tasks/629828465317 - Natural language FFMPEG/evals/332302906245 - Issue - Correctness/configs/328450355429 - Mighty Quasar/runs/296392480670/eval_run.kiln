  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To extract video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from a file with multiple streams (e.g., recording.mkv), you can use the `-map` option to specify exactly which streams to copy. This avoids unnecessary re-encoding (which is desirable for stream selection) and produces an output with only those selected streams.\n\n- `-map 0:v:12` selects video stream 12 from the first input (`0:v:12`).\n- `-map 0:a:25` selects audio stream 25 from the first input (`0:a:25`).\n- `-c copy` will copy streams without re-encoding them, maintaining original quality and speed.\n- Adjust the input filename and output container as per your needs. This example assumes output for playback.\n\nHereâ€™s how to do this with ffmpeg:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command efficiently creates a new file containing only video stream 12 and audio stream 25.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any mistakes in the ffmpeg command it generates. The command generated is correctly formatted to select specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream file, which matches the user's requirements. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any invalid options like the non-existent preset `extra_fast`. Instead, it uses valid and appropriate options to achieve the user's request.\n\n3) Review of the command against the man page for ffmpeg shows that it adheres to all requirements. The options used are valid and correctly applied: `-map` is used for stream selection without any re-encoding, and `-c copy` indicates that streams should be copied. According to the man page, the syntax and order of the options are correct, and there are no conflicts with the command syntax.\n\n4) Since there is no mistake in the command or deviation from the requirements outlined in the man page, the output passes the evaluation criteria."
