  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress your `video.mov` file using the `ultrafast` preset (often referred to as \"hyper\" or the fastest possible encoding speed), you can use the `libx264` video codec with the `-preset ultrafast` option. This preset sacrifices compression efficiency for maximum speed, reducing encoding time while increasing file size.\n\n- `-preset ultrafast` ensures the fastest possible encoding speed.\n- `-crf 23` sets a default quality value for constant quality encoding (you can adjust this value: lower = better quality).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding, assuming it is compatible (e.g., AAC).\n- If your input uses a less common pixel format, we assume it's safe to convert to `yuv420p` for wide compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nIf your audio is not in a compatible format (e.g., it's in ALAC or another codec not supported in MP4), you may need to re-encode it, for example using `-c:a aac`. Let me know if you need such a version.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command is valid, correctly applies the `ultrafast` preset, and the parameters align with the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command `ffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast ...` is correct and uses a valid preset (`ultrafast`), which does exist in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The usage of options such as `-i`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, and `-crf` follows the guidelines specified, ensuring the command respects the expected syntax and functionality.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described; it follows all the appropriate guidelines and generates a valid command. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
