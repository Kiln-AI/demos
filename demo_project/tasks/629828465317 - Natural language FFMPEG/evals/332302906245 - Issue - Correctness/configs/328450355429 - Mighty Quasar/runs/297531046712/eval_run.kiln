  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge multiple MP4 files seamlessly, the best method is to use the concat demuxer, which requires the files to have the same codec, codec parameters, and container format. This approach is faster since it just joins the files without re-encoding.\n\nSteps:\n1. Create a text file (e.g., inputs.txt) listing the files in order:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\n2. Use the concat demuxer to merge without re-encoding.\n\nAssumption: Your input files have the same codec, format, and encoding parameters so they can be concatenated directly.\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-f concat` uses the concat demuxer.\n- `-safe 0` allows unsafe file paths.\n- `-i inputs.txt` is the input list.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n- `output.mp4` is the merged continuous video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is correct for merging three video files into one continuous video file using the concat demuxer, following the correct method without introducing errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is accurate, and all parameters specified are valid for the merging operation. There are no invalid presets or incorrect flags used.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid options for utilizing the concat demuxer and appropriately handles file concatenation without re-encoding. There are no violations of the order requirements, argument specifications, or invalid options.\n\n4) Given the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass."
