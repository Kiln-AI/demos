    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command generated is valid and correctly matches the requirements specified by the user, mapping the third video stream (`0:v:2`) and the second audio stream (`0:a:1`) from the input file `multi.avi` to the output file `final.mp4`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4`) is syntactically correct and does not reference any non-existent options or incorrect command usage like the `extra_fast` preset in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. It correctly follows the syntax and structure for mapping specific input streams to output streams and uses the option `-c copy`, which is appropriate for copying codec data without re-encoding.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain any issues and is valid based on the user's request and the ffmpeg man page guidelines. The command generated by the model fulfills the task requirements correctly. The evaluation is a pass."
