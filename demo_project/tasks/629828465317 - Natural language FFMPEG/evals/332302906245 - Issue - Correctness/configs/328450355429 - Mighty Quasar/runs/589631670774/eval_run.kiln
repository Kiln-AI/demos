  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the second video stream (index 0:1) and the fourth audio track (index 0:3) from input.avi and save as result.mp4, use the -map option. -map 0:1 picks the second video stream and -map 0:3 picks the fourth audio stream. By default, FFmpeg keeps all streams unless specified otherwise.\n\nNote: Stream indices start at 0, so stream 0:1 is the second video stream and stream 0:3 is the fourth audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```\n\nThis command copies the streams directly without re-encoding (-c copy), which is efficient for MP4 and should work if the streams are compatible. If you encounter compatibility issues, you may need to re-encode as a workaround, e.g., with -c:v libx264 -c:a aac. But using -c copy is recommended unless needed otherwise.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly extracts specific streams from the input file without any evident mistakes. It uses the appropriate -map options as requested in the user's input, and the command appears to conform to the FFmpeg syntax and semantics.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example contains a command with an incorrect preset which does not exist (`-preset extra_fast`). In contrast, the command generated by the model (`-map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4`) is valid and does not include any incorrect options.\n\n3) The command given by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used (`-map`, `-c copy`) are valid, and the command structure follows the synopsis outlined in the documentation. There are no conflicting or erroneous options present, and the usage adheres to the established guidelines for stream mapping and copying data.\n\n4) Given that the model's output does not contain the issue described, is not similar to a failing output, and does not break any requirements from the man page, it can be concluded that the model performed well on this task. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
