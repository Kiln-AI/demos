  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the original video while using only the third audio stream from the input, use stream mapping (`-map`). The video stream is index 0, and the third audio stream is index 2 (0-based indexing).\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from input file 0\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third (index 2) audio stream from input file 0\n- `-c copy` performs stream copy (no encoding/decoding) to maintain original quality\n- Since there's no container conversion (both source and output are Matroska), simply copy the streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command correctly maps the original video stream and selects the third audio stream from the input file, while maintaining the original quality through the use of `-c copy`. The command should work correctly based on the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain an invalid option or a non-existent preset, and adheres to the requirements from the user. Thus, it does not exhibit characteristics of a failing output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses the correct format for stream mapping, maintains the appropriate order of arguments, and utilizes valid options for copying the streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Since the command correctly implements all aspects of the task as described and adheres to ffmpeg's requirements without generating errors or invalid commands, it should be evaluated as passing. Therefore, the model's output is appropriate and fulfills the user's request without issues."
