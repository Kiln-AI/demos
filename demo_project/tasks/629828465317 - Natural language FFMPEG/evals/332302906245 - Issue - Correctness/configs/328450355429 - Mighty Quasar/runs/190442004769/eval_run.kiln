  "output": "To transcode input.mp4 to an AVI file using the VP9 codec with 2-pass encoding:\n\n- The VP9 codec is typically used within WebM or Matroska (MKV) containers, but FFmpeg can create AVI files with VP9 video. However, compatibility with AVI players may not be guaranteed, as AVI is not a standard container for VP9. This command will work, but for maximum compatibility, consider using MKV instead.\n- For 2-pass encoding, you run FFmpeg twice: the first pass collects stats, the second pass does the actual encoding using the stats.\n- Audio is omitted in the first pass (null output), and encoded in the second (here using libopus within AVI, which also is nonstandard, so you could use pcm_s16le for strict AVI compatibility).\n\nHere are the commands:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 1 -an -f avi NUL\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 2 -c:a pcm_s16le output.avi\n```\n\n- `-b:v 2M` sets video bitrate to 2 Mbps; adjust as needed.\n- `-pass 1`/`-pass 2` select the encoding pass.\n- `-an` in pass 1 disables audio.\n- `-c:a pcm_s16le` sets uncompressed audio in AVI for maximum compatibility.\n\nIf you want an output other than `avi` (like WebM or MKV, which are more appropriate for VP9), let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as described. Although it produces commands intended to transcode an MP4 file to AVI using the VP9 codec, it mistakenly uses AVI as the output format, which is generally not compatible with the VP9 codec for playback in most players. The model acknowledges this limitation but does not advise against using AVI, thus not fully aligning with user requirements for compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The commands themselves are syntactically correct according to FFmpeg's standards, and all specified options are valid in their context. Therefore, although it has compatibility issues with the AVI format and VP9, it does not fail in a way similar to the predefined example.\n\n3) The output commands do not break any specific requirements in the man page for FFmpeg. All options are valid and correctly formatted according to the manual. The commands demonstrate proper use of the `-pass` option for two-pass encoding, as well as other encoder options.\n\nBased on this evaluation, the model's output should be marked as a failure because it creates a command that runs the risk of failing upon execution due to potential playback compatibility issues with AVI containing VP9 codec, while not clearly conveying this risk or suggesting an alternative format such as MKV or WebM which would be more suitable."
