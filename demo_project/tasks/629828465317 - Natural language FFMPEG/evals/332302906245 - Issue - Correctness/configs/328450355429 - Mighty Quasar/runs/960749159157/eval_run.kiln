  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To preserve the alpha channel when converting to WebM with VP9, you need to enable the alpha channel output by setting the `-pix_fmt` to `yuva420p`. VP9 in WebM supports alpha channels in this pixel format. Also, specify the video codec as `libvpx-vp9`.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p output.webm\n```\n\nAssumption: The input file `multitrack.mov` contains an alpha channel and the latest ffmpeg build is used, which supports VP9 alpha channel encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct for converting the video with an alpha channel to a WebM file while preserving transparency, which matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not have incorrect parameters or usage, and the options used are appropriate for the task at hand.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (`-c:v libvpx-vp9` and `-pix_fmt yuva420p`) are valid and appropriate for the specified task of preserving an alpha channel in a WebM file using VP9.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any incorrect commands or parameters, it does not fail. The command works correctly and fulfills the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation confidently."
