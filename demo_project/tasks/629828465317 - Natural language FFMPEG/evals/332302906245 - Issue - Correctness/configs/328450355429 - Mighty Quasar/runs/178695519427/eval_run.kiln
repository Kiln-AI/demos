  "input": "Convert my audio file song.wav to MP3 format with ultra_high quality preset and 320k bitrate",
  "output": "To convert song.wav to MP3 with the highest quality possible, use ffmpeg's ultra quality preset and set the audio bitrate to 320k, which is the standard for \"high quality\" MP3 files. The ultra quality preset maximizes encoding quality at the expense of speed and file size (this is usually a good trade-off for music).\n\nKey points:\n- -c:a libmp3lame sets MP3 as the audio codec.\n- -b:a 320k sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- -q:a 0 uses the variable bitrate (VBR) quality scale for \"ultra-high\" quality using libmp3lame (where 0 is best in range 0-9).\n- You can add -abr 320k for strict constant bitrate, but VBR with -q:a 0 delivers better perceived quality at same average bitrate.\n\nHereâ€™s the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 song_hq.mp3\n```\n\nThis will produce song_hq.mp3, a high-quality MP3 file at 320 kbps. Note: The \"ultra quality preset\" refers to using `-q:a 0` with libmp3lame; ffmpeg doesn't offer quality presets in the style of video encoders.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appears to be correctly structured and adheres to the requirements for converting a .wav file to .mp3 format with specified settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 song_hq.mp3`) utilizes valid ffmpeg options and doesn't reference any non-existent presets or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options `-c:a libmp3lame`, `-b:a 320k`, and `-q:a 0` are valid and properly used in context. The order of options also follows the guidelines outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command is valid, well-structured, and matches the user's requirements, it should be evaluated as passing. The model's output is appropriate for the task given."
