  "output": "**Note:** There's a specification conflict here – WebM is a container format by Google that primarily uses VP8/VP9/AV1 video codecs, while `libx264` is an H.264 encoder (copyright/patent incompatible with WebM).\n\nSince you specified WebM format but also mentioned libx264, I'll provide two options:\n\n**Option 1: WebM-compliant (recommended)**\nUsing VP9 video and Opus audio – this will actually work in browsers and follow WebM standards.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus -b:a 96k output.webm\n```\n\n**Option 2: Your literal request** (H.264 in WebM container)\nTechnically possible but violates WebM specifications and may break in some browsers/players:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k -strict experimental output.webm\n```\n\nThe `-strict experimental` flag is required because FFmpeg warns this is non-standard. **Option 1 is strongly recommended** for compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. Specifically, it presents a conflict between the request for a WebM file and the use of the `libx264` codec, which is not compatible with the WebM format. The model correctly identifies this issue and offers two options, but the first option aligns better with the user's request and the expectations for the WebM format.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output (<failure_example>). While it provides a command that is technically possible, it also contains a disclaimer regarding its compatibility with WebM standards. The command itself is not outright incorrect as it is valid, just not recommended for use due to standards violations.\n\n3) The commands provided do not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The commands adhere to the expected syntax and structure outlined in the documentation, though the first command is preferred as it complies with the expectations for the WebM format.\n\n4) The model's output contains the issue described as it suggests a potentially non-compliant command for a WebM format. Therefore, it fails according to the specified criteria, as the primary requirement is to provide a valid and appropriate command that works correctly and matches the user’s specifications without introducing conflicts."
