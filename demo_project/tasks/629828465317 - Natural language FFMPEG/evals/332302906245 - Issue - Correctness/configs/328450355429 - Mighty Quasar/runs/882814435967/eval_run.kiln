  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using maximum compression, you should use ffmpegâ€™s built-in support for FLAC encoding and specify the compression level with the -compression_level parameter. FLAC supports compression levels from 0 (fastest, least compression) to 12 (slowest, maximum compression). Here, we use 12 for highest compression.\n\n- -vn disables video recording, extracting audio only.\n- -c:a flac specifies FLAC audio codec.\n- -compression_level 12 sets maximum compression.\n- The output extension .flac ensures proper container handling.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nThis produces a high-quality, highly compressed FLAC audio file extracted from the video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is appropriate for the task of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as a FLAC file with maximum compression. The parameters and their settings align with what is required.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not include any invalid parameters or unsupported options. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax and options used in the command follow the rules set for using ffmpeg and the extraction of audio from video. The model correctly used `-vn` to disable video, `-c:a flac` to specify the audio codec, and `-compression_level 12` which is indeed a valid option for FLAC compression levels.\n\n4) Since the model's output successfully meets the task requirements without errors, it passes this evaluation."
