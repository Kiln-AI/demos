  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 into a new output container (MP4 in this case), you need to specify the `-map` option in the ffmpeg command. The syntax for mapping a specific stream from a file is:\n\n```\n-map 0:<stream_index>\n```\n\nHere, `0` refers to the input file. `stream_index` is the sequence number or name of the stream you want to map (0-based). For example:\n\n- Stream 0:3 is video\n- Stream 0:5 is audio\n\nWhen converting from MKV to MP4, note that not all stream layouts match MP4 (e.g., some codecs or features are incompatible). For MP4, stream types and codecs supported are more limited compared to MKV. If stream compatibility is an issue, you may need to ensure the codec and container match.\n\nTo map clearly:\n\n1. Identify stream 0:3 as the video.\n2. Identify stream 0:5 as the audio.\n\nAssuming your MKV file has video and audio streams already named differently, we'll map both streams explicitly.\n\nCommand explanation:\n\n- `-i source.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:v:3` selects the video from stream 0:3.\n- `-map 0:a:5` selects the audio from stream 0:5.\n- `-c copy` copies all streams without re-encoding for speed and lossless quality (works only if codecs are compatible). If not, specify codecs explicitly.\n- Output is edited.mp4.\n\nIf stream compatibility is a concern or re-encoding is required (for codecs not compatible with MP4 container or stream formats), this command wonâ€™t work without specifying codecs or re-encoding.\n\nHere is a safe, straightforward command assuming no compatibility issues:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nIf streams cannot be copied directly (common when codecs differ in formats), replace `-c copy` with desired codecs (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`).\n\n---\n\nSummary: If the streams map directly without issues, use `-c copy` to stream copy without re-encoding, preserving quality and speed. Otherwise, specify codecs to re-encode.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model correctly specifies the input stream indices and uses the -map option appropriately for the intended transformation, which is mapping specific video and audio streams from an MKV file to an MP4 file. \n\n2) The output does not resemble the failure example. The command provided by the model is valid and follows the expected syntax for FFmpeg commands. There is no indication of an invalid option like `-preset extra_fast`, which would cause a failure.\n\n3) The command generated by the model follows the guidelines outlined in the FFmpeg man page. All options (i.e., -i, -map) are correctly used, and there are no syntax issues or misuse of options that would break the requirements dictated in the man page.\n\nOverall, the model's output is correct and adheres to the requirements set forth in the user's request, thus it does not contain the described issue."
