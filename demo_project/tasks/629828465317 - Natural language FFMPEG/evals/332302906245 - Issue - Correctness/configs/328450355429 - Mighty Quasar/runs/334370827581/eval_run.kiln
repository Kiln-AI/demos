  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize your shaky video using FFmpeg's built-in `deshake` filter, you can apply the filter directly in your command. The `deshake` filter attempts to minimize camera shake by analyzing frame motion and compensating it. It is suitable for moderate shake and works best with a relatively stable zoom.\n\nCommon parameters for `deshake`:\n- `rx`, `ry`: Maximum horizontal and vertical shift (in pixels). Typical values are 16–32.\n- `edge`: How to handle edges created by shifting (e.g., `blank`, `mirror`, `wrap`).\n\nHere’s a command that applies the `deshake` filter with reasonable defaults. Adjust `rx`/`ry` if your video has more/less shake.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=rx=16:ry=16:edge=mirror\" -c:a copy bumpy_ride_stabilized.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:a copy` preserves the original audio without re-encoding.\n- `edge=mirror` fills the shifted edges by mirroring, which looks more natural than default blank.\n- This filter works best when the shake is mostly translational (not severe rotation/zoom).\n\nFor more advanced stabilization (especially with rotation/zoom), consider FFmpeg's `vidstab` filters, but for your request, `deshake` is used as shown above.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated correctly uses the `deshake` filter for stabilizing the video and adheres to the FFmpeg syntax. The command should work as intended without any syntax errors.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command generated is valid, and there are no invalid or unsupported options present, unlike the failure example that includes a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct syntax for FFmpeg and uses valid parameters for the `deshake` filter, along with proper handling of audio encoding.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass."
