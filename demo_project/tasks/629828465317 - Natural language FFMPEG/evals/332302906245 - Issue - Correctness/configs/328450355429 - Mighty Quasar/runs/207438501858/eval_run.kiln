  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add external subtitles to your video while removing all existing subtitle tracks, we use the `-filter_complex` and `-map` options effectively. \n\n- The `subtitles` filter overlays the external `.srt` file onto the video.\n- The `-map` option is used to select only desired streams (audio and video), excluding existing subtitle tracks.\n- `select='not(type=S)'` in the subtitles filter ensures that existing subtitle tracks are removed.\n- Adjust the `force_style` or `fontfile` if you require specific styling, though this is optional and not used by default.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The external subtitle file is named `subtitles.srt` and is synchronized with the video.\n- You're using a common media container like MP4, and you want to output as MP4.\n- The video and audio tracks are to be retained without modification.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -filter_complex \"[0:v]select='not(type=S)',subtitles='subtitles.srt' [outv]\" -map \"[outv]\" -map 0:a -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -c:s mov_text -fflags +bitexact output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. The command provided attempts to remove existing subtitle tracks using the `select='not(type=S)'` filter, which is not a valid method for this purpose. The `select` filter is meant for selecting video frames based on certain criteria, not for excluding streams based on type (like subtitles). This command will likely fail to execute correctly as it conflicts with how ffmpeg's stream mapping works.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example given, as it misuses parameters in a way that could lead to a failed execution. However, it correctly follows the command structure and does not reference a non-existent option. The core logic issue is more about the use of the wrong filter.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements dictated in the man page, specifically regarding the misuse of the `select` filter for stream types. The approach to remove subtitle tracks should typically involve using the `-map` options to specifically exclude subtitle streams rather than trying to use a video filter inappropriately.\n\nIn summary, the model's output incorrectly constructs the ffmpeg command by misapplying a filter and therefore will not work correctly, leading me to conclude that the model's output indeed contains the issues described in the evaluation criteria. The output would fail to achieve the user's request effectively."
