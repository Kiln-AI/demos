  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map the third audio stream to the output while keeping the original video unchanged, you need to:\n\n- Identify the total number of audio streams in the input file (using ffprobe or ffmpeg -i).\n- Map the third audio stream to the output stream index (usually 2 if there are 3 audio tracks).\n- Copy the video stream without re-encoding to preserve quality and speed.\n\nAssuming you want to just show the video stream untouched with audio from the third stream:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c copy -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-map 0:v` selects all video streams.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects only the third audio stream.\n- `-c copy` copies everything without re-encoding, preserving original quality and encoding time.\n\nThis will create an output with the video unchanged and the third audio stream selected. If you need to write to a container not supporting the number of streams you have, you need to specify the desired output container format.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly maps the third audio stream (assuming there are at least three audio streams) and copies the video stream without re-encoding. The parameters used are appropriate for the task as specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not use an incorrect or non-existent parameter, such as `-preset extra_fast`, which would cause an error. Instead, the command ensures proper mapping and output structure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Each option is applied correctly according to the input/output mapping required by the task. The mapping syntax and copy commands used in the output command are valid per the ffmpeg documentation, and the sequence of options is also correct.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation of the model's performance against the requirements, it does not contain any issues and the command it generated is valid. Thus, it passes."
