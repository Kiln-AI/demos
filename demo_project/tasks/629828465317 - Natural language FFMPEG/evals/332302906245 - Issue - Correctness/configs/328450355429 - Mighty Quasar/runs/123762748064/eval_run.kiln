  "input": "I have a file `input.mov` and I want to convert it to MP4. Please use the `extra_fast` preset because speed is very important.",
  "output": "To convert your `input.mov` file to MP4 using the `extra_fast` preset, we will use H.264 for video encoding (as it’s broadly compatible), and transfer the audio stream as-is unless a specific codec is needed. Since the only requirement is speed, I will prioritize fast encoding over maximum compression.\n\n- `-preset extra_fast` is used to set the encoding speed priority.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes the video into H.264 (MP4-compatible).\n- `-crf 28` is quickly chosen as a default CRF value for fast encoding (may result in lower quality compared to CRF 23; you can increase quality by lowering this if needed).\n- `-movflags +faststart` is added so that the MP4 is playable in a browser even before the download completes.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream as-is, assuming it is already in a compatible format like AAC.\n- If the audio codec is not compatible, we would use `-c:a aac` instead.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset extra_fast -crf 28 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made**: \n1. The audio in the input file is already in a compatible MP4 audio format (like AAC). If not, replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` for audio re-encoding.\n2. You want a minimal quality encoding for speed. If you want to prioritize quality, a higher CRF value is not suitable — you may need to use both CRF and other parameters (bitrate) to balance speed and output quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The output specifies a correct command that aligns with the user's request for converting a file to MP4 format using the appropriate settings. The command generated correctly includes the encoding parameters (`-c:v libx264`, `-preset extra_fast`, etc.) and ensures it adheres to the requirements of speed (by using the `extra_fast` preset). All necessary considerations for audio and video compatibility were taken into account, demonstrating a proper understanding of the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example. The output includes the correct command syntax and properly includes an encoding codec alongside a specified preset and additional necessary options. It avoids major mistakes that would invalidate the command, such as using a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The modeling of command options correctly follows the syntax rules outlined in the documentation. The use of the `-preset extra_fast`, `-c:v libx264`, `-c:a copy`, and `-movflags +faststart` options is appropriate and correctly applied according to FFmpeg's guidelines. It respects the sequence of input and output specifications. \n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does NOT contain the issue described. The command appears to work correctly and meets the user's needs. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
