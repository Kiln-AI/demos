  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which streams you want in the output. This allows you to cherry-pick streams without re-encoding them.\n\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (index 1) from input 0\n- `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3) from input 0\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (fastest, preserves quality)\n\nI'm assuming you want to preserve the original quality of both streams. If the original codecs aren't compatible with MP4 container, ffmpeg will automatically re-encode, but this command attempts to copy first.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4`) correctly extracts the specified video and audio streams without errors and matches the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect parameters or assumptions that would lead to failure.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The usage of `-map` for selecting streams and `-c copy` for copying those streams without re-encoding is consistent with the guidelines in the man page. All options used in the command are valid and specified correctly.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation steps above, the model's output passes as it correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements without introducing errors or incompatible parameters."
