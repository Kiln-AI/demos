  "input": "Convert input.mkv to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset for maximum compression",
  "output": "To convert `input.mkv` to AVI format using **libx265 (HEVC)** with the **placebo** preset (for maximum compression efficiency, albeit very slow encoding), note that AVI containers typically do not support HEVC (libx265) due to format limitations. Instead, use **MP4** as a container for HEVC compatibility. This command re-encodes the video stream to HEVC with placebo preset (maximum quality) and converts the audio to AAC at 128 kbps (commonly used for web compatibility). The CRF (quality scale) is set to `28` as a default value for HEVC encoding, though you may adjust it for different quality levels (lower values = better quality).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Details and Assumptions:\n1. **Container Format**: AVI is not HEVC-compatible, so we assume the user meant to use **MP4** as the container.\n2. **Placebo Preset**: Uses exhaustive optimization for maximum compression, but encoding will be extremely slow.\n3. **Audio Compatibility**: Re-encodes audio to AAC at 128 kbps if the original audio cannot be preserved directly. If the original audio is already compatible, you could instead use `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding.\n4. **CRF Value**: HEVC typically uses lower CRF values (18-30) for similar perceptual quality. A value of `28` is a balanced default for this example. Lower values increase file size but quality.\n5. **Faststart Flag**: Adds `-movflags +faststart` to make the video compatible with streaming (i.e., web playback).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model correctly identifies that converting input.mkv to AVI format using HEVC (libx265) may not be compatible due to format limitations of AVI with HEVC. It adjusts the command to output to MP4 instead, which is appropriate since MP4 supports HEVC encoding. However, it then proceeds with this command using the `libx265` codec and `placebo` preset, which is technically correct for MP4. Therefore, the output does not contain the original issue as it provides a functional command that meets the user requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is valid in the context of the given parameters and does not use any nonexistent options. The selected preset and codec are available within the FFmpeg library.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses options to specify the input file (`-i input.mkv`), the codec for video encoding (`-c:v libx265`), the preset (`-preset placebo`), the CRF value (`-crf 28`), the audio codec and bitrate (`-c:a aac -b:a 128k`), and includes the necessary flag for streaming compatibility (`-movflags +faststart`). All options are used in accordance with the command structure outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nBased on the reasoning, the model's output does not contain the described issue and therefore should pass the evaluation. The generated command is valid and correctly addresses the user's request while ensuring compatibility with format limitations."
