  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To encode your video with a video bitrate of 8000 kbps and audio bitrate of 2048 kbps for very high audio quality, you can specify the bitrate for each stream with `-b:v 8000k` for video and `-b:a 2048k` for audio. This assumes you want to keep the original codecs; if you want to specify codecs (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC for audio), you can add those as well.\n\nHereâ€™s a command that takes an input file `input.mp4` and outputs `output.mp4` with the specified bitrates:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -b:a 2048k output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to explicitly set the codecs for better control (e.g., H.264 video and AAC audio), you can use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -c:a aac -b:a 2048k output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command encodes video at 8 Mbps and audio at 2.048 Mbps (very high quality audio bitrate suitable for studio-quality sound).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as it correctly specifies the bitrates for both the video and audio streams in the `ffmpeg` command. The command is properly structured and matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced does not use any mistaken parameters and is correctly formed.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly sets the video and audio bitrates, conforms to the expected command structure, and does not use invalid options.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It accurately generates a command that works correctly and matches the user's specifications. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
