  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To make `video.mp4` smaller, you can re-encode it using a more efficient compression setting. The easiest and most effective method is to lower the constant rate factor (`-crf`) for H.264, and optionally, reduce the resolution. A typical CRF value for decent quality and noticeable size reduction is 28. Setting the audio bitrate to 96k will also save space.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to keep the original resolution (if you want to scale down, let me know).\n- You want to output another MP4, compatible with most devices.\n\nHere’s a command that should significantly reduce the file size:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset veryfast -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart smaller_video.mp4\n```\n\n- `-crf 28`: Higher values mean smaller files and lower quality. Try 26-30 for smaller emails.\n- `-preset veryfast`: Faster processing; file size changes are minor between presets.\n- `-b:a 96k`: Compress audio to 96 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Enables instant playback if streamed.\n\nAdjust CRF higher for an even smaller file, or let me know if you want to downscale the resolution as well.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command appears to be correct and should work for the specified task of making the video file smaller. The options used (`-c:v libx264`, `-crf 28`, `-preset veryfast`, `-c:a aac`, `-b:a 96k`, and `-movflags +faststart`) are appropriate for reducing file size while maintaining reasonable quality.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not include any incorrect options, such as a nonexistent preset name. The model successfully uses recognized and valid options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All parameters used are correctly formed and apply to the input and output files according to the syntax specified. The order of options follows ffmpeg’s rules, ensuring that options like \"-c:v\" and \"-c:a\" are properly associated with their respective stream types.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues outlined, it passes the evaluation."
