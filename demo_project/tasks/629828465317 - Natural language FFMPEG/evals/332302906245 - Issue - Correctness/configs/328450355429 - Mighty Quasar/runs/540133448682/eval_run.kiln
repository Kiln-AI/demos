  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from video.avi and save them as PNG images with very high resolution, you can use the fps filter with 0.5 fps (1 frame every 2 seconds). For ultra high resolution, you might want to upscale the frames using the scale filter; if you want to keep the original resolution, you can skip scaling or upscale by a specific factor. Here, I'll assume you want to keep the original resolution for the best quality.\n\n- -vf fps=0.5 extracts one frame every 2 seconds.\n- Output as PNG images by specifying filename pattern like frame_%04d.png.\n\nIf you want to upscale the frames beyond original resolution, specify scale. Example: scale=3840:2160 for 4K. Let me know if you want that.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nIf you want me to upscale frames to a specific resolution, just tell me!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output generated by the model does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command is correctly formed to extract frames from the video every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images. The option `-vf fps=0.5` accurately meets the user's request for capturing frames every 2 seconds.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command given is valid and does not use any non-existent options or incorrect syntax. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command follows the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. It uses the correct syntax and valid options for extracting frames with a specified frame rate (`-vf fps=0.5`) and outputs them as PNG images using the correct file naming convention (`frame_%04d.png`). \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It successfully generates a command that is correct and matches the user's requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
