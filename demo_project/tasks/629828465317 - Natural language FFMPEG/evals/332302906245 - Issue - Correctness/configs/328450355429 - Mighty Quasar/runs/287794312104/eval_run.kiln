  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract only audio track 5 from input.mov and combine it with the video (keeping the default/main video stream), you need to use the -map option to precisely select the streams you want:\n\n- -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream from input.mov.\n- -map 0:a:4 selects the 5th audio track (stream indexing is zero-based, so a:4 is audio track 5).\n- -c copy stream-copies both video and audio without re-encoding (fast and lossless).\n\nThis command assumes input.mov has at least 5 audio tracks and a single main video stream, and you want to keep all other metadata and streams out.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:4 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis will create output.mov containing the video and only the specified (5th) audio track.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the problem statement. The generated command is correct for the user's request, as it accurately selects the specified video and audio streams for the output file. The correct usage of the `-map` option and the `-c copy` flag ensures that the media is processed without faults.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command uses valid `ffmpeg` syntax and correctly specifies the streams to be included in the output file without any errors or invalid options.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command complies with the requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. It properly uses the `-map` option to select the desired input streams for audio and video, and it employs `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding. There are no violations of the command syntax or rules as per the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It successfully generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's request without errors, and it adheres to the stated guidelines and options from the `ffmpeg` man page. Therefore, the output passes the evaluation criteria."
