  "input": "I need to convert my video to MP4 with a bitrate of 50000k for high quality output.",
  "output": "To convert your video to MP4 with an *extremely high* video bitrate of 50,000 kbps (50 Mbps), use the following approach. This high bitrate is likely tailored for ultra-high-quality output (e.g., archival purposes) but will result in a very large file size. The command ensures compatibility by using H.264 video, AAC audio, and yuv420p pixel format.\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: H.264 video codec (standard for MP4).\n- `-b:v 50000k`: Sets the video bitrate to 50,000 kbps (EXTREMELY HIGH, assumes destination supports such throughput, e.g., local playback or specialized streaming).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encodes audio with AAC at 128 kbps (standard quality, you can increase if needed).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures compatibility with devices/browsers.\n- **Assumptions**: Original resolution is maintained (no scaling), input format unspecified (works for most common types), and audio bitrate 128k is acceptable.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n**Note**: For most purposes, this bitrate is unnecessarily high. Consider using `-crf 23` (default) or lower for better compression and quality. If streaming is intended, ensure your use case specifically requires 50 Mbps as many players/libraries may not handle it efficiently.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described because the generated ffmpeg command is correct in terms of syntax and functionality. It accurately specifies the video and audio codecs and sets the video bitrate as requested by the user. From a technical perspective, it adheres to the user's requirement of converting video to MP4 at a bitrate of 50000k.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4`) uses valid options and syntax that align with the ffmpeg command-line usage.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used are standard and properly placed, including the video codec, audio codec, bitrate settings, and pixel format. There are no unsupported options or incorrect parameter placements.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model does not contain syntax issues, improper command elements, or misalignment with user requirements, it can be concluded that the model's output is correct. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation with no issues."
