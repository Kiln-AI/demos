  "input": "Create a 'matrix' style video from `input.mp4` by changing the color so it's all green and black.",
  "output": "To create a colorful matrix from `input.mp4`, we'll apply a combination of color-space conversion and chroma keying. Specifically, we'll isolate the chroma (color information) and set the luminance (brightness information) to specific values.\n\n<output>\n\nFirst, we isolate the luminance channel.\n\n- aformat -map 0:s:? discards non-keyframe audio streams and isolates the chroma (yuv420p).\n\nNext, we mask the luminance channel using simple thresholding. Below this mask will be black, and above it, we'll add green.\n\n- cmp -cmpfunction lower above=0.33 lower=0.675 black=0 y=black,y=green\n\nFinally, we recombines the chroma channel with the updated luminance channel to form the final output.\n\n- color matrix\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -format yuv420p -map 0:s?:0:6400 -cmp cmp -cmpfunction lower above=0.33 lower=0.675 black=0 black y=green color_matrix -y input_matrix.mp4\n```\n</output>\n\nThe results will resemble a simple matrix where all non-black pixels are green. This produces a colorful matrix effect from the original input.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command it generated is not valid and will not work correctly. Parameters such as `-format`, `-map`, and `-cmp` with `-cmpfunction` are incorrect as they are not standard options in `ffmpeg`. The masking and chroma manipulation described are not accurately represented in the command provided, which does not produce the desired matrix effect.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failing output example given. The command produced includes nonexistent options, like `-format` and `-cmp`, as well as incorrect syntax for what is described, which should fail upon execution.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks several requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options `-format`, `-map`, and `-cmp` with the associated parameters are invalid according to the `ffmpeg` documentation. Additionally, the command does not follow the syntax rules stated, where options and parameters must adhere to the specified formats.\n\nConclusion: The model's output contains significant mistakes in both logic and syntax, failing to produce a functional `ffmpeg` command. Therefore, it does contain the issue described in the evaluation criteria."
