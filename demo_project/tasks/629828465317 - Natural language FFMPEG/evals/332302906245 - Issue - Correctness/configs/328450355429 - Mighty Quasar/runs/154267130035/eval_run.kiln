  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, you can use the `xfade` filter or the `vstack` filter, but `vstack` is the most straightforward for stacking videos directly one on top of the other. Ensure that both videos have the same width and frame rate for proper stacking, or you may need to scale them first.\n\nAssuming both videos are compatible in width and frame rate, the command uses the `vstack` filter:\n\n- `-i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4`: specify input files.\n- `filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2\"`: stack the videos vertically.\n- `-c:v libx264`: encode the output with H.264 for compatibility.\n- `-crf 23`: set quality.\n- `-preset fast`: optimize encoding speed.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: encode audio in AAC at 128kbps (or copy audio if you prefer).\n- `-y`: overwrite the output file if it exists.\n\nIf the videos have different widths, scaling may be necessary, but for simplicity, this assumes compatible dimensions.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -y stacked.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command effectively stacks two videos vertically as requested by the user, using the appropriate `vstack` filter and ensuring that both inputs are specified correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain any non-existent options or misused parameters like `extra_fast`. The resulting command should work as intended for the specified task.\n\n3) The command complies with the requirements found in the FFmpeg man page. It properly follows the order of options and input files. The command structure, including the usage of `-filter_complex` and encoding parameters, adheres to general rules specified.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and is valid, meaning it should pass the evaluation."
