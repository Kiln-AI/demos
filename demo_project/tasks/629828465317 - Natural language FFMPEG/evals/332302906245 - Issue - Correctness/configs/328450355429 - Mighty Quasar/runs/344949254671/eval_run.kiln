  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility across all devices, the video will be encoded with H.264 (for universal video support) and AAC (for universal audio support). The output will use the MP4 container, which is widely supported. Key parameters include:\n\n- **-c:v libx264**: Uses H.264 video codec for broad compatibility.  \n- **-preset slow**: Optimizes compression efficiency (trade-off with encoding speed).  \n- **-crf 23**: Sets a balanced quality level (lower = better quality).  \n- **-c:a aac**: Uses AAC audio codec for compatibility with most devices.  \n- **-b:a 128k**: Sets a standard audio bitrate for streaming and playback.  \n- **-pix_fmt yuv420p**: Ensures pixel format compatibility with older devices.  \n- **-movflags +faststart**: Moves metadata to the start of the file for web streaming compatibility.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```  \n\n*Assumptions*:  \n- The input file is in a format compatible with FFmpeg (e.g., MP4, AVI, MKV).  \n- The user wants a default resolution (no scaling applied).  \n- The input audio is in a format that can be remuxed or transcoded to AAC.  \n- The output should prioritize compatibility over encoding speed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command appears to correctly match the user's request for a transformation of the media file with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings, using widely accepted codecs and parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output because the command generated does not contain any incorrect options. All options used in the command (such as `-preset slow` and `-c:v libx264`) are valid and recognized by ffmpeg.\n\n3) No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All the options used in the command are valid and correctly placed in accordance with the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described and produces a valid command according to the requirements. The output can be considered successful."
