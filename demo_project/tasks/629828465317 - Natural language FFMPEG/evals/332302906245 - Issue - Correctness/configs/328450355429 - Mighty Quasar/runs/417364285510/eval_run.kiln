  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To make `video.mp4` smaller for easier emailing, you can re-encode it with a lower bitrate and adjust the resolution if needed. This reduces file size at the cost of some quality. \n\nHereâ€™s what the parameters do:\n- `-c:v libx264`: encode video in H.264 for good compression.\n- `-b:v 800k`: limits the video bitrate to about 800 kbps, reducing file size.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: encodes audio in AAC at a standard 128 kbps.\n- `-preset fast`: balances encoding speed and compression.\n- Optionally, scale the video down if your original is very high resolution.\n\nIf you want smaller size with decent quality and no resolution change:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 800k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -preset fast -movflags +faststart small_video.mp4\n```\n\nIf your original video is high resolution and you want to downscale as well (e.g., to 720p) for even smaller size:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 800k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -preset fast -movflags +faststart small_video.mp4\n```\n\nAdjust the bitrate (`-b:v`) or resolution (`-vf scale`) to further control the file size.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues related to the `ffmpeg` command it generates. The command appears to be valid and matches the user's request to reduce the size of the video file for easier emailing.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated uses valid parameters and adheres to the syntax and options for `ffmpeg`. Specifically, `libx264`, `aac`, and the specified bitrates are all valid and commonly used options.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options used are correctly formatted and applicable for the command specified. The bitrate settings, codec selections, and other parameters comply with the usage described in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, since the command generated is valid, functional, and adheres to the rules set forth by `ffmpeg`, it passes the evaluation."
