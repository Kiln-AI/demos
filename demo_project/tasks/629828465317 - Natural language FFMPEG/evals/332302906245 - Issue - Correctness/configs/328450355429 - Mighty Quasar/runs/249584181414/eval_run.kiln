  "output": "To extract the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from a complex media file in `ffmpeg`, you use stream mapping with `-map`. This allows you to pick specific streams by their stream index, where stream numbering starts at 0 within each type (video, audio, subtitle).\n\nIn your case:\n- The 7th video stream corresponds to `-map 0:v:6` (index 6 because it is zero-based).\n- The 14th audio stream corresponds to `-map 0:a:13`.\n\nWhen using `-map`, you should also copy codecs or re-encode them depending on your needs. Here, I will assume you want to copy these streams without re-encoding for efficiency, but if you want to re-encode, let me know.\n\nUsing `-c copy` copies the selected streams directly.\n\nHere's the command to select these specific streams and produce a single output file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```\nThis assumes input.mov has at least 7 video streams and 14 audio streams. If any stream is missing or you want specific stream types or formats, please specify.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated uses valid syntax for `ffmpeg` and correctly maps the specified streams based on the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced is valid and does not contain any elements that are incorrect, unlike the example provided.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The syntax used (`-map 0:v:6` for the 7th video stream and `-map 0:a:13` for the 14th audio stream) follows the guidelines for stream mapping, and `-c copy` correctly preserves the original codecs without re-encoding if that is indeed desired.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output **does not** contain the issue, and therefore it should pass. The command is appropriately structured and aligns with how `ffmpeg` is intended to be used."
