  "input": "I need to reverse my video `clip.mp4`. Make it play backwards, including the audio.",
  "output": "To reverse a video and make it play backwards including the audio, you'll need to reverse the frame order for video and the sample order for audio. This requires reading the entire file into memory (`-filter_complex`), reversing both streams, and then creating a new file.\n\n- Using `-filter_complex` allows you to apply the reverse filters to both video and audio streams at once\n- `[0:v]reverse` reverses the video frames\n- `[0:a]areverse` reverses the audio samples\n- The `-map` parameters ensure both reversed streams are included in the output\n\nNote that this operation will load the entire video into memory, so it may be slow for large files. If you're working with a large file with long duration, you might want to consider splitting it into shorter segments first.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i clip.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]reverse[v];[0:a]areverse[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" reversed_clip.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issues described in the issue description. The command generated is correct for reversing a video and audio stream using valid parameters, and it accurately reflects the user requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated is valid and correctly utilizes the `-filter_complex`, `reverse`, and `areverse` filters which exist in `ffmpeg`. There is no incorrect or non-existent command or option used. \n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It adheres to the correct syntax and options for reversing video and audio using filters. The usage of the `-filter_complex`, `-map` options, and stream reversing techniques are all properly aligned with what is specified in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on the first three points, the model's output does **not** contain any issues and successfully meets the criteria for the task. Thus, it should pass this evaluation."
