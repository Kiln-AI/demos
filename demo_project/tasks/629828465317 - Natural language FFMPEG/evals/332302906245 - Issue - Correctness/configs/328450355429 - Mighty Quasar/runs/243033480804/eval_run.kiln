  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "The hyper preset in ffmpeg is designed for the fastest possible encoding, trading off compression efficiency and quality for encoding speed. As of libx264 (the most commonly used H.264 video encoder), the hyper preset offers maximal encoding speed, which is great for quick test encodes or workflows where turnaround time is critical.\n\nBest practices for hyper compression:\n- Use the CRF (Constant Rate Factor) method for quality control (default 18, but higher/lower values adjust quality; 23 is a good compromise; higher values=more compression).\n- Use the hyper preset and a lower -preset value for maximum speed.\n- Consider using a fixed bitrate (e.g., -b:v 2M) if you need a specific output file size.\n- Remove filters unless required, as they slow down encoding.\n\nHere's an example using H.264 encoding with the hyper preset and CRF 28 (higher compression, faster, but may lose qualityâ€”adjust as needed):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart video_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:  \n- Output should be browser-compatible MP4 (thus the -movflags +faststart).\n- AAC audio for wide compatibility. \n- Adjust -crf for balancing quality and file size for your needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated appears to be valid and conforms to the user's request for compression with the \"hyper\" preset. All parameters used in the command seem appropriate for the ffmpeg functionality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart video_compressed.mp4`) correctly uses an existing preset and valid parameters, unlike the failing example, which used a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The command structure appears to follow the rules outlined in the man page, with appropriate options for input and output. The \"-preset hyper\" is valid as it corresponds to an actual existing preset in ffmpeg.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any of the issues specified, meaning it has generated a correct, usable command for the task assigned without errors or breaking guidelines set forth in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, the output can be considered successful."
