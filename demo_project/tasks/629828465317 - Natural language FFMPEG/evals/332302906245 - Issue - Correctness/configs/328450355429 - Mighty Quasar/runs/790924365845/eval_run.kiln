  "output": "To convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 with realtime preset and constant bitrate mode, you'll use the libvpx encoder with specific rate control settings.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx` uses the VP8 video codec\n- `-cpu-used 8` sets the realtime preset (fastest encoding, values 0-16 where higher = faster/lower quality)\n- `-b:v` sets the target video bitrate for constant bitrate mode (I'm assuming 1Mbps - adjust as needed)\n- `-minrate` and `-maxrate` set to the same value as bitrate to enforce CBR\n- `-c:a libvorbis` uses Vorbis audio codec (standard for WebM)\n- `-b:a 128k` sets audio bitrate to 128kbps\n\nI assumed a video bitrate of 1Mbps since you didn't specify - adjust this based on your quality/file size requirements.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -cpu-used 8 -b:v 1M -minrate 1M -maxrate 1M -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.webm\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the specific issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is valid and corresponds accurately to the user's request to convert `video.avi` to WebM format using VP8 codec with real-time preset and constant bitrate mode. All parameters and options used are correct according to the ffmpeg guidelines.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command is correctly structured, using valid parameters and codecs. It doesn't include any parameters that are non-existent or incorrectly formatted. The output should work correctly when executed in the command line.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. Each option is correctly applied for the intended output. The use of `-c:v libvpx`, `-cpu-used 8`, `-b:v 1M`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, `-c:a libvorbis`, and `-b:a 128k` are appropriate and follow the expectations for video and audio parameters according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues and correctly reflects the user's request, it passes the evaluation overall."
