  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To select video and audio streams from a file and re-encode them into a new file, you can use the `-map` option followed by the stream identifiers specified. Here, we're selecting streams:\n\n- `stream 0:3` for the video, meaning the fourth stream (vcodec stream) and assuming all inputs are in yuv420p or similar format, which most outputs (`x264` for example) can handle.\n- `stream 0:5` for the audio, meaning the fifth stream.\n\nTo ensure compatibility for mp4 output, and considering you might want to maintain original aspect ratios:\n \n- `-vf scale=宽高` specifies the desired width and height. Here, we're keeping the width and height as is for an original size of 1920x1080. Adjust this according to your needs, keeping in mind Aspect ratios and yuv420p output.\n\n- `-c:a libfaac` uses x264's AAC encoder based on H.264's AAC audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -vf scale=1920 output.mp4\n```\nNote: If your x264 uses AAC for audio, then the `-c:v libfaac` line would be optimized by removing `-c:v libx264` as we want to set both outputs correctly once.\nHowever, -c:a uses default encoding (libx264) for yuv420: ```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -vf scale=1760 -c:a libfaac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nYes, the model's output contains several issues. Firstly, the command it generated does not correctly specify the audio codec. Instead of using `-c:a libfaac`, an AAC encoder should be specified, like `-c:a aac`. Additionally, there are some errors regarding parameters. The `-vf scale` option used does not make sense in this context since the user didn't specify a desired resolution, and the output resolution is not given correctly in the final command either.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nWhile the model’s output does not include an entirely nonsensical parameter (like a non-existent preset), it does have inaccuracies in command construction and codec specification which could lead to failure when executed, similar to the provided failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nYes, it breaks the requirements found in the man page for ffmpeg in the following ways:\n- The audio option `-c:a libfaac` is incorrect as it references a codec that is considered deprecated or non-existent in the latest versions of FFmpeg. The correct encoding would typically be `-c:a aac`.\n- The video filter, specified as `-vf scale=宽高`, contains a placeholder which would not work and results in an incorrect command format. It should either omit the `-vf` parameter or provide an actual resolution based on the user's requirements.\n- The way parameters are presented does not follow standard practices outlined in the man page, which might confuse the user or lead to improper execution.\n\nOverall, the output should be marked as a failure due to incorrect and ambiguous command structure and codec specification that would likely not execute properly."
