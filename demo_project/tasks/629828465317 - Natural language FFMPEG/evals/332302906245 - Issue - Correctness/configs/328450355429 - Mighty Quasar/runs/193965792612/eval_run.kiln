  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select video stream 12 and audio stream 25, use the `-map` option. Note that stream numbering starts from 0, not 1. Therefore, video stream 12 is referenced as `0:12` and audio stream 25 as `0:25` in the `-map` arguments.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -map 0:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   `-i recording.mkv`: Specifies the input file as `recording.mkv`.\n*   `-map 0:12`: Selects the 13th video stream (stream 12, counting from 0) from the input file. `0` means the first input file.\n*   `-map 0:25`: Selects the 26th audio stream (stream 25, counting from 0) from the input file. `0` means the first input file.\n*   `-c copy`: Specifies that the streams should be copied without re-encoding. This is faster and preserves the original quality.\n*   `output.mkv`: Specifies the output file as `output.mkv`.\n\nThis command assumes that you want to keep the original codecs of the streams. If you need to change the codecs, you can replace `-c copy` with specific codec options (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`). It also assumes you want the output to be an MKV file, but you can adjust the output file extension as needed (e.g. use `output.mp4`).\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the provided framework:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output correctly maps the specified streams (video stream 12 and audio stream 25) from the input file `recording.mkv` using the `-map` option, and it generates an appropriate command. It does not appear to have any mistakes regarding the format or requirements specified by the user. Therefore, it does not contain the described issue, as the command is correct for the task.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output does not resemble the failing example. It does not include any incorrect parameters or commands such as a nonexistent preset. Instead, it utilizes valid options like `-map` and `-c copy`, which are correctly used, yielding a valid command. The command provided fulfills the userâ€™s requirements.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command follows the specifications in the man page. The use of `-map` is appropriate and formatted correctly (`-map 0:12` for video and `-map 0:25` for audio). The use of `-c copy` correctly indicates that streams should be copied without re-encoding, which aligns with the procedures outlined in the man page. There are no violations or incorrect usages of options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output should pass as it does **not** contain the issue described; it adheres to the requirements, is free from errors, and correctly addresses the user's request.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is correct and fully meets the requirements set by the user without any errors or misunderstandings."
