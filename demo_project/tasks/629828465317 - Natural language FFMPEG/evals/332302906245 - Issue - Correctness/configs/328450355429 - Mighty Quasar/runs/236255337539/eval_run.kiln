  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from the input file `broadcast.mkv` and save them into `trimmed.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include. Since the output format is MP4, we'll use H.264 for video and AAC for audio, which are standard and widely supported codecs.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file `broadcast.mkv` contains at least 10 streams (video 0:4 and audio 0:9 are valid indices).\n- The video stream 0:4 is a valid video track.\n- The audio stream 0:9 is a valid audio track.\n- You want to preserve the original quality of the selected streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac trimmed.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command provided in the output correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file, using appropriate codecs for the MP4 format. The command follows the syntax rules presented and effectively captures the userâ€™s request without introducing any syntax errors or invalid parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not include any non-existent options or incorrect syntax. The model's output accurately represents a command that should work correctly for the specified task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of the `-map` option is appropriate for selecting specific streams from the input file, and the specified codecs (`libx264` for video and `aac` for audio) are valid options when encoding to MP4. The overall command structure adheres to the guidelines and practices outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above assessments, the model's output does not contain any issues and should pass since it correctly formulates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user's requirements."
