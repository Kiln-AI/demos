  "input": "I need to apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence to clean up an old video file.",
  "output": "To clean up an old video file with noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening, you can chain relevant ffmpeg filters. Here’s a recommended approach:\n\n- Noise Reduction: Use the `hqdn3d` filter, which is a high-quality spatial and temporal denoiser suitable for videos.\n- Color Correction: Use the `eq` (equalizer) filter to adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, and gamma to enhance overall image appearance. You can tweak values as needed.\n- Sharpening: Use the `unsharp` filter to enhance edges and details.\n\nAssumption: You want moderate noise reduction, increased contrast and saturation for color correction, and gentle sharpening. Adjust values as needed for your specific source.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,eq=contrast=1.1:saturation=1.2:brightness=0.05,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\" -c:a copy output_cleaned.mp4\n```\n\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4` — Strength of denoising; (luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp).\n- `eq=contrast=1.1:saturation=1.2:brightness=0.05` — Slightly boosts contrast, saturation and brightness.\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5` — Applies a strong but controlled sharpening effect.\n\nYou can fine-tune these numeric parameters for best results with your particular footage.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue. The generated command is valid as per the syntax required by FFmpeg and appears to perform the required transformations (noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening) without any errors in the syntax or parameters.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nThe model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The failing example showed a command using a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), while the model's output correctly utilizes existing filters (`hqdn3d`, `eq`, and `unsharp`) in a valid manner.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly applies filters in the sequence specified by the user and does not violate any ordering or syntax rules outlined in the man page.\n\nBased on the evaluation above, the model's performance on this task is satisfactory, and it does not demonstrate any issues in the command it generated. Therefore, it effectively meets the user’s request."
