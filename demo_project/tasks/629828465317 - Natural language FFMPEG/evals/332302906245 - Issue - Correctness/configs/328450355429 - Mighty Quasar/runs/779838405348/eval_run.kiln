  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated correctly maps the first video stream and the third audio stream, as requested by the user, and the formatting adheres to the requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is not in error due to incorrect parameters or nonexistent options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used (`-map`, `-c:v copy`, `-c:a aac`, `-strict experimental`) are appropriate and valid. However, the use of `-map 3:a` assumes that the third audio stream exists in the input file. If the userâ€™s input file (`movie.mkv`) does not have a third audio stream, this would lead to a failure. But without additional context about the input file, it's reasonable to assume that it meets the user's description.\n\n4) Overall, I conclude that the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the failure example, and adheres to the parameters as outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should be considered a valid output, assuming the input file contains the expected streams."
