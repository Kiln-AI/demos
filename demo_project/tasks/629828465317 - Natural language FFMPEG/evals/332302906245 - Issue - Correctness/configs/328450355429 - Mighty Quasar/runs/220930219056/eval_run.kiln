  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add new subtitles to your video while removing any existing subtitle tracks, you should:\n\n1. Exclude all subtitle streams from the input file using ffmpeg’s stream selection (-map 0) and disabling subtitle mapping (-map -0:s).\n2. Add the new subtitles as an external file (e.g., subtitles.srt, assuming you have it as an SRT file) using the -scodec mov_text (for MP4 output) or -c:s mov_text, which is common for embedding in MP4 files.\n\nAssuming your input file is input.mp4 and your new subtitles are in subtitles.srt:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt -map 0 -map -0:s -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `-map 0` includes all streams from the input,\n- `-map -0:s` excludes all original subtitle streams,\n- `-vf subtitles=subtitles.srt` burns the subtitles into the video (if you want hardcoded subs), or...\n- If you want to **embed** (softsub) the new subtitles instead of burning, use:\n    ```bash\n    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0 -map -0:s -map 1:0 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n    ```\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies video and audio without re-encoding,\n- `-c:s mov_text` encodes the new subtitle as mov_text (MP4 compatible).\n\n**Choose which version you want:**  \n- For hardcoded subtitles: use the first command.\n- For softsubs (embeddable, toggleable subtitles): use the second command.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your new subtitles are in subtitles.srt.\n- The output is MP4.\n- You want either hard or soft subtitles as described above.  \nIf you wish to specify a different output format or subtitle type, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The model provided two commands: one for hardcoding subtitles and another for softcoding them. Both commands include the option to remove existing subtitle tracks and add external subtitles effectively, aligning with the user’s request. Therefore, the output does not contain the issue of generating a malfunctioning command. It accurately addresses the requirements of adding new subtitles while removing existing ones.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the commands generated by the model do not resemble the failing example provided. The failing output example contains a command that utilizes a non-existent preset, whereas the commands generated by the model utilize valid options and parameters available within the ffmpeg command set. Thus, this does not constitute a failing output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Upon reviewing the model's output alongside the ffmpeg man page, the command adheres to the guidelines set forth. \n     - Both commands make effective use of options such as `-map`, `-vf`, and codec specifications appropriately.\n     - The flow of the command follows the correct order (input options, processing, and output).\n     - The use of `-map 0` and `-map -0:s` for stream management, as well as the correct incorporation of subtitles via `-c:s mov_text`, complies with the man page requirements.\n   \n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates commands that are likely to work correctly based on the user’s request, comply with the ffmpeg man page, and use existing features of the ffmpeg tool.\n\n**Final Evaluation: Pass**"
