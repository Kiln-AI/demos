  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams in ffmpeg, use the `-map` option followed by the input stream specifier. Streams are usually numbered starting from 0 per input file, so `-map 0:15` selects the 16th stream (stream index 15) from the first input, and `-map 0:22` selects the 23rd stream (stream index 22). \n\nThe command below takes `source.mkv`, selects video stream 15 and audio stream 22, and copies them without re-encoding (`-c copy`). Adjust codecs or output filename as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file and copies them without re-encoding, which is exactly what the user requested.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid within the parameters of what the user has requested.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements from the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-map` to select specific streams and `-c copy` to copy them is compliant with the guidelines set forth in the documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nIt should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue. In this case, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate and matches the user requirements accurately. Therefore, the result is a pass."
