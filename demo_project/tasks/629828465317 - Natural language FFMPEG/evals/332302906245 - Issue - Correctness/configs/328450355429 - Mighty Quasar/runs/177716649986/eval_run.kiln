  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set your video bitrate to 10,000,000 bits per second (10 Mbps) and audio bitrate to 1,000,000 bits per second (1 Mbps) for a streaming setup, you can use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` parameters respectively. This ensures that the video and audio streams are encoded with the specified bitrates, which is useful for maintaining consistent quality and performance in streaming environments.\n\n- `-b:v 10000000` sets the video bitrate to 10 Mbps.\n- `-b:a 1000000` sets the audio bitrate to 1 Mbps.\n\nThese values are suitable for most streaming platforms, but actual performance may vary depending on your content and the platform's requirements.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 10000000 -b:a 1000000 output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated puts the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options before the output file, which is correct according to the usage rules of `ffmpeg`. Thus, the command matches the user requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command does not use any undefined presets or incorrect parameters, and it does not contain any obvious mistakes in the parameters used.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options `-b:v` and `-b:a` are valid options for setting video and audio bitrates, and their syntax correctly follows the format specified in the man page. The command properly specifies the input and output files in the correct order.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the example of a failing output, and complies with the requirements of the `ffmpeg` man page, I would conclude that it passes the evaluation criteria."
