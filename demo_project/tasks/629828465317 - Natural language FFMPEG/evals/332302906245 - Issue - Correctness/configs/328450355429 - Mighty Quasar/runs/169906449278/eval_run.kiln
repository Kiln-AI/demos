  "input": "Please convert my file.mov to MP4 using the vp9 codec with the ultrafast preset",
  "output": "VP9 is a video codec often used in WebM containers but can be placed in MP4 as well, though not widely supported. Since you asked for MP4 specifically, I'll assume you want to use VP9 video encoding in an MP4 container. The ultrafast preset enables the fastest encoding but with larger file size and lower compression efficiency.\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command to convert file.mov to MP4 with VP9 codec and ultrafast preset:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -preset ultrafast -c:a libopus output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Use VP9 codec for video\n- `-preset ultrafast`: Set the encoding preset to ultrafast for very fast encoding\n- `-c:a libopus`: Use Opus codec for audio (since MP4 might not support original audio codec with VP9)\n- `output.mp4`: Output filename with MP4 extension\n\nNote: VP9 inside MP4 is not very common and might not be supported by all players. If you want better compatibility, consider using `libx264` for H.264 codec.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is valid and conforms to the user's request to convert the `.mov` file to `.mp4` using the VP9 codec and the ultrafast preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is correctly formatted and uses valid codec and preset options that exist in FFmpeg, unlike the `extra_fast` error in the failure example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used (`-c:v libvpx-vp9 -preset ultrafast -c:a libopus`) are valid, no syntax errors are present, and the overall structure follows FFmpeg's command-line structure.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation."
