    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains the issue. The command attempts to set two video codecs (`-c:v libx264` and `-c:v libx265`) for the same input file, but FFmpeg does not support applying multiple codecs to the same stream in a single command. Each output file can only have one codec applied to it.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the `failure_example` provided. The failure example demonstrates a command that uses a non-existent preset, which is a different type of error. The model's output syntax is mostly correct but logically flawed due to trying to assign codecs inappropriately.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, using `-c:v` multiple times in the context of the same output file breaks the requirement that options are applied to the next specified file. Each output file should have one codec specified, and the model's command structure incorrectly tries to apply two codecs to separate output files without proper organization. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. It executes commands that will not function correctly due to the logical error of attempting to use multiple video codecs on the same input stream simultaneously within a single command context."
