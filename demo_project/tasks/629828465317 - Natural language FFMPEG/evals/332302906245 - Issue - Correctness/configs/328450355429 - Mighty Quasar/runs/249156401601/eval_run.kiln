  "input": "I want to encode my video with the flash preset to get the conversion done as quickly as possible.",
  "output": "To encode your video quickly using a preset optimized for speed, you can leverage ffmpeg's preset options. The `ultrafast` preset prioritizes encoding speed over output quality/file size. I will assume you want to keep the same container format as the input file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n*   `-c:v libx264` specifies that the video stream should be encoded using the libx264 encoder (H.264).\n*   `-preset ultrafast` sets the encoding preset to \"ultrafast,\" which sacrifices compression efficiency for the fastest possible encoding speed.\n*   `-c:a copy` tells ffmpeg to stream copy the audio from source to output, to avoid spending time transcoding.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid, matches the user's request for a fast encoding preset, and uses valid parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated does not use a nonexistent preset and adheres to the valid use of ffmpeg options.\n\n3) The command generated by the model respects the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-c:v libx264`, `-preset ultrafast`, `-c:a copy`) are all valid. There are no conflicts with the guidance given in the man page regarding option usage and order.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and adheres to the task requirements, passing all evaluation criteria without issue."
