  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 6 audio streams. I need to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12 for my output file final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you use the `-map` parameter to specify which input streams to include in the output. This allows you to cherry-pick exactly which video and audio tracks you want.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_index:stream_type:stream_index` where stream indices start from 0. So to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:v:8` selects video stream 8 from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:12` selects audio stream 12 from input 0  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\nI assumed your input file is named something like `input.mkv` since you didn't specify the filename, and used copy mode to preserve quality and speed up processing.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly uses the `-map` parameter to select the specific video and audio streams as requested by the user. It meets the requirements outlined by the user without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated does not contain any invalid options or syntax that would lead to failure. In contrast, it correctly utilizes available options and parameters as specified in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of the `-map` parameter is appropriate for selecting streams, and the command follows the correct syntax as outlined in the ffmpeg documentation. There are no conflicting options or errors in the command.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It effectively generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements without errors. Therefore, it should pass."
