  "input": "Help me create a complex filter that resizes, adds border, and applies motion blur. Use -vf 'scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black;mblur=radius=3' for the transformations.",
  "output": "You're looking to apply several effects in sequence: resize the video to 1920x1080, add a black border to fit that resolution, and apply motion blur with a radius of 3. \n\nYou need to combine the filters into a single filterchain with -vf, using commas to chain filters (serial execution) and appropriate semicolon syntax for splitting if necessary. In this case, chaining them in this order (scale → pad → mblur) is done simply with commas.\n\nHere’s how the breakdown works:\n\n- scale=1920:1080 resizes the input to 1920x1080.\n- pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black adds a black border if needed (with these settings, padding won't change the frame because it's already 1920x1080—consider changing scale if you want obvious padding).\n- mblur=radius=3 applies motion blur with a radius of 3.\n\nSo the command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black,mblur=radius=3\" output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is `input.mp4` and the output is `output.mp4`.\n- The input may not already be 1920x1080; scaling ensures the correct size.\n- If the video is already 1920x1080, padding will have no visible effect.\n- The mblur filter may need an ffmpeg build with `frei0r-plugins` enabled, as it's less common in stock ffmpeg binaries.\n\nIf you run into errors with mblur, try with `tblend` or check your ffmpeg build for support.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and effectively implements the user's request for resizing the video, adding a border, and applying motion blur.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is syntactically correct and uses valid filter options.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements in the man page. Each filter is correctly formatted, and the command structure follows the conventions laid out for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-vf` (video filter) to apply the combination of filters correctly handles the operations as intended.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does NOT contain the issue described; it is accurate and meets the user's request without any syntactical errors. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
