  "input": "How do I chain together a deinterlace filter, frame rate conversion, and color space conversion for broadcast compatibility?",
  "output": "To chain multiple video filters in ffmpeg, use the -vf option with filters separated by commas, which are applied in sequence. For broadcast compatibility, typical requirements often include:\n\n- Deinterlacing (e.g., using yadif, a high-quality deinterlacer).\n- Frame rate conversion (e.g., to 25 fps for PAL broadcast).\n- Color space conversion (e.g., to Rec. 709 using colorspace filter, since many broadcasts require BT.709 color primaries).\n\nAssuming your source is interlaced, you want to deinterlace first. Then, convert the frame rate, and finally fix the color space and transfer characteristics.\n\nHere’s how you’d set this up:\n\n- yadif: deinterlaces interlaced video (you can use other deinterlacers if preferred).\n- fps=fps=25: converts the frame rate to 25 fps.\n- colorspace= all required args for broadcast (e.g., primaries=bt709, transfer=bt709, matrix=bt709).\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif,fps=25,colorspace=all=bt709\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac output_broadcast.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n- -vf \"yadif,fps=25,colorspace=all=bt709\": Applies deinterlacing, sets frame rate, and enforces BT.709 color space for primaries, transfer, and matrix (broadcast standard for HD).\n- -c:v libx264: H.264 encoder, commonly used for broadcast delivery.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures broad compatibility (many broadcasts require 4:2:0 chroma subsampling).\n- -c:a aac: AAC is a commonly accepted audio codec; adjust bitrate as needed.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want 25 fps (change fps=xx as needed).\n- The broadcast targets HD with Rec.709 colorspace.\n- Output is H.264/AAC in an MP4 file; you can change the container and codecs as required for your particular broadcast specification.\n\nIf you need interlaced output (some broadcasts still require it), remove yadif and add -vf \"setpts=PTS, fps=... (as needed)\", and use -c:v libx264 -x264opts \"tff=1\" for top field first. For progressive, as above, is standard. Adjust as necessary.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is plausible and should work correctly for the intended transformations specified by the user. The command includes appropriate filter chains for deinterlacing, frame rate conversion, and color space adjustment, meeting the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated is logical and utilizes valid parameters that exist in ffmpeg, unlike the example where `extra_fast` is not a valid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options and filters used are all valid and follow the proper syntax. The order of the options also does not violate any rules regarding how they are applied.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model does not contain any issues, it passes the evaluation requirements. Thus, the model performed well in this instance."
