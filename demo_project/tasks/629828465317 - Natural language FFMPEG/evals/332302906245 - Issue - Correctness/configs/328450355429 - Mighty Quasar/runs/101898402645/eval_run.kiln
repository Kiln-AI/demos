  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "Certainly! To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, use the -map option followed by the stream specifier. For video stream 12 and audio stream 25, you'll use -map 0:v:12 and -map 0:a:25, where 0: refers to the first (only) input file.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want to keep the selected streams unchanged (\"copy\" the video and audio without re-encoding).\n- If you want re-encoding, let me know!\n\nHere’s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis will extract video stream #12 and audio stream #25 to the output file. The numbering for streams starts from 0, so make sure these numbers correspond to the actual stream indexes (not IDs or language orderings). Use ffprobe or ffmpeg -i recording.mkv to list streams if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It is accurate in generating the correct FFmpeg command to extract specific video and audio streams from the specified multi-stream file. The command provided by the model should work correctly for the task at hand.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select specified streams, and it employs `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding. Therefore, it does not exhibit any errors like the specified failure example.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly follows the order of options and adheres to how stream selection should be handled with the `-map` command.\n\n4) Therefore, considering that the model’s output is accurate and adheres to the necessary requirements, it should pass this evaluation."
