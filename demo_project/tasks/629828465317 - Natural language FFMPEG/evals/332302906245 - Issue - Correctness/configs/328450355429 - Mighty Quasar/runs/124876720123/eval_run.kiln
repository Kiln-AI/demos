  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": " To extract the 7th video and 14th audio stream from your input.mov file and merge them into a single output, you'll use `ffmpeg`'s stream mapping capabilities. This command assumes the video stream is numbered 1 and the audio stream is numbered according to this convention. It also presumes that all streams in your file are in a compatible format for export.\n\n\nHere are the details of the technique/parameters and the fully qualified `ffmpeg` command:\n\n- The `-map` option selects the streams to be included in the output. Enclose the stream index (starting at 0) in square brackets.\n- The `-c copy` option tells `ffmpeg` to copy the streams directly without re-encoding.\n- The output file extension determines the output format.\n\n\n```bash\n\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:7 -map 0:a:14 -c copy output_extracted.mp4\n\n```\n\n\nThis command will extract the 7th marked video stream (`-map 0:v:7`) and the 14th marked audio stream (`-map 0:a:14`) from multiple input tracks (if any), and then combine them into a single MP4 file (`output_extracted.mp4`). The `0` index indicates the first input file. The stream indices should match the physical order of the tracks in the input.ffmpeg file. Be sure that the audio stream index provided refers correctly to the desired audio stream (in this case, 14th) from your original input movie file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated correctly represents the user request to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the input media file to create a single output. The use of `-map 0:v:7` and `-map 0:a:14` accurately reflects the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and employs valid mapping for the streams. There are no mistakes like the non-existent preset issue in the example.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` for selecting input streams and `-c copy` for copying the streams without re-encoding is proper, and the output file format is compatible with the streams selected.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes the evaluation as it accurately fulfills the user input requirements and adheres to the correct syntax and rules outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Thus, it does not contain the issue described."
