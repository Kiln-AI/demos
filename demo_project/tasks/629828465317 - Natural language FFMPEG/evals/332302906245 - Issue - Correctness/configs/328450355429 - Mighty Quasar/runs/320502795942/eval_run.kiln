  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To create `edited.mp4` with video from stream `0:3` and audio from stream `0:5` of `source.mkv`, use the `-map` option to explicitly select these streams and transcode their contents appropriately for MP4 compatibility.  \n\n### Explanation of parameters:  \n- **`-map 0:3`** and **`-map 0:5`**: Select the specific video and audio streams from the input.  \n- **`-c:v libx264`**: Encode the video stream using H.264 (required for MP4 containers).  \n- **`-c:a aac`**: Encode the audio stream using AAC (required for MP4 containers).  \n- **`-movflags +faststart`**: Optimizes the file for streaming by placing metadata at the beginning.  \n\nAssumes the input streams are either already in H.264/AAC format or needs transcoding (MP4 requires these codecs). If the source streams use incompatible codecs (e.g., HEVC, DTS), transcoding is mandatory for MP4 compatibility.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -map 0:5 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```  \n\n### Optional Notes:  \n- Add `-c copy` (instead of transcoding) if the source streams are already H.264/AAC and you want to preserve quality without re-encoding.  \n- Adjust `-b:a` or `-crf` values for preferred audio/video bitrates/quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated addresses the user's request accurately by selecting the specified video and audio streams from the input file and encoding them into an MP4 format.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command includes valid options like `-map`, `-c:v libx264`, and `-c:a aac`, which are all legitimate and commonly used in ffmpeg. There is no invalid preset or option like `extra_fast` in the command.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` are all appropriate for the specified task. It correctly maps the video and audio streams and specifies necessary codecs for MP4 compatibility.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output should **pass**. The command works correctly, matches the user's requirements, and adheres to the established ffmpeg guidelines."
