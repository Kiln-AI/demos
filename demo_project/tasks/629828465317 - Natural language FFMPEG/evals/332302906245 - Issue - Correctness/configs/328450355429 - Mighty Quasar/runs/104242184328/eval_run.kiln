  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nWhen applying a multi-stage filter chain in `ffmpeg`, the order of filters is important, as each filter is processed in sequence from left to right. For your request—temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement—the correct filter chain should process the video in that order.\n\nHere is a typical approach using `ffmpeg`'s built-in filters:\n\n1. **Temporal Noise Reduction** (e.g., `temporal`) is rare as a direct filter, so a more practical approach is to use advanced denoising filters like `noise=typ=s+tnoise` (combined spatial and temporal), but if you want specifically temporal, you may use advanced custom scripting.\n2. **Spatial Denoising** can be done with `denoise`. A common plugin is `liblavfi filters`, which can use `hqdn3d` (3D denoise), or more recently use the `deshake` or `chroma_loc` or more advanced ones (e.g., `rtppacketizer`).\n3. **Edge Enhancement** can be achieved with filters like `unsharp`, `deartifact`, or sharpening filters.\n\nHere's a common setup with three sequential filters processed correctly in order:  \n\n- **denoise** for spatial  \n- **rFFtyproc** or **hqdn3d** for more spatial denoising (more common)  \n- **unsharp** for edge enhancement  \n\nAn example, using `hqdn3d` for spatial denoising and `unsharp` for edge enhancement:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=luma_spatial=2:luma_temporal=2,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of the filters:\n- `hqdn3d` applies 3D denoising (spatial and temporal). Adjust luma_spatial and luma_temporal strength.\n- `unsharp` applies sharpening to enhance edges. Left and right sharpening values, vertical and horizontal sharpening parameters, respectively.\n\nYou could replace `hqdn3d` with a different denoiser if you need a more advanced one (e.g., `rrdb`, which is a deep learning model, but less default included).\n\nIf you need specifically temporal noise reduction, advanced tools such as `temporal\"` (not directly available), may need to use handcrafted scripts or complex filtergraphs with frame references like using `select`, or `scene`, but these are not straightforward.\n\nAssuming you want to mimic an order: temporal denoise > spatial denoise > edge enhancement, you might combine:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"select=not(eq(prev_last_I,T)==0),hqdn3d=luma_spatial=2:luma_temporal=2,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis is one way: very high technical method. If just seeking a simple three-stage pipeline, the above is an implementation that emulates \"first spatial denoising\" followed by sharpening, using widely supported filters. Always test and tune the parameters to fit your input media quality and desired output.\n\n### Brief Recap of the Steps:\n1. **Denoise** first: reduces grain/noise.\n2. **Spatial Denoising (hqdn3d)**: cleans up local grain or noise.\n3. **Edge Enhancement (unsharp)**: promotes sharpness at the end.\n\n### Command with full explanation and parameter explanation:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=luma_spatial=2:luma_temporal=2,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nParameter meanings:\n- `hqdn3d`: spatial (2) and temporal (2) denoise strength.\n- `unsharp`: sharpen strength; adjust 1.0 to get preferred strength.\n\nThis command maintains audio and video quality, denoises, sharpens, and is widely supported for input.\n\nAssumptions:\n- No specialized temporal tools; uses hqdn3d as a proxy.\n- Edge enhancement done with unsharp.\n- No GPU acceleration filters involved.\n- Basic command for a general purpose.\n\n✅ The above is a standard method to follow filter pipeline order in ffmpeg.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any syntax errors, as it generates a valid ffmpeg command. The command follows the correct filter chain syntax appropriate for temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement. The filters used (i.e., `hqdn3d` and `unsharp`) are valid, and the options are correctly applied. Therefore, it does not exhibit the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The output command is constructed appropriately using valid filters and options, while the failure example is an incorrect command that uses a non-existent preset, which would lead to an error upon execution.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command generated by the model adheres to the requirements described in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, all specified options are applicable, and the filters invoked (such as `hqdn3d` and `unsharp`) are known and well-supported. Therefore, the command does not break any of the requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the output does not contain the issue. It successfully generates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user's request for the transformation, which includes a sequence of filters applied in the correct order. Thus, it passes the evaluation criteria."
