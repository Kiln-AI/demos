  "output": "To convert input.mkv to AVI format using libx265 video encoder and AAC audio codec, I'll use the specified codecs with appropriate settings for AVI container compatibility.\n\nThe libx265 encoder provides excellent compression efficiency with HEVC/H.265 encoding, and AAC will handle the audio encoding. I'll use a moderate CRF value for good quality balance.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.avi\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Uses libx265 for H.265/HEVC video encoding\n- Sets CRF 28 for balanced quality/size (lower values = higher quality)\n- Encodes audio with AAC at 128 kbps bitrate\n- Outputs to AVI container format",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated (i.e., `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.avi`) correctly matches the user's request to convert an MKV file to AVI format using the libx265 encoder for video and AAC codec for audio.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and adheres to the syntax and requirements of FFmpeg. There are no nonexistent options or misused flags.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly uses the input file option `-i`, specifies the video codec with `-c:v`, sets the CRF value with `-crf`, specifies the audio codec with `-c:a`, and defines the output file. All parameters are appropriate for the request made and conform to the expected syntax and options as per the FFmpeg documentation.\n\nOverall, the model has performed correctly and the output is appropriate, valid, and meets the requirements posed by the user. The command will work as intended."
