  "input": "Convert audio.aac to MP3 with ultra_fast_encode preset for quick processing",
  "output": "To convert audio.aac to MP3 rapidly, use ffmpeg with the -c:a libmp3lame encoder and specify the -preset ultra_fast option. This will significantly reduce encoding time, although it may increase the output file size or slightly degrade audio quality compared to slower presets.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want a standard 128kbps bitrate, suitable for most general listening. Adjust the -b:a parameter as needed.\n\nCommand:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.aac -c:a libmp3lame -preset ultra_fast -b:a 128k output.mp3\n```\n\n- -c:a libmp3lame selects the standard MP3 encoder.\n- -preset ultra_fast speeds up the encoding process.\n- -b:a 128k sets the audio bitrate for good balance between quality and size.\n\nThis will efficiently convert your AAC file to MP3, focusing on speed rather than optimal quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for converting an AAC audio file to MP3 using the libmp3lame encoder, which is valid and widely used for this purpose. The parameters used in the command are correctly aligned with the user's request and do not lead to any syntax errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i audio.aac -c:a libmp3lame -preset ultra_fast -b:a 128k output.mp3`) does not include a non-existent preset like `extra_fast`. Instead, the `ultra_fast` preset exists for the libmp3lame encoder. Therefore, there is no indication of a failure in this regard.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The order of options is correctâ€”options for input are placed before the input file, and options for output are placed after the output file. The parameters used are valid, and there are no conflicts or misuse of options in the execution of the command.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue. It is valid and appropriately formulated, and thus would pass this evaluation step."
