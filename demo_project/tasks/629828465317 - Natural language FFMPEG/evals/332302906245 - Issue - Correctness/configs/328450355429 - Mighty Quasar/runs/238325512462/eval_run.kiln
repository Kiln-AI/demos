  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine specific video and audio streams from your input file, you'll use ffmpeg's stream mapping feature with the `-map` parameter to select stream 0:2 (video from input 0) and stream 1:3 (audio from input 1).\n\nHowever, I notice you mentioned \"stream 1:3\" but only provided one input file. I'm assuming you meant to select video from stream 2 and audio from stream 3 of the same input file (recording.mov). If you actually have two separate input files, you'll need to specify both with `-i`.\n\n- `-map 0:2` selects the video stream (index 2) from the first input\n- `-map 0:3` selects the audio stream (index 3) from the first input  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for speed (assuming they're already in compatible formats)\n- If re-encoding is needed, remove `-c copy` and ffmpeg will use default codecs\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you actually have two input files and want video from the first file's stream 2 and audio from the second file's stream 3:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -i second_file.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains an issue as it assumes the user meant to select audio from a different input when the user explicitly stated the audio stream as `stream 1:3`. Given the user's input, no second input file was mentioned, making the assumption unnecessary. This could lead to confusion or incorrect usage from the user.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble a failing output like the example provided. It correctly invokes valid FFmpeg commands and does not include erroneous parameters, nor does it reference a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly uses stream mapping and the `-c copy` option which complies with FFmpeg's syntax and function.\n\n4) Given the evaluation, the model's output contains the issue as per the description since it made an assumption about the presence of a second input file that had not been stated by the user. The correct response should not have made this assumption. Therefore, the evaluation fails."
