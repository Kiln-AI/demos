  "output": "To extract specific streams from a file without re-encoding (stream copy), use `-map` to select the streams and `-c copy` to copy them as-is. Here you want the second video stream (index 1) and the fourth audio stream (index 3), thus `-map 0:1` and `-map 0:3`. \n\nThis command will create an output with just those two streams, in an MP4 container. Assuming the streams are compatible with MP4 (if the codecs are not compatible, transcoding would be needed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generates correctly extracts the specified video and audio streams from the input file without re-encoding them (using `-c copy`), aligning with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect parameters or mistakes such as referencing a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses options (`-map` and `-c copy`) that are valid and correctly applies them according to the requirement of the user to extract specific streams without modifying the underlying codec data.\n\n4) According to the evaluation criteria, the model's output does not contain the issue described (it produces a correct and functional ffmpeg command), so it should pass."
