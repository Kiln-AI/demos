    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. The command generated does not correctly apply multiple output options for audio extraction, particularly regarding the audio codec option `-c:a` being reused for both outputs. FFmpeg requires specific output options for each file and does not inherently understand that `-c:a` should apply to both outputs without proper mapping or separation of commands.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example contains an invalid preset parameter, while the model's output contains valid syntax but incorrect usage in terms of multiple outputs. \n\n3) Reviewing the command against the FFmpeg documentation, the order of options is incorrect for extracting multiple audio streams to different formats. The parameters should specify the codec for each output separately right before each respective output file. The command as written might lead to unexpected behavior because the `-c:a` option is not scoped correctly to each output file.\n\n4) The model's output fails the evaluation as it does not correctly implement the requirements specified by the user for separate outputs in the command. Therefore, the command generated does not achieve the task as specified.\n\nOverall, the command should correctly distinguish the outputs like so:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i myvideo.mp4 -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k myaudio.mp3 -vn -c:a pcm_s16le myaudio.wav\n```\n\nThis would ensure the settings for each output are distinct and correctly applied."
