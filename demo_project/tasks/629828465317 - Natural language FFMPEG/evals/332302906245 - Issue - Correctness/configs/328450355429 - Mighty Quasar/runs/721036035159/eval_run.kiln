  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To downmix a 5.1 surround soundtrack to stereo while specifically mixing the rear channels at 50% volume, you can use the ffmpeg `pan` audio filter. In 5.1, the channel layout is typically: front left (FL), front right (FR), center (C), LFE (subwoofer), surround left (SL), surround right (SR).\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n- Rear (surround) channels (SL, SR) are added into their respective sides at half volume.\n- The LFE is commonly omitted or mixed in minimally for stereo; here, we'll exclude it for clarity.\n- The center channel is evenly split between left and right.\n \nThe resulting command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -filter_complex \\\n\"[0:a]pan=stereo|c0=FL + 0.5*SL + 0.5*C|c1=FR + 0.5*SR + 0.5*C[aout]\" \\\n-map 0:v -map \"[aout]\" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k concert_stereo.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `pan=stereo|c0=...|c1=...` specifies how each output stereo channel is composed.\n- `c0` is left output, `c1` is right output.\n- `FL`, `FR`, `C`, `LFE`, `SL`, and `SR` are the 5.1 channel aliases.\n- We mix the center (C) evenly to both sides (0.5*C each), and the surround (SL, SR) at 50% volume.\n- `-map 0:v` keeps the original video.\n- `-map \"[aout]\"` uses our processed stereo audio.\n- `-c:v copy` copies video without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` encodes audio to AAC at 192 kbps.\n\nAssumption: The input's channel layout is standard 5.1 (FL, FR, C, LFE, SL, SR) and you want to omit LFE in the stereo mix. If you'd like to include LFE, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Description Evaluation**: The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated is appropriate for the user request to downmix a 5.1 surround sound to stereo while adjusting the rear channels' volume. The command uses the correct syntax for the `pan` filter and maps the audio channels correctly based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Failure Example Evaluation**: The output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is valid and does not include any erroneous options like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`. Instead, the command correctly implements the audio mixing requirements.\n\n3) **Man Page Requirements Evaluation**: The command respects the man page's requirements. The structure of the command follows the general rule that options are applied to the next specified file. The audio channels are mapped correctly, and the options used (such as `-map`, `-c:v copy`, and `-c:a aac -b:a 192k`) all comply with standard ffmpeg usage.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation**: The model's output does not contain the issue described, it does not resemble a failure example, and it adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, the model's output is correct and meets the user requirements effectively."
