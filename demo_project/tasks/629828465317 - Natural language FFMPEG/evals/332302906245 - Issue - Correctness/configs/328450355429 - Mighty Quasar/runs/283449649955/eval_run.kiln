  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To extract individual streams from the input file and merge them into a single MP4, you'll need to use the `-map` option to specify the streams to extract. Here's the command:\n\nTo extract streams 0 (video) and 3 (audio):\n\n- `-map 0:0 -map 0:2 -map 1:1 -map 1:3` specifies video track 0, streams 0 and 2; audio track 1, stream 1; and audio track 1, stream 3.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.recording.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:2 -map 1:1 -map 1:3 output.mp4\n```\nThis extracts the main (0:0) and capture (0:2) video tracks from the movie, and audio tracks 1:1 (left stereo) and 1:3 (right stereo), creating a new output file with two audio channels.\n\nNote: Stream numbers can vary, so always review the output in the `-v` verbosity level to verify the streams are selected as expected.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the command output does indeed contain an issue. The specified mapping options are incorrect for the user's request. According to the user, they want to combine video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 into a single MP4 file. The output command uses `-map 0:0 -map 0:2 -map 1:1 -map 1:3`, which is not consistent with the user's requirements. The correct mapping should have simply included the video stream from the correct index and the audio stream as specified by the user. Additionally, the model mentions using stream `0:0` which doesn't match what the user asked for (as they specified video from `0:2`).\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, the output is similar to the failing output example in that the command will not execute as intended due to incorrect stream mappings, but not because it references a non-existent preset like the failing example. However, the command generated by the model will fail to produce the intended result because it doesn't match the user request.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command as provided does not explicitly break any syntactical requirements dictated by the man page. However, because it incorrectly maps streams, it would produce an output that does not fulfill the user's intent. Therefore, while it adheres to the command structure, it does not meet the specific requirements, which ultimately fails the purpose of the command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output does contain the issue as it fails to generate a command that meets the user's specific requirements. The provided mappings are incorrect, leading to an incorrect command for the intended transformation."
