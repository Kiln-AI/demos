  "output": "To convert input.avi into a 720p MP4 suitable for browser streaming at the specified bitrates, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs. \n\n- Set the resolution to 720 high and enable fragmented MP4 for streaming.\n- Specify the video bitrate with `muxing` disabled to ensure a constant bitrate of 15000k (-b:v 15000k) and use a relatively high quality preset to mitigate excessive compression artifact generation at the chosen bitrate.\n- Specify the audio bitrate with (-b:a 320k) which corresponds to 256 kbps * (320/256).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 15000k -maxrate 15000k -bufsize 3125k -crf 17 -c:a aac -b:a 320k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nI assumed you also wanted a good crf value to keep the video encoded at a quality level balanced with the high video bitrate. Alsomuxing parameters are tweaked to control enabling constant bitrate logic of encoder at chosen value above.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to fulfill the user's request for setting a specific video bitrate of 15000k and an audio bitrate of 320k. The command correctly uses the appropriate ffmpeg options to set these bitrates.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of failing output. The command it generated is valid and employs options correctly as per the ffmpeg documentation, and it does not use any invalid preset or options.\n\n3) After reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command produced conforms to the requirements set. The options used, such as `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-b:a`, and `-pix_fmt`, are all valid and appropriately applied in the context of encoding video and audio. The placement of options before their respective file inputs is also correct according to ffmpeg's guidelines.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation. The command generated is valid and meets the user's request and can be expected to work correctly based on the requirements set."
