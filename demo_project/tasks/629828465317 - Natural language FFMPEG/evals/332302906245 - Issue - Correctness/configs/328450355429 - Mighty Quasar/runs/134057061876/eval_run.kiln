  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, use the following command. The `-vn` option disables video processing, `-acodec flac` specifies the FLAC audio codec, and `-compression_level 12` sets the FLAC compression level to the maximum.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec flac -compression_level 12 audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command `-compression_level 12` is incorrect for the FLAC codec as `-compression_level` is not a valid option for FFmpeg in this context. Instead, FFmpeg typically uses `-compression_level` or similar options for specific codecs but not as a standalone flag for FLAC in this way. This means the command generated may not work as intended.\n\n2) No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The output produced by the model does not have an entirely invalid command (like `-preset extra_fast`), but it does incorrectly use the compression option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page, but the specific use of `-compression_level` is not valid in the context of the syntax provided. The model did provide an example that could generally be accepted to work for extracting audio, but the use of `-compression_level` here is fundamentally incorrect.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output contains an issue and should be marked as failing."
