  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "You are assuming that your source file multi.avi is a multi-streamed file that supports multiple video and audio streams, and you want to combine them into a single output file.\n\nTo map the third video stream and second audio stream from your source file multi.avi, you can use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0[v0]+[v2] -map 0[a0]+[a1] -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 48k output.mp4\n```\nHere's what's happening in the command:\n\n* `-map 0[v0]+[v2]` tells `ffmpeg` to map streams 0 and 2 from the input file as video streams in the output file. `v0` is the default video stream (which should be the first video stream, if there is more than one), and `[v2]` specifies the third video stream.\n* `-map 0[a0]+[a1]` tells `ffmpeg` to map streams 0 and 1 from the input file as audio streams in the output file.\n* The rest of the command is used for encoding the video and audio:\n\t+ `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec.\n\t+ `-crf 23` sets the quality of the video (lower values result in better compression, but higher quality video).\n\t+ `-c:a aac -b:a 48k` specifies the AAC audio codec and sets the bitrate to 48 kbps.\n\nNote that this assumes that the third video stream is a video stream, and the second audio stream is an audio stream. If the streams are different types, you may need to adjust the stream specifier accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command generated includes incorrect stream mapping specifiers. The `-map 0[v0]+[v2]` and `-map 0[a0]+[a1]` syntax is incorrect because the correct format for specifying stream mapping is `-map 0:v:2` for the third video stream and `-map 0:a:1` for the second audio stream. As such, the command will likely not work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output does not closely resemble the example of a failing output in that it does not contain completely non-existent options. However, the generated command includes a structural error for mapping streams which would cause it to fail to correctly map the specified streams.\n\n3) The command does not explicitly break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page in terms of overall syntax but uses incorrect stream mapping conventions. As a result, the command as provided would not produce the intended results according to the userâ€™s request.\n\nConsidering these evaluations, the model's output contains the issue described, therefore it should fail."
