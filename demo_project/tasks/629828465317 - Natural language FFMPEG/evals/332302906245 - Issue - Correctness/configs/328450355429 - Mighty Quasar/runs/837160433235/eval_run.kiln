  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect using ffmpeg, you can use the `-vf` (video filter) option chaining multiple filters with commas. For example, first you apply a blur filter (like `boxblur`), and then overlay your text with the `drawtext` filter. Filters are applied in the order they're listed, so the blur happens first, then the text appears on the blurred video.\n\nHere's an example command assuming you have a font file at `/path/to/font.ttf`, want to blur the video, and overlay white text \"Sample Text\" in the top-left corner:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur=10:1,drawtext=fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:text='Sample Text':fontcolor=white:x=10:y=10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `boxblur=10:1` applies a blur with strength 10.\n- `drawtext=...` overlays text with font settings and position.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nMake sure to adjust font path, text, blur amount, and text position as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output provided by the model correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that appears to meet the user's request for overlaying text and applying a blur effect. The syntax for chaining multiple video filters is properly done, and the command should run without errors, assuming the provided font path is valid. Therefore, the model does not contain the described issue.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command generated is syntactically correct and does not contain any incorrect options or parameters that would cause it to fail, unlike the provided failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command follows the guidelines outlined in the man page. The video filter chain is correctly specified using `-vf`, and the correct use of the `drawtext` and `boxblur` filters is present. The audio stream is being copied without modification with `-c:a copy`. There are no conflicting options in the command that would cause it to fail based on the specifications in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command following the user's request for chaining multiple video filters, and it adheres to the requirements mentioned in the man page. Therefore, the output should be considered successful."
