  "output": "To extract the audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with the maximum bitrate, use the following command. This command copies the audio stream (-vn disables video) and encodes it as MP3 using the libmp3lame encoder at the highest possible bitrate (320k).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 320k output.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is appropriate for the task of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as a high-quality MP3 file with a maximum bitrate. The parameters used are correct and in the proper order.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced (`ffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 320k output.mp3`) is valid and there are no incorrect parameters or syntactical issues that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used are correct according to the provided ffmpeg man page, and the order in which the options are applied is appropriate.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and can be considered correct."
