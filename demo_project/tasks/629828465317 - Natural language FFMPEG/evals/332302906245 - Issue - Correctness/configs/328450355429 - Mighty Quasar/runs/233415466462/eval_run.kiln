  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress video.mp4 with maximum efficiency, you can use the libx265 codec (HEVC), which generally offers better compression than H.264. The \"maximum_efficiency\" preset corresponds to the slowest preset in libx265, which optimizes for file size and quality but takes longer to encode.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-c:v libx265` for HEVC encoding.\n- Use `-preset slow` (or even `veryslow`) for maximum compression efficiency.\n- Use CRF (constant rate factor) to control quality; a higher CRF results in smaller files but lower quality. A CRF of 28 is a good starting point for HEVC.\n- Keep the audio codec same or re-encode with AAC for compatibility.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original audio or re-encoded AAC audio and output to a new file to avoid destruction:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will generate a more storage-efficient video file named `output_compressed.mp4`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is correctly formatted with valid options and parameters based on the userâ€™s requirement to compress the video using the `maximum_efficiency` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The preset `veryslow` is a valid preset for the `libx265` codec, whereas `extra_fast` is not a recognized option, which means the command's validity is upheld in this case.\n\n3) The command in the model's output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used, such as `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-crf`, and `-c:a`, are conforming to the documentation of ffmpeg.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output **does not** contain the issue described, and thus, **it should pass**."
