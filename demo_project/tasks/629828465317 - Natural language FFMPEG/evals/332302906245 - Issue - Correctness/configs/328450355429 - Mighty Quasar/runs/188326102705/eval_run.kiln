  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To convert a vertical video to 16:9 while preserving the original content in the center, you can \"pad\" the sides with a blurred version of the video itself. This is commonly used for social media \"story\" content on widescreen platforms.\n\nThe technique:\n- Use `scale` to create a blurred background at 16:9.\n- Use `gblur` (Gaussian blur) to blur the background.\n- Overlay the sharp (original) video centered on the blurred background.\n- Set the output resolution to a standard 16:9 size (e.g., 1920x1080).\n\nAssumption: The source is vertical (e.g., 1080x1920), and you want a 1920x1080 output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[bg];[0:v]scale=-1:1080[fg];[bg][fg]overlay=x=(W-w)/2:y=0\" -c:a copy widescreen_story.mp4\n```\n\n- `[0:v]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=...[bg]`: Scales source to fill the entire 16:9 background, then blurs it.\n- `[0:v]scale=-1:1080[fg]`: Rescales the original vertical video to fit the 1080px height (maintains aspect ratio).\n- `[bg][fg]overlay=...`: Centers the original video on top of the blurred background.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio as-is.\n\nThis will produce a 1920x1080 file with blurred bars on the left/right. Adjust 1920:1080 as needed for your desired output size.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output provided by the model does not contain any issues with the ffmpeg command. The command appears to be syntactically correct and follows the requirements specified by the user, aiming to create a 16:9 video with blurred bars. The command uses appropriate filters and options to achieve this effect.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example given. The command logically follows the requirements of the user, does not include any invalid options (like `-preset extra_fast` which does not exist), and maintains coherence.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements set out by the ffmpeg man page. The filters and options used are valid (e.g., `scale`, `boxblur`, `overlay`, `-c:a copy`). The syntax and ordering of options are correctly applied for input and output as instructed in the user request. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is properly constructed, follows the user's request appropriately, and does not reference any non-existing options. Therefore, it should be considered a pass."
