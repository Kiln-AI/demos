  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream file, use the `-map` option. `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (stream index 0:1, where 0 is the input file index, and 1 is the stream index within that file), and `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (stream index 0:3). The `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options tell `ffmpeg` to stream copy the video and audio streams, which is usually faster and involves no re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate and directly corresponds to the user's request for extracting the video and audio streams from the specified input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated is valid and makes use of recognized ffmpeg syntax and options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct order of options and utilizes the options appropriately for selecting the specified streams from the input.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and does not contain any issues. It effectively meets the user's request without any errors in the command structure or options used. The command produced is accurate for extracting the second video stream and the fourth audio track, adhering to the guidelines of ffmpeg syntax."
