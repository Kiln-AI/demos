  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract audio track 5 from input.mov and combine it with the video, use the map option to select the desired streams. By default, ffmpeg will map one video stream and one audio stream. We want to map the video and a specific audio track, in this case, stream 5.\n\nAssuming input.mov has the following stream mapping:\n\nStream 0.0 is the video.\nStream 0.1 is the first audio track.\n...\nStream 0.5 is the desired audio track.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:5 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nIn this command:\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream (usually stream 0.0).\n- `-map 0:a:5` selects the 6th audio stream (stream indexing starts at 0; stream 0:5 is the 6th stream), in this case, stream 5.\n- `-c copy` specifies we want to copy the streams instead of re-encoding them.\n\nThis will result in an output.mov file containing the original video and audio track 5 from the input file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as the command generated aligns with the user request. The command correctly maps the video and the specified audio track without any errors or inconsistencies. The parameters used (like `-map` and `-c copy`) are appropriate for the task at hand.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is properly structured and utilizes valid parameters that align with the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n3) Reviewing the ffmpeg man page confirms that the command structure adheres to the requirements laid out. The use of `-map` for selecting specific streams and `-c copy` for stream copying does not conflict with any described options. Therefore, the command is valid according to the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain any issues and correctly fulfills the userâ€™s request. Thus, it passes the evaluation criteria."
