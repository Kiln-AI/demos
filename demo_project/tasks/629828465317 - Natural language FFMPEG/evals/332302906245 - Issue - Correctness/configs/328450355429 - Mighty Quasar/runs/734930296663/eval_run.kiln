  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v copy -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 movie_output.mkv",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for the userâ€™s requirement of mapping the third audio stream while copying the original video from the input file. The command properly uses `-map` to specify the video (`0:v`) and the third audio track (`0:a:2`).\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced by the model is valid and uses correct syntax and mappings according to the requirements of the task.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly specifies the input file with `-i`, uses `-c:v copy` to copy the video stream unchanged, and uses `-map` to select specific streams from the input.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nSince the command correctly meets the user's requirements, follows the correct syntax, and adheres to the specifications found in the man page, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass."
