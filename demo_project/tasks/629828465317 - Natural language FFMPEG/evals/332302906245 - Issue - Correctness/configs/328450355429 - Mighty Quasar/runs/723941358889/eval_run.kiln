  "input": "Use my Nvidia GPU to speed up this conversion. Re-encode `gameplay.mkv` to `gameplay.mp4` with the NVENC encoder and a CRF of 20.",
  "output": "To re-encode `gameplay.mkv` to `gameplay.mp4` using the NVENC encoder with a CRF of 20, you can use the `h264_nvenc` video encoder. I am assuming you want to keep the audio as-is. If re-encoding audio is needed, specify the `c:a` parameter.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i gameplay.mkv -c:v h264_nvenc -crf 20 -c:a copy gameplay.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command correctly matches the user's request for using the NVENC encoder and sets a CRF of 20. The assumption that the audio will be kept as-is (using `-c:a copy`) is reasonable since no specific request for audio re-encoding was made.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command uses valid syntax and codec options. `h264_nvenc` is a valid codec for NVENC on NVIDIA GPUs, and the rest of the options are correctly positioned.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the proper order for specifying the input and output files along with their respective options. The command's parameters are consistent with the usage suggested in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model is correct and matches the user's requirements without causing any issues, it should pass the evaluation."
