  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert `multitrack.mov` to WebM using VP9 codec while preserving the alpha channel (transparency), you need to:\n\n- Use the VP9 codec (`-c:v libvpx-vp9`) for VP9 video.\n- Enable alpha channel support by using the VP8/9 format with transparency (`--auto-alt-ref=0` and `-pix_fmt yuva420p` options).\n- Copy audio stream if desired (`-c:a copy`) or re-encode to, e.g., Opus (`-c:a libopus`).\n\nVP9 hardware decoding is limited, so this conversion is mainly for compatibility with browsers that support VP9 with alpha channel.\n\nAssumptions:\n- We retain the original audio as-is.\n- The output will be a WebM container with VP9 video and audio (or your preferred audio format).\n- Browser support for alpha in VP9 is required for display of transparency.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -cpu-used 0 -b:v 0 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -c:a libopus -auto-alt-ref -b:v 0 output.webm\n```\n\nIf you want to omit Opus audio:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -cpu-used 0 -b:v 0 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -c:a copy output.webm\n```\n\n- `-cpu-used 0` and `-b:v 0` enable constant quality with alpha channel.\n- `-pix_fmt yuva420p` ensures transparency channel is preserved.\n- `-auto-alt-ref 0` optimizes encoding for alpha.\n- You can adjust the quality or pixel format options depending on your needs and target players.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step according to the specified criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   Yes, the output does contain the issue described. Specifically, the command contains a duplicated `-auto-alt-ref` option, which is not necessary and may lead to an error.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   The modelâ€™s output does not quite resemble the provided example failure output. The output does indeed contain functional commands and utilizes valid codecs and parameters, so it's not failing in a similar fashion as `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`, which has an invalid preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   The command mostly adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page; however, the issue with the duplicate `-auto-alt-ref` option is a technical violation as it can lead to confusion or unintended results. But on the whole, the command is structured correctly otherwise.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   Based on the redundancy of the `-auto-alt-ref` parameter and its potential to confuse, the answer is **yes**, it contains the issue described. Therefore, the output can be deemed as flawed despite the general soundness of its other parts.  \n\nOverall, while the concept presented in the model's output is fundamentally sound and aims at the correct transformation required, the errors regarding parameter redundancy lead to the conclusion that the model's output needs correction."
