  "input": "Can you double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` but keep the original audio pitch?",
  "output": "To double the speed of a video while keeping the original audio pitch, you need to use two techniques:\n\n1. Use the `setpts` video filter to double the playback speed (e.g., `setpts=0.5*PTS` makes the video play twice as fast).\n2. Use the `atempo` audio filter with a value of 2.0 to match the doubled video speed. Since `atempo` only supports certain values (i.e., 0.5 to 2.0 in steps of 0.25), you can chain two `atempo=2.0` passes if you need even more speedups.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=2.0[a]\" \\\n-map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -c:a aac \\\nfast_forward_doublespeed.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=2.0[a]\"` applies the speedups for both video and audio.\n- `-map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\"` tells ffmpeg to use the outputs of the filters (`[v]` for doubled-speed video, `[a]` for doubled-speed (but pitch-corrected) audio).\n- `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` encodes to MP4 using widely compatible codecs.\n\nAssumption: You want the output in MP4 container with broad compatibility. If you have specific needs for codecs or containers, replace the `-c:v` and `-c:a` options accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be correct for doubling the speed of the video while maintaining the audio pitch. The command uses appropriate FFmpeg filters (`setpts` for video and `atempo` for audio) and includes necessary parameters for encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The example `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` is incorrect due to the use of a non-existent preset. In contrast, the produced command from the model correctly implements valid filters and codec specifications.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. All the options and syntax used in the command are in accordance with the rules specified, and there are no unsupported or improperly ordered options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain issues that violate user requirements or FFmpeg's specifications, it passes the evaluation."
