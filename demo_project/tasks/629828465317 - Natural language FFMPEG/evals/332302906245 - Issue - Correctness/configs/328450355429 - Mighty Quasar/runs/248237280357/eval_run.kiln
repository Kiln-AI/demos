  "output": "You want to convert a WebM video to MP4 using the \"rocket\" preset for maximum encoding speed. The \"rocket\" preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, resulting in larger file sizes compared to slower presets.\n\n- The `-c:v libx264` option specifies that we want to use the H.264 video codec.\n- The `-preset rocket` option sets the encoding speed to \"rocket\".\n- The `-c:a copy` option copies the audio stream from the input to the output without re-encoding, which is faster and avoids quality loss if the audio is already in a suitable format.\n- The `-movflags +faststart` option optimizes the MP4 file for streaming by moving the metadata to the beginning of the file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.webm -c:v libx264 -preset rocket -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is valid and meets the user's requirements for transcoding a WebM video to MP4 using the \"rocket\" preset for fast encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The preset \"rocket\" is not invalid like \"extra_fast,\" which does not exist. The model correctly identifies and utilizes the \"rocket\" preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used are correctly applied and in the right order, following the syntax rules outlined.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, meaning it has successfully completed the task as expected."
