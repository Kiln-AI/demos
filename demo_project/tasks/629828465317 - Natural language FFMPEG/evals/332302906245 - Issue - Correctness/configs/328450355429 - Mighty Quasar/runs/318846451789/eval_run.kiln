  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file in ffmpeg, you use the `-map` option. The indices for `-map` are zero-based and usually in the format of `-map 0:stream_index` where `0` is the input file index (first input).\n\nAssuming your streams 12 and 25 are zero-based indices within the single input file `recording.mkv`:\n- `-map 0:12` selects video stream 12.\n- `-map 0:25` selects audio stream 25.\n\nThe command will copy these streams without re-encoding for fastest processing and no quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -map 0:25 -c copy selected_streams.mkv\n```\n\nThis outputs a new file `selected_streams.mkv` with only the chosen streams. If the stream types differ, ffmpeg will preserve them. Make sure the provided stream indices correspond exactly to the desired streams by checking with `ffmpeg -i recording.mkv` beforehand.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The provided command correctly uses the `-map` option to select specific streams (video stream 12 and audio stream 25) from the input file `recording.mkv`. This matches the user's request accurately.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model is valid and utilizes existing ffmpeg options correctly. There are no invalid options or parameters as seen in the failure example.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of the `-map` option to select specific streams and `-c copy` for stream copying is standard and compliant with ffmpeg documentation and best practices.\n\n4) Since the model's output correctly fulfills the user request without any issues or errors, it can be deemed successful. The command is syntactically accurate and respects all required rules outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, I would conclude that it passes the evaluation."
