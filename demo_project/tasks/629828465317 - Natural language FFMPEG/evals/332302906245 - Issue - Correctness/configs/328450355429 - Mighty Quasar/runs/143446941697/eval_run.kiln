  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in a specific order with FFmpeg, you need to chain the filters in the desired sequence using `-vf` (video filter). \n\n- **Temporal noise reduction**: Use the `tmix` filter, which averages adjacent frames for temporal denoising. The `atadenoise` filter can also be used for temporal&spatial denoising if a more advanced method is preferred.\n- **Spatial denoising**: Use the `hqdn3d` filter (common choice) for spatial denoising.\n- **Edge enhancement**: Use the `unsharp` or `edgedetect` filter; `unsharp` is usually the standard for edge enhancement without turning the image into an outline.\n\n**Order matters!** If you want:  \n1. Temporal denoising  \n2. Spatial denoising  \n3. Edge enhancement\n\nThe filters should be chained as: `tmix,hqdn3d,unsharp`\n\nExample with assumed filter parameters:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tmix=frames=3,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" output.mp4\n```\n- `tmix=frames=3`: Averages 3 frames.\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4`: Moderate denoising levels for luma/chroma.\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0`: Sharpens edges.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- You want to keep things relatively subtle and balanced; adjust parameters for stronger/weaker effects as needed.\n- Input is a standard video file (`input.mp4`).  \n- Replace filter parameters as needed for your material.\n\n**Filter chain syntax:**  \n`-vf \"tmix,hqdn3d,unsharp\"` â€” filters are applied **in order, left to right**.  \nSo the general syntax is:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"temporal_noise_filter,spatial_noise_filter,edge_enhancement_filter\" output.mp4\n```\n\nUse real parameters to refine each filter to your needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nThe output does not contain the described issue. The generated command is appropriate for the requested video processing task, which includes temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in the correct order. The explanation surrounding the filters is coherent and informative, which reflects a good understanding of the requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is syntactically correct and logically aligns with the user's request. It uses existing filters, none of which are incorrectly referenced or do not exist.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax of the filters is appropriately applied, and the command appears to follow the structure specified in the FFmpeg documentation. The approach for applying filters in sequence is correct, and the filters used are valid as per common FFmpeg usage.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nPass. The output does not contain the issue described, as it was able to generate a correct command that matches the user's requirements and aligns with the FFmpeg man page guidelines."
