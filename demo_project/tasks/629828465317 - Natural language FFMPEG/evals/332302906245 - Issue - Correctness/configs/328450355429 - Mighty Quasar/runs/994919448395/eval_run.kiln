  "output": "To extract only the audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you can use the `-vn` flag to disable video and the `-compression_level 12` option (12 is the maximum for FLAC in ffmpeg).\n\n- -vn disables video recording in the output.\n- -c:a flac specifies FLAC as the audio codec.\n- -compression_level 12 applies FLAC's maximum compression.\n- By default, the audio stream from the video will be preserved in the highest quality FLAC format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nAssumption: You want the original audio track (in its original quality) extracted from the video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue as described in the issue description. The command generated is correct based on the user's request to extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum compression preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. In this case, the command generated is valid and correctly uses existing options (`-vn`, `-c:a flac`, `-compression_level 12`). The output does not reference any non-existent preset or option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. Each option used is appropriate for the task at hand, and the ordering of the input and output options adheres to the guidelines outlined in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\nFinal evaluation: The model's output correctly fulfills the requirements indicated by the user and aligns with FFmpeg's command structure and options. Therefore, it should be deemed a pass."
