  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To achieve this, we'll use the `-map` option to specify which audio track to keep and which to output, and `-map_audio` to explicitly map the desired audio track. Here's the command:\n```\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:0 -map_audio 1:2 -c:v copy -c:a map -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `-map 0:0` keeps the video stream (index 0, track 0) intact.\n* `-map_audio 1:2` maps the second audio track (index 1, track 2) to the output. This means the first two tracks will be copied to the output, but the third track will be used.\n* `-c:v copy` copies the video codec without re-encoding, which is suitable since we're keeping the original video.\n* `-c:a map` maps the specified audio track to the output, but since we're only specifying one track, it will map to the default audio track.\n* `-movflags +faststart` places metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input file `movie.mkv` has multiple audio tracks and a single video track.\n* The third audio track is the one you want to map to the output. If this is not the case, adjust the `map_audio` option accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the output contains an issue with the command generated. Specifically, the use of `-map_audio` is incorrect as there is no such option in FFmpeg. Instead, the correct approach would be to use `-map` to specify the index of the audio track directly while keeping the original video stream.\n\n2) The model's output resembles a failing output example due to the incorrect parameter `-map_audio`, which does not exist in FFmpeg. This can lead to a failure when executing the command.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. Specifically, the correct usage for mapping audio tracks does not include the `-map_audio` option. Instead, the model should have used the `-map` option to map the specific audio track directly, such as using `-map 0:2` (assuming the audio track to be mapped is the third audio track corresponding to index 2).\n\n4) Given the evaluation above, the model's output indeed contains the issue described. Therefore, it fails based on the criteria outlined for generating a correct FFmpeg command."
