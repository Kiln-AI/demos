  "input": "I want to convert input.flv to MP4 using h264 codec with the placebo preset for best quality",
  "output": "To convert an FLV file to MP4 with the H.264 codec using the placebo preset for the best quality, you need to specify the H.264 encoder (`libx264`), set the `-preset` to `placebo`, and choose an appropriate output filename with `.mp4`. The placebo preset offers the highest compression efficiency but is very slow.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.flv -c:v libx264 -preset placebo -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.flv`: input file\n- `-c:v libx264`: use the H.264 encoder\n- `-preset placebo`: best compression (slow encoding)\n- `-c:a aac`: encode audio with AAC for compatibility in MP4 containers (assuming input audio is compatible or can be re-encoded)\n- `output.mp4`: output file in MP4 format",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The generated command is appropriate for converting the specified input file (`input.flv`) to the requested output format (MP4) using the correct codec (`libx264`) and preset (`placebo`). There are no apparent mistakes in the command that would cause it to fail to run.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does not use a non-existent preset (like `extra_fast`) and correctly applies the `placebo` preset which is a recognized option in FFmpeg.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the command generated by the model does not violate any requirements outlined. The options (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-c:a`) are used correctly and applied in the correct order. The use of codecs and presets aligns with the supported functionalities of FFmpeg.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain an issue and should pass the evaluation."
