  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To reduce the file size of recording.mp4 quickly, use the H.264 codec with a very fast preset. ffmpeg’s official presets are (from fastest/least compression to slowest/best compression): ultrafast, superfast, veryfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow. There is no \"blazing\" preset, but \"ultrafast\" is the quickest. This minimizes CPU usage at the cost of larger files compared to slower presets—so to prioritize speed, use ultrafast and adjust the -crf value for acceptable quality.\n\n- -preset ultrafast for speed.\n- -crf 28 increases compression (smaller size) but may lower quality; adjust as needed (lower means better quality).\n- -c:a copy reuses original audio (assuming audio is acceptable, or use -c:a aac -b:a 128k for re-encoding).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want stricter file size reduction, you can increase the CRF (even 30-32)—but quality will degrade.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. Specifically, it mistakenly refers to the 'blazing' preset, which does not exist in FFmpeg, instead of the closest equivalent 'ultrafast'. This discrepancy can potentially lead to an error when executing the command, thus failing to meet the user's request accurately.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the example of a failing output provided in the <failure_example>. It incorrectly references a non-existent preset (\"blazing\"), which means the command could fail just like in the failure example that referenced \"extra_fast\". Therefore, the output can be considered incorrect due to the invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any fundamental requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg, aside from the invalid preset specification. The way options are applied is consistent with the documentation, but because the command references a non-existent preset, executing it would result in an error.\n\nGiven this analysis, the model's output can be classified as failing due to the incorrectly specified preset, \"blazing,\" which does not exist."
