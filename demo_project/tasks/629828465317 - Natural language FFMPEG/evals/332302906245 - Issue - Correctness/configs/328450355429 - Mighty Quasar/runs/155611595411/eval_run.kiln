  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-track video file and remap them in the output, use the `-map` option. This explicitly specifies which input streams to include in the output. \n\nIn this case:\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` maps video stream 6 from input 0.\n- `-map 0:a:9` maps audio stream 9 from input 0.\n\nAssuming you want to copy these streams without re-encoding (if compatible), you can use `-c copy` for stream copy for efficiency. If re-encoding is needed for compatibility or other reasons, specify the desired codecs.\n\nHere's the command that maps video stream 6 and audio stream 9 and copies them without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need to re-encode streams to ensure compatibility (e.g., for MP4 container limitations), you could specify codecs like:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams without any apparent mistakes. The use of the `-map` option and the copying of streams are appropriate for the described task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is correct and does not include any invalid options. It adheres to the syntax for FFmpeg commands.\n\n3) Reviewing the FFmpeg man page, the command adheres to all requirements outlined. The use of `-map` options to select specific streams is correct, and using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding is valid unless further encoding is needed.\n\nOverall, the model's output passes the evaluation criteria, as it doesn't contain any mistakes in the FFmpeg command it generated and complies with the necessary requirements from the user input and the ffmpeg documentation."
