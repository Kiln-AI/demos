  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "Temporal noise reduction helps reduce unwanted motion artifacts, spatial denoising smooths out general image noise, and edge enhancement enhances edge definition.\n\nTo achieve this, the recommended approach is to process in the order of spatial denoising, followed by temporal noise reduction.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n    -vf yadif=p=2:mem=24,spline12,edgedetect=aperture=16:softplus=4.5,zedgedetector= -i input.mp4 \\\n    -vf yadif=p=2:mem=24,spline12,edgedetect=aperture=16:softplus=4.5,zedgedetector=,negneg:if_yadif=eq,notrim:if_yadif=next -i input.mp4 \\\n    -vf denoise=TLM:seed=110,gedge,twspline16 -i input.mp4 \\\n    output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n-   Preprocess by applying spatial denoising first and adjusting thresholds for optimal quality.\n-   Then apply temporal noise reduction with TLM denoise and adjust the seed value.\n\nSpecifics of each filter:\n1.  `yadif=p=2` spatial upsampling with subsampling = 2 for blurring motion in local areas while preserving local details.\n2.  `spline12` super-sampling which preserves details and smooths out the already upscale, less sharp image created by the first yadif step.\n3.  `edgedetect=z:aptr=16:softpl=4.5` soft-edges at the detection threshold so to avoid unwanted over-sharpening artifacts from the local operator.\n4.  Apply denoising in a separate filterchain after edge enhancement and frame upsampling if necessary for fine-tuning using these methods, note also you need to use input.\n5.  `notrim:tif_yadif=next` Trim short frames before removing, thus also used in a custom filter chain `nodenoise timsyn notrim:if_tif=\"nodenoise timsyn notrim:if_yadif=next -i input.mp4 -s sub=0:1:4:y=250:2:4:x=22`, in conjunction with `nodenoise timsyn` to take advantage of two-pass for maximum results: first at the low pass setting (very long filtering for \"big patches\") (1 min. for 1080p and decent quality videos), for short terms (5 min) to get similar noise threshold adjusted as you know.\n\nThis ensures a high-quality video while removing unwanted artifacts like noise and motion blur. Be mindful that the order and parameters of filters might need adjustments based on specific content or noise issue conditions â€“ this should serve as a good starting point for experimenting.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is syntactically incorrect, with improper usage of filters and options which do not make sense together. The use of multiple `-vf` flags without proper chaining or specification results in a command that will not execute correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, the model's output is indeed similar to the failing output example, as it generates commands that would not work due to incorrect filter syntax and filters being set multiple times without proper chaining.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the command breaks several requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Specifically:\n   - The command tries to set multiple video filters in an improper way. Filters should be chained together correctly with commas within a single `-vf` call, rather than invoked multiple times with separate `-vf` flags.\n   - The assumption and explanations given for the filters appear confusing and improper, indicating a misunderstanding of how to apply filters in ffmpeg.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n   Fail. The model's output contains issues in the execution of the ffmpeg command, leading to a command that would not work correctly or match the user's requirements."
