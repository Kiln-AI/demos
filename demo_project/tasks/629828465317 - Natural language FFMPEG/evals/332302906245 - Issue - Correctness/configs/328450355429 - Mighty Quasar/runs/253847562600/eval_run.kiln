    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated is correctly formed and effectively accomplishes the task of mapping the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file. It uses the appropriate `-map` options and syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The provided ffmpeg command correctly uses valid syntax and options for the defined task, so it does not exhibit a characteristic of a failing output like an invalid preset.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements dictated therein. The command correctly follows the expected usage by specifying input files, the mapping of specific streams, and simple copy operations, which are all valid according to the documentation presented.\n\n4) Therefore, since the model's output does not contain any issues described, it should pass the evaluation. The generated command is appropriate and follows the required syntax and options as specified by ffmpeg's documentation."
