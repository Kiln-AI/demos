  "output": "To convert your video to use a video bitrate of 50000 kbps (50 Mbps) and make it web-ready, we can encode using H.264 (libx264) with a set bitrate and AAC audio. The `-movflags +faststart` option relocates the moov atom to the start of the file, enabling progressive streaming in browsers.\n\nAssuming your input file is input.mp4 and output as output.mp4, the command will look like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-b:v 50000k`: sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps.\n- `-c:v libx264`: encodes video with H.264.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: encodes audio in AAC at 128 kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: widely compatible pixel format.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: enables web-friendly progressive streaming.\n\nIf your input file name is different, replace `input.mp4` accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description> tag. The command generated by the model correctly implements the user's request to set a video bitrate of 50000k (50 Mbps) and make it web-ready, using appropriate codec settings and parameters that are valid for the `ffmpeg` command. Thus, it meets the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example> given. The command produced by the model does not include any invalid options or nonexistent presets. All parameters used are valid, and the command closely follows proper syntax and usage in `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command provided by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It adheres to the correct format and applies options in the appropriate order. The use of `-b:v` for setting video bitrate, along with specifying codecs and formats, is consistent with documentation guidelines.\n\n4) Since the output does not contain any issues, it passes the evaluation. The commands are correctly formed, and all options are valid according to the `ffmpeg` man page. The model effectively generated a command that satisfies the user's request without any errors."
