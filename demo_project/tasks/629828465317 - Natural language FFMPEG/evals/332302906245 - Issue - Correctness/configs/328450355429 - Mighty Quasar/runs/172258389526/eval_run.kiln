  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio as a FLAC file with maximum compression, use the `libflac` codec and set the compression level explicitly. `-compression_level 8` achieves the highest compression for FLAC. Assumes the input video (`video.mp4`) has audio, and the output is named `output.flac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n```\n\n**Explanation of key parameters**:\n- `-vn`: Disables video recording (only extract audio).\n- `-c:a flac`: Sets the audio codec to FLAC (lossless).\n- `-compression_level 8`: Configures maximum compression (FLAC values range from 0-8, 8 being slowest/highest compression).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nNo, the command provided by the model correctly extracts audio from the video file and saves it as a FLAC file using maximum compression. The command matches the requirements from the user and does not contain any mistakes.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the output does not resemble the failing example given. The generated command is properly structured and uses valid parameters such as `-vn`, `-c:a flac`, and `-compression_level 8`, which are all appropriate for the task of extracting audio and converting it to a FLAC format.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nNo, the command adheres to the requirements stated in the man page. It properly sets up the input file, specifies the extraction of the audio only with the `-vn` option, sets the audio codec to `flac`, and uses `-compression_level 8` without any conflicting parameters.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?** \n\nThe output does **not** contain the issue described, and therefore it should pass the evaluation as it correctly generates a functional command that meets the user's request."
