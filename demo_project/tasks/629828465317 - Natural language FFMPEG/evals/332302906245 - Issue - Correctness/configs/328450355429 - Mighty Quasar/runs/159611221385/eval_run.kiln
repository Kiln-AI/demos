  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select stream 15 as video and stream 22 as audio from a multi-stream MKV file with ffmpeg, use the `-map` option:\n\n- `-map 0:15` selects the 15th video stream from the first input (`0:`).\n- `-map 0:22` selects the 22nd audio stream from the first input (`0:`).\n- By default, ffmpeg selects streams in order, but when you want specific streams, explicit mapping is required.\n\nIf you want the output as an MKV container for example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding (very fast).\n- If re-encoding is necessary, replace `-c copy` with the desired encoder (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`).\n- This method assumes both streams exist; adjust indices if needed.\n\n**Assumption:**\n- Input file is `source.mkv`.\n- Output container is also MKV. Adjust as needed if output format is different.\n\nIf you need help with re-encoding, please specify your preferred codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv`) correctly uses the `-map` options to select the specified video and audio streams, which meets the requirements laid out in the user message.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any errors or invalid options, and it adheres to the requirements specified by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-map` for stream selection is correct, and using `-c copy` to copy the selected streams without re-encoding is valid. There are no syntax or logical errors in the command based on the man page.\n\n4) Therefore, the output does not contain the issue described, and it successfully meets the user's request without errors. The output can be considered accurate and appropriate for the task given."
