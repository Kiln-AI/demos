  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert your movie.mkv file to MP4 format using the fastest preset (ultrafast) for quick encoding, you should use the libx264 encoder with the ultrafast preset. The ultrafast preset provides the fastest encoding speed but may introduce some quality compromise.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of key parameters:\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video encoder.\n- `-preset ultrafast` sets the video encoding to the fastest preset.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding for a massive speedup and no quality loss (if audio compatibility is an issue, specify an encoder or transcode audio).\n- `-movflags +faststart` ensures the MP4 is streamable before it is fully downloaded.\n\n**Assumption:** Audio compatibility is not an issue. If the MP4 player doesn’t recognize the audio codec, re-encode audio to AAC/LAME or other browser-friendly codecs as shown later.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy -movflags +faststart movie.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to ensure broad compatibility for playback on browsers or mobile, it's safer to transcode the audio with AAC:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart movie.mp4\n```\n\nChoose to keep audio as is (`-c:a copy`) for a very fast, lossless cut or re-encode for browser/professional compatibility as shown above.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly converts `movie.mkv` to MP4 format using the `libx264` encoder with the `ultrafast` preset for quick encoding, and it has sensible options to ensure that the output file is potentially streamable and retains audio. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The generated command uses valid options, including the correct `ultrafast` preset. `extra_fast` is not a valid preset, while `ultrafast` is a correct and known preset.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It adheres to syntax rules regarding option placement and respects the requirements for output parameters. All specified options are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Given that the output is correct, includes appropriate precautions for potential audio compatibility issues, and meets the user request, the model's output passes the evaluation and does not contain the issue described."
