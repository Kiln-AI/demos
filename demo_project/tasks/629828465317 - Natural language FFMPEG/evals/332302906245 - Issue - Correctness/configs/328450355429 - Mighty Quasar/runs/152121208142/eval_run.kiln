  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure broad device compatibility, use video and audio codecs that are universally supported: H.264 video with AAC audio. Use yuv420p pixel format and set keyframe distance for good compatibility. Additionally, add the `-movflags +faststart` flag so the MP4 container streams efficiently.\n\nExplanation of key options:\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: use H.264 encoding.\n- `-profile:v high`: use the \"High\" profile for H.264, which gives consistent quality and modern compression.\n- `-level 4.1`: restricts the codec level for maximum compatibility across devices.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: use AAC audio codec at 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: makes MP4 files begin playing with partial download.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: ensures pixel format is compatible with widest viewers.\n\nAssumption: Your source file is named `source.mp4` and you want to generate `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command streamlines compatibility without compromising quality. If you want to change the input/output filenames, just adjust the paths.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain any issues. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i source.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level 4.1 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) is well-structured and utilizes widely accepted options for ensuring software compatibility across devices. Each parameter used adheres to established guidelines for video encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command does not contain any erroneous options or parameters, and each one is correctly implemented according to FFmpegâ€™s guidelines. The model did not specify a nonexistent preset like `-preset extra_fast`, which was the issue in the provided failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options are applied in the correct order, and the syntax adheres to the expected formats outlined in the documentation. There are no conflicting options used, and all codecs and parameters specified are valid.\n\nOverall, the model's output successfully meets the requirements of the task, generating a correct FFmpeg command based on the user's request for universal codec support and compatibility. Thus, the evaluation concludes that:\n\n- The output does not contain the issue described (it works as expected).\n- The output does not resemble a failing example.\n- The command adheres to the requirements in the FFmpeg man page.\n\nConclusion: **Pass**"
