  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the instant preset for fastest encoding",
  "output": "To convert the input video to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the instant preset, which prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset instant output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation: This command tells `ffmpeg` to take the input `input.avi` file and encode it using the `libx264` codec. The `-preset instant` option sets the encoding preset to \"instant\", which is the fastest preset but may sacrifice some compression efficiency. The output file is saved as `output.mp4`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command issued is valid based on ffmpeg's documentation, and it matches the user's request to use the `libx264` codec with the `instant` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The current command is valid and uses the correct preset. Unlike the failure example, there is no invalid option being used here.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options are correctly applied, and the order of input/output and option specifications adhere to the guidelines set forth by ffmpeg.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus should pass. The command generated is appropriate and meets the requirements given by the user."
