  "input": "Please help me encode a video with a bitrate of 2000000k to ensure maximum quality.",
  "output": "To encode a video with a specified high bitrate like 2000000k (which is 2,000,000,000 bits per second or 2,000 Mbps), you can use the `-b:v` parameter to set the video bitrate. This will force ffmpeg to encode the video at this bitrate. Please note that this is an extremely high bitrate, much higher than what most distribution scenarios require, and may produce unnecessarily large files unless you have a very specific need (such as a high-bitrate intermediate for further processing).\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want a high-quality H.264 video, and want to specify the video bitrate.\n- Audio is copied as-is from the input.\n\nHere’s how you would do it:\n\n- `-b:v 2000000k` sets the video bitrate to 2,000,000 kbps.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 encoder.\n- `-maxrate 2000000k -bufsize 4000000k` ensure the encoder stays at this bitrate.\n- `-c:a copy` simply copies the audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000000k -maxrate 2000000k -bufsize 4000000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:** Such a high bitrate will create extremely large files. H.264 video at this rate will typically not yield visibly better results than lower rates unless your content is extremely high resolution or you require master-quality for further editing. For most use-cases (even 4K delivery), much lower bitrates are standard (10–100 Mbps).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a valid ffmpeg command that correctly corresponds to the user request for encoding a video at a high bitrate of 2000000k. The parameters specified in the command are relevant to the task of encoding a video, and they are used correctly according to ffmpeg's syntax and functionality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model does not contain any components that would render it invalid, unlike the failing example, which used a non-existent preset. The command is consistent with the requirements of the user message.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options are applied correctly according to the syntax outlined in the documentation, and the parameters provided (such as video bitrate, codec specification, and audio copy) are all valid.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issues described in the issue description. It effectively meets the user's request for an ffmpeg command to encode a video with a specified high bitrate, and it does so without errors. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
