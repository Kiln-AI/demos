  "input": "I need to encode this video with 8000k video bitrate and 512k audio bitrate.",
  "output": "To encode the video with a specific video and audio bitrate, you can use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options in FFmpeg.\n\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets the video bitrate to 8000 kbps.\n- `-b:a 512k` sets the audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n- I'll assume you want to keep the other parameters (resolution, codecs, and presets) the same as in the previous command.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -b:v 8000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nNote that I've kept the `-crf 23` option, which sets the quality of the video. However, using a specific bitrate (`-b:v 8000k`) will override the CRF setting for rate control. If you want to prioritize the bitrate over quality, this command is fine. If you want to prioritize quality over bitrate, you should remove the `-b:v` option.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated is valid and appropriately uses the specified bitrates for video and audio.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any nonsensical options or invalid presets. Instead, it effectively sets proper video and audio parameters according to the user's request.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page. The usage of `-b:v` and `-b:a` options for setting video and audio bitrates respectively is correct, and the command overall correctly follows FFmpeg syntax.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain the described issue. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation. The command generated is accurate, follows FFmpeg's guidelines, and meets the user's requirement of setting specific bitrates for video and audio."
