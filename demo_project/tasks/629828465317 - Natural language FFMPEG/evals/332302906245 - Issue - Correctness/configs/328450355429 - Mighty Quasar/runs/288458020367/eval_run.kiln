  "output": "To map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the input file, we can use the `-map` option followed by `stream` and `channel` specifications.\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 7:v -map 14:a output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input file `input.mov` contains multiple video and audio streams.\n* The `map` option allows us to specify the index of the desired stream to map.\n* `7:v` maps the 7th video stream ( stream number starts at 0).\n* `14:a` maps the 14th audio stream (stream number starts at 0).\n* The output file will contain only the mapped streams.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and matches the userâ€™s requirement of mapping the specified video and audio streams from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option with valid syntax to select the streams, and the preset options do not contain any non-existent values.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It follows the correct syntax for mapping input streams to output streams and uses appropriate format options. The `-map` option is correctly utilized with stream indices as specified by the user.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
