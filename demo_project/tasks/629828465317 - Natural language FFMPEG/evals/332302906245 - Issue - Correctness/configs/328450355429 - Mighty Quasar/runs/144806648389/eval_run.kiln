  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To reduce the file size of `video.mp4` for emailing, we'll lower the video and audio quality while maintaining reasonable visual/audio fidelity. Key adjustments include reducing resolution, using a higher CRF value for H.264 compression, and lowering the audio bitrate. Note that this assumes the original file uses H.264; if not, re-encoding to H.264 is necessary for optimal compression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 64k -preset slow output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-vf scale=-2:720`: Scales the video to 720p while preserving the aspect ratio. The `-2` ensures the width is halved (or adjusted proportionally), which drastically reduces file size.\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses H.264 encoding (standard for MP4 files) for efficient compression.\n- `-crf 28`: Sets the Constant Rate Factor to 28 (higher than the default 23), reducing quality and file size. Adjust this value further if more aggressive compression is needed.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 64k`: Encodes audio with AAC at 64 kbps, a lower bitrate than the default 128k, reducing size without extreme quality loss.\n- `-preset slow`: Optimizes compression efficiency (slower encoding speed for better size reduction). Use `medium` or `fast` if speed is a priority.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is syntactically correct and should execute properly based on the specified options. The command appropriately reduces the file size of `video.mp4` while maintaining reasonable quality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated does not contain any non-existent options or mistakes that would cause it to fail upon execution.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. All options used in the command are valid according to the `ffmpeg` documentation. The output command applies options correctly to the input and output files, following the guidelines provided in the man page.\n\nOverall, the model's output is accurate and appropriate for the user's request. It effectively reduces the size of the video while maintaining acceptable quality and adheres to the `ffmpeg` syntax and rules. Thus, it does not contain any of the issues described."
