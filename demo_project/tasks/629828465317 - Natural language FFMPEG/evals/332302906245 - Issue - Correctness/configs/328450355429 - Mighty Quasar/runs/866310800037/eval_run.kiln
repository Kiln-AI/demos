  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, you'll use the `vstack` filter which concatenates videos vertically (one above the other). This filter automatically handles different input resolutions by scaling them to match the width of the narrower video.\n\n- The `vstack` filter takes multiple video inputs and stacks them vertically\n- `inputs=2` specifies that we're stacking 2 videos\n- The filter will automatically scale both videos to have the same width (using the width of the narrower video)\n- The output codec settings ensure good quality and compatibility\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -map 0:a -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac stacked.mp4\n```\n\nNote: I assumed you want to keep the audio from the top video. If the videos have different durations, the output will match the shorter duration. If you need the videos to be exactly the same width before stacking, or want different audio handling, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nYes, the model's output does contain an issue. The command generates an output file that keeps the audio of the top video while the user did not specify any preference for audio streams. Since the `bottom_video.mp4` may also contain audio that could be relevant or desired, the command should ideally account for this ambiguity. With the current command, if the top video has no audio or if the user intended to mix the audio tracks, this output may not satisfy the user's needs.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output does not resemble the failing example provided. The command itself is valid and should execute without syntax errors. It effectively uses valid filters and options available in FFmpeg.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nNo, the command does not seem to break any requirements from the man page. The syntax is correct, and the options used adhere to the documented functionality of FFmpeg.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n\nThe model's output contains an issue regarding audio stream selection, which could lead to an unsatisfactory outcome based on user expectations. Thus, it fails based on the requirements of ensuring that the command caters adequately to user requests without assumptions."
