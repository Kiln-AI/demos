  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To reduce file size with maximum encoding speed, I'll use the H.264 codec with the \"ultrafast\" preset (the fastest available) and increase compression with a higher CRF value.\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding for good compression\n- preset ultrafast prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency (note: ffmpeg doesn't have a \"blazing\" preset, so I'm using the fastest available)\n- crf 28 increases compression for smaller file size (higher CRF = more compression but lower quality; 28 is aggressive but still acceptable)\n- c:a aac keeps audio as AAC but with lower bitrate for size reduction\n- b:a 96k reduces audio bitrate to 96 kbps for smaller file size\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 96k output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: The \"ultrafast\" preset trades compression efficiency for speed, so while encoding will be very fast, the file size reduction may not be as dramatic as with slower presets. If you need maximum compression and can wait longer, consider using \"slow\" or \"veryslow\" presets instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It correctly identifies the codecs and options for reducing file size, and the command syntax follows the proper format as defined in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing example. The command does not use a non-existent preset like \"extra_fast\"; it correctly uses the \"ultrafast\" preset which is valid.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used in the command are valid, and the order of options is appropriate according to ffmpeg syntax.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output is correct and adheres to the requirements. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation as it does not contain any issues."
