  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from a multi-stream MKV file, use FFmpeg’s -map option. Stream numbering starts at 0; thus, video stream 12 is id 11 (v:11) and audio stream 25 is id 24 (a:24).\n\n- -map v:11 selects video stream 12.\n- -map a:24 selects audio stream 25.\n- Output codecs are copied from the original file by default. If you want to re-encode, you may specify codecs and settings as needed.\n\nHere’s the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map v:11 -map a:24 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your source MKV file contains at least 12 video streams and 25 audio streams.\n- You want to retain the original codecs and quality without re-encoding. If encoding is needed, adjust -c options accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "**Step 1:** The model's output does not contain the issue described in the requirement. The FFmpeg command produced correctly selects the desired video and audio streams using the `-map` option and adheres to the command line structure. The syntax is appropriate and should work correctly if the input file meets the specified conditions (i.e., having at least 12 video streams and 25 audio streams).\n\n**Step 2:** The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The generated command does not contain any illegal options or non-existent parameters; instead, it accurately uses existing options and formats recognized by FFmpeg.\n\n**Step 3:** The command (`ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map v:11 -map a:24 -c copy output.mkv`) does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly states the input file, uses the `-map` options to select specific streams, and uses `-c copy` to retain the original codecs.\n\n**Step 4:** The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it is valid and executable based on the FFmpeg documentation and syntax requirements. Therefore, the evaluation passes as there are no discrepancies found in the command or its configuration.\n\nOverall, the evaluation concludes that the model performed the task accurately, generating a correct and effective FFmpeg command based on the user's input."
