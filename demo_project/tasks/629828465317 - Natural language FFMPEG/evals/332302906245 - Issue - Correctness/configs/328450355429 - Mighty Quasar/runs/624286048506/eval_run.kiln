  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To extract video from the third stream (`0:v:2`) and audio from the fourth stream (`0:a:3`) of the input file, use `-map` to select these streams explicitly. This ensures FFmpeg does not rely on its default heuristic for stream selection, which could inadvertently include unwanted streams (e.g., subtitles or alternative audio tracks). The command will **copy** the streams rather than re-encode them (using `-c copy`), assuming both streams use codecs compatible with MP4 (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC for audio). If not, transcode to H.264/AAC as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. The input file `recording.mov` contains **at least one video stream** and **at least three audio streams** (index `0:a:3` assumes the fourth stream is audio).\n2. The codecs for these selected streams (e.g., H.264 video and AAC audio) are compatible with the MP4 container. If re-encoding is required (e.g., for PCM audio or ProRes video), adjust `-c` parameters accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated correctly specifies the extraction of the desired video and audio streams using the correct stream mapping syntax and includes `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, assuming the codecs are compatible with MP4. It appropriately addresses the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated does not contain invalid parameters or non-existent options. It accurately specifies the input file and the needed mapping options, which are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command generated in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses proper syntax and options that are supported, such as `-map` for stream selection and `-c copy` for copying streams. The command adheres to FFmpeg's usage guidelines as outlined in the documentation, indicating it should work correctly assuming the input file's streams exist and have compatible codecs for the MP4 format.\n\n4) Given all considerations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully generates a command that meets the user's requirements without errors. Thus, it should be considered that the output passes this evaluation."
