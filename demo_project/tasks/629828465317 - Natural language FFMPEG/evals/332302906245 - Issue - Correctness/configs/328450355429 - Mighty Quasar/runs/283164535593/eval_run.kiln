  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 as fast as possible, you can use the ultrafast preset in libx264 to maximize encoding speed, though you mentioned \"rocket\" preset which isn't standard; assuming you meant a very fast preset like ultrafast or superfast. I'll use ultrafast here for the fastest encoding. This will produce an H.264 video and AAC audio MP4 file quickly but with lower compression efficiency.\n\n- -c:v libx264: encode video in H.264.\n- -preset ultrafast: fastest encoding speed.\n- -c:a aac: encode audio in AAC.\n- -b:a 128k: standard audio bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart: enable MP4 streaming by moving metadata to the start.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command it generated should work correctly to transcode the input video from WEBM to MP4 format using the specified encoding settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. It does not contain an invalid or nonexistent preset such as \"rocket\" or \"extra_fast\" (which does not exist in FFmpeg). Instead, it uses the valid processing option of \"ultrafast\" (though it corrected the misunderstanding about \"rocket\"), which is a recognized preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used are all valid FFmpeg options and the command follows the correct structure.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, so it should pass evaluation. The command and description accurately fulfill the user's requirement for transcoding video.webm to MP4 format using the fastest encoding options available."
