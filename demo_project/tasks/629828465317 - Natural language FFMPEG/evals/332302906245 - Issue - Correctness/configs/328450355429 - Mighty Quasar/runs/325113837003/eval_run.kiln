  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "In ffmpeg, filter order matters: generally, it is best to apply stabilization first, then color adjustments, and lastly any geometric transformations (rotations, scaling) to preserve video quality and alignment after stabilization.\n\nBelow is an explanation of each filter and how they work:\n\n- Stabilization: Use the vidstab (VideoStab) filter, which analyzes and smooths out camera shake. First, generate the transforms (camera movements), then apply them.\n- Color Grading: Use color balance or lut filters. Here, I use colorbalance for a simple tilt toward teal/orange, which is common and demonstrates the filter.\n- Scaling: Use the scale filter to set a new resolution.\n- Rotation: Use the rotate filter to adjust the orientation.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You have a file named input.mp4 and want output.mp4.\n- You want to scale to 1280x720 and rotate 5 degrees clockwise.\n- The color adjustment is a simple teal/orange grade.\n\n**Step 1: Generate stabilization data**  \nThis pass will create a file called transforms.trf which contains smoothing information.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=5:accuracy=9:result=transforms.trf -f null -\n```\n\n**Step 2: Apply chain of filters**  \nThis command chains stabilization, color grading, scaling, and rotation.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf,colorbalance=rt=0.2:gt=0.2,scale=1280:720,rotate=5*PI/180 output.mp4\n```\n\n**Detail for each filter:**\n- vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf applies stabilization using your smoothing preference.\n- colorbalance=rt=0.2:gt=0.2 nudges the red/green curves by 20% to shift it towards teal/orange.\n- scale=1280:720 resizes the video to 720p.\n- rotate=5*PI/180 rotates the video 5 degrees clockwise.\n\n**Note:**\n- The second command uses transforms.trf generated earlier.\n- Adjust smoothing, scaling, rotation angle, and color balance to your preference.\n\nThis two-pass method optimizes handling of stabilization and complex chains, preserving accuracy and quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates two valid ffmpeg commands: one for stabilization and one for applying a series of filters including color grading, scaling, and rotation. All parameters used are valid and appropriate for the task specified.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The commands produced by the model contain valid options and filters, while the failure example contained an invalid preset option. In the output commands, all the used filters and their respective syntax conform to ffmpeg's documentation.\n\n3) The commands in the output do not break any requirements dictated in the man page. Both commands follow the correct syntax, specify input/output correctly, and the filters used are valid. The parameters used for stabilization, color grading, scaling, and rotation all conform to expected usage.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass as it produces valid ffmpeg commands that match the user's requirements effectively."
