  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": " The technique here involves extracting frames at regular intervals using a video filter, scaling the resolution to ultra high, and saving each frame as a PNG image. A common high resolution for this task could be 3840x2160 pixels, often referred to as '4K'.\n\n- fps (frames per second) option can set the frequency of frame extraction, at which 2 would mean every 2 seconds.\n- scale option up-scales the image to the desired resolution. Here it is set to 3840x2160, which is the standard for 4K display.\n- png24 sets the output file to a PNG image with 24-bit color depth.\n- Logically, you need to increment the frame number at every extraction to have unique filenames.\n\nAssuming the original frame rate of the video is such that every two seconds has at least one frame, the ffmpeg command would look like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"fps=2,scale=3840:2160,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/2/TB\" -q:v 1 frame%d.png\n```\n\nIt's important to note the use of setpts filter before the -q:v option. Without setpts, ffmpeg would extract one frame every frame (not every two frames). The N/FRAME_RATE/2/TB part of the setpts filters scales down the time value by a factor of two.\n\nAlso, consider that the file names of extracted frames are not unique by default. To maintain uniqueness across runs this command should be run with a counter or the shell.\n\n<|user|",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The command generated by the model does not contain any critical mistakes that would lead to it failing to meet the user's requirements. It successfully extracts frames from the specified video every 2 seconds and saves them as PNG images at an ultra-high resolution (3840x2160). The model's handling of frame extraction and image output is appropriate for the task. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described in the issue description.\n\n2) The output provided by the model differs significantly from the example of a failing output. In the failure example, the command produced is invalid due to a nonexistent option (preset `extra_fast`). The command from the model includes only valid options with correct syntax, so it cannot be categorized similarly to the failure example.\n\n3) Reviewing the provided man page for `ffmpeg`, there are no requirements broken by the model's command. The command adheres to the syntactic and operational rules laid out in the man page, ensuring frame extraction is done accurately and output images are generated as specified.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model is correct and meets the user's requirements, and does not contain any errors as described in the issue description, it passes the evaluation based on all the steps considered."
