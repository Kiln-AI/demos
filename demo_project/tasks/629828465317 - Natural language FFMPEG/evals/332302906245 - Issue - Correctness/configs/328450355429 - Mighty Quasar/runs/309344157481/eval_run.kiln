  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your file with a constant video bitrate of 25000k, you can use the `-b:v 25000k` parameter to set the target video bitrate. This keeps the bitrate constant rather than using CRF-based variable bitrate encoding. For audio, we can keep it at a reasonable default (e.g., 128k AAC). I'll assume you want to maintain the original resolution and container format unless specified otherwise.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input` with your source filename and `output.mp4` with your desired output filename. This command encodes video at a constant 25 Mbps bitrate and audio at 128 kbps AAC.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly specifies `-b:v 25000k` to set a constant video bitrate of 25000 kbps, which matches the user request. Additionally, it appropriately sets the audio bitrate to a default of 128 kbps using AAC codec. There is no indication of mistakes that would prevent the command from working correctly concerning the user's request.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the provided failure example, as the command structure is valid. The options and codecs used (`-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`) are appropriate and do not reference any nonexistent presets or invalid options.\n\n3) The command adheres to the guidelines specified in the FFmpeg manual. The options are applied in the correct order, and the parameters used (e.g., bitrate setting) are valid according to the FFmpeg syntax described.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output passes all evaluation criteria. It contains a correct and functional FFmpeg command that addresses the user's transformation request without errors or unsupported options. Therefore, it successfully meets the requirements set forth by the user."
