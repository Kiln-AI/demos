  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect on a video using ffmpeg, you can chain multiple video filters using the -vf option with filtergraph syntax. The filters are separated by commas, and the order matters: usually you want to add text after the blur so the text remains sharp, or vice versa depending on your desired effect.\n\n- For overlaying text, use the drawtext filter. You can customize position, font size, color, etc.\n- For blurring, use the gblur or boxblur filter. gblur provides a customizable Gaussian-like blur.\n- When chaining filters, you often want to keep the output pipe from one filter as the input to the next filter (implicity by chaining).\n  \nExample assumes:\n- Input video is input.mp4.\n- Text you want is \"Sample Text\" at position x=10, y=50, font size 24, color white.\n- Blur radius of 10x10 for a noticeable softness.\n- Output is output.mp4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"gblur=sigmaX=10:sigmaY=10,drawtext=text='Sample Text':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=50\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to blur first then overlay sharp text on top, switch filter order:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='Sample Text':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=50,gblur=sigmaX=10:sigmaY=10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The filtergraph is a Python-style chain, each filter separated by a comma: \"filter1,filter2\".\n- drawtext is configured with fontcolor, fontsize, and position.\n- For audio, -c:a copy copies audio without re-encoding.\n- You can adjust sigmaX and sigmaY values in gblur for strength.\n\nThis technique efficiently chains multiple video filters.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's analyze the model's output based on the evaluation criteria provided:\n\n1. **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The issue described is that the model sometimes generates commands that do not work correctly or do not match the user's requirements. In this case, the model's output does generate a valid `ffmpeg` command that chains multiple video filters correctly, using `gblur` and `drawtext`. No syntax errors or misuse of parameters are noted. Therefore, the output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2. **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   The failing output example provided shows an invalid command using a preset that does not exist. The model's output command is well-structured and does not break any parameter requirements as it uses valid filter options (`gblur` and `drawtext`). Thus, it is not similar to the example of a failing output.\n\n3. **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command generated by the model adheres to the syntax and requirements specified in the `ffmpeg` man page. The filters are chained together correctly with the `-vf` option, the input and output files are specified correctly, and the audio stream is copied without re-encoding. Therefore, no requirements from the man page are broken in the command provided.\n\n4. **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Since the output does not contain any errors, follows the necessary syntax, and successfully meets the user's request for filtering, the answer is that it does **not** contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass the evaluation.\n\nFinal evaluation: **Pass**. The model successfully generated a valid `ffmpeg` command without any issues."
