  "input": "I want to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of my input file multi_track.mp4 into a single output file",
  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the appropriate video and audio streams from the multi-track input file, which aligns with the user's request to merge stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio). \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. Instead of attempting to use an invalid option or incorrectly executed parameters, the output generates a command that is syntactically correct and logically coherent based on the requirements of the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It uses the basic structure for mapping streams and making a copy of the specified video and audio streams without any re-encoding, which is permissible. The command adheres to the guidelines outlined in the man page regarding stream selection and output specifications.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a valid command that properly meets the user requirements and adheres to the expected syntax and functionality of the `ffmpeg` command line tool. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
