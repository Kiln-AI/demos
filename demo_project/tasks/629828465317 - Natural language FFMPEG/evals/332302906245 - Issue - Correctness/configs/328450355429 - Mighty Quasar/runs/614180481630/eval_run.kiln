  "output": "To convert the video.webm file to an MP4 file using the H.264 codec with the \"veryfast\" preset (closest to \"lightning\"), map the existing audio streams without re-encoding, and copy all available metadata, use the following command:\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 encoder.\n- `-preset veryfast` sets the encoding speed vs quality tradeoff. Since \"lightning\" isn't a standard preset, I've selected \"veryfast\" for a similar effect (fast encoding speed, slightly lower compression efficiency). Standard presets in ascending order of speed/quality tradeoff are: `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, `faster`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, `veryslow`. Use one of these values depending on your needs.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio streams without re-encoding, assuming the input audio codec is compatible with the output container.\n- `-map_metadata 0` copies metadata from the input file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -c:a copy -map_metadata 0 output.mp4\n```\nNote: I assumed the input file has a compatible audio codec for MP4 and sufficient metadata worth preserving. Adjust the command if your requirements differ (e.g., specifying a different audio codec or ignoring metadata).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated is valid and all options used are compatible with ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The preset \"veryfast\" is a valid option, whereas \"extra_fast\" was not valid in the failure example.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All the options used are appropriate and conform to the syntax and structure outlined.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus it should pass. The command is correct and meets the user's requirements."
