  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "Here's the command:\n```\n`ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -vf select='nottagName=[\"main\",tract\"]' -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:v 500k -b:a 128k -ar 48k -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 output.mp4`\n```\nExplanation:\n- `select='nottagName=[\"main\",tract\"]'` selects only the streams that are not named \"main\" or \"tract\", as the selection default is to select streams with names matching. Here, we want to select only the 4th and 9th video and audio streams, respectively.\n\nAssumptions:\n- There are 5 video streams and 10 audio streams in the input file.\n- The names of the streams are not \"main\" or \"tract\", which are common default stream names in video files.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command provided does not correctly select the specified video stream (0:4) and audio stream (0:9) from the input file. The parameter `select='nottagName=[\"main\",tract\"]'` does not fulfill the user's request. Instead, the user has asked to map specific streams using the `-map` option, which is correctly placed in the command but the other parts are incorrectly specified.\n\n2) The output resembles the failure example in that it writes an incorrect command. The output would likely not execute correctly since the `select` filter used here does not correspond to the requirements specified in the user message. Additionally, there is a syntax error in the `select` filter (it incorrectly specifies a `tagName` which is irrelevant for stream selection).\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page directly regarding command syntax or order. However, it does fail because it incorrectly attempts to select streams based on invalid criteria instead of using the explicit mapping requested by the user.\n\n4) The command should fail based on the user's requirements since the video mapping and audio mapping are not being executed correctly. Therefore, it **contains the issue** and **fails**."
