  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To meet your requirement of encoding a video at **8000k bitrate (8 Mbps)** for high-quality definition and **studio-grade audio at 2048k (2 Mbps)**, the following approach is taken:\n\n- **Video Bitrate (`-b:v 8000k`)**: Sets a target video bitrate of 8 Mbps for high-resolution, lossy compression (e.g., 4K or optimized 1080p). This is ideal for streaming or preserving high detail.\n- **Audio Bitrate (`-b:a 2048k`)**: Encodes audio at 2 Mbps using the AAC codec (`-c:a aac`), which is suitable for professional audio quality (e.g., 5.1 channel surround or high-fidelity stereo).\n- **Video Codec (`-c:v libx264`)**: Uses H.264 for efficient compression while maintaining compatibility with most playback environments. A `-preset slow` is chosen for better compression efficiency (slower encoding, higher quality for the specified bitrate).\n- **Pixel Format (`-pix_fmt yuv420p`)**: Ensures broad device and browser compatibility.\n- **Streaming Optimization (`-movflags +faststart`)**: Makes the MP4 file playable immediately in a browser, even when downloading.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is in a standard format (e.g., MP4, AVI, MOV) containing audio and video.\n- `libx264` and `aac` are the desired codecs (no codec is explicitly requested in the query).\n- Presets aren't specified, so `slow` (a balance between speed and quality) is selected to better handle the high-bitrate target.\n- Resolution remains unchanged (you didn't request resizing).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 2048k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step according to the criteria you've provided:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The output correctly addresses the user's request for specific audio and video bitrates and generates an appropriate `ffmpeg` command. There are no apparent issues in terms of syntax or logic within the command itself. Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The model's output includes a valid command and parameters, therefore it is not similar to the failure example provided (the failing example shows a non-existent preset \"extra_fast\"). The command generated by the model uses valid codecs, presets, and options. Thus, it is not a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the syntax rules laid out in the man page. It appropriately specifies input and output files, along with the options for video and audio encoding. There are no violations of the rules around command structure or option usage.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Since the command is correctly formatted and respects the requirements, then it does not contain the issue described. The output should pass.\n\nOverall, the model's output is accurate and meets the user's request effectively. Thus, the evaluation concludes that the output is a success."
