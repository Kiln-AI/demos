  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To ensure maximum compatibility across all devices and browsers, we'll use H.264 for video encoding and AAC for audio within an MP4 container. These codecs are widely supported on both desktop and mobile platforms.\n\nKey settings:\n- Use H.264 (`libx264`) for video encoding.\n- Use AAC (`aac`) for audio encoding.\n- Specify a compatible pixel format (`yuv420p`) to ensure playback on older devices and software.\n- Set `-movflags +faststart` for better streaming and browser compatibility, especially for progressive playback from URLs.\n- Enable key quality and compatibility parameters like `-crf` (Constant Rate Factor), `-preset`, and audio bitrate to maintain a good quality-to-size ratio without compromising compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your source is a video file, likely with a modern codec that needs remuxing or re-encoding.\n- We'll maintain the original resolution and frame rate unless otherwise specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output provided by the model does not appear to contain any issues. The ffmpeg command seems appropriate for the task of converting a video file for maximum compatibility across devices. It uses widely accepted codecs (H.264 for video and AAC for audio), and includes key parameters to ensure compatibility (like pixel format and faststart). Therefore, this output does not demonstrate an issue as described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example where an incorrect preset was mentioned (`extra_fast`). The command generated by the model uses valid options and parameters that conform to ffmpeg requirements, such as valid codecs, pixel formats, and valid command format. Therefore, this output does not exhibit characteristics of a failing output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - No, the command generated by the model respects the requirements laid out in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options and input/output specification adheres to the general rules of ffmpeg use. All parameters used are valid according to the documentation, and the provided command format follows the expected syntax for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does not contain the issue described. The model produced a valid and functioning ffmpeg command that is appropriate for the task. Therefore, the final answer is that the output passes the evaluation."
