  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To explicitly select and combine specific streams from a source file, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg. Here, you want to take the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of source.mkv, and save the result as edited.mp4.\n\nBy default, ffmpeg will re-encode if necessary. Unless you specify codecs, ffmpeg will choose defaults based on the output container. For best compatibility with MP4, use H.264 for video and AAC for audio. If the source streams are already compatible and you want to copy them without re-encoding, use -c copy, but for maximum compatibility, I'll assume you want to encode.\n\nHere’s how you use -map to choose your streams, and -c:v and -c:a to set codecs for MP4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```\n\n- -map 0:3 and -map 0:5 selects the video and audio streams respectively.\n- -c:v libx264 encodes video as H.264 (compatible with MP4).\n- -c:a aac encodes audio as AAC (compatible with MP4).\n- -crf 23 offers a good quality/size tradeoff for H.264.\n- -movflags +faststart allows for fast web streaming.\n\nIf you know the streams are already in compatible formats and want to avoid re-encoding (for speed and no quality loss), use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\n—but keep in mind: both streams must be compatible with the MP4 container for -c copy to work.\n\nAssumption: You want browser-friendly MP4, so I recommend encoding as shown in the first command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated correctly addresses the user's request to map the specified video and audio streams from the input file to an output file, `edited.mp4`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command generated by the model does not contain any mistakes that would cause it to fail. It uses valid options and arguments according to the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the proper syntax and uses valid options such as `-map` to select specific streams, along with codec options that are suitable for the MP4 container (`-c:v libx264` for video and `-c:a aac` for audio). \n\n4) Based on evaluations 1-3, the model's output should be considered a pass because it accurately fulfills the user's request without introducing any issues or errors in the command."
