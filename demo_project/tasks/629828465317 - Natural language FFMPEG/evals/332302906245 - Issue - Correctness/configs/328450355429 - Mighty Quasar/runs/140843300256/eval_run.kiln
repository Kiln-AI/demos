  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To apply a semi-transparent watermark at the bottom left corner of the video, use the *vf overlay* filter to combine the video with the watermark image. First, enable semi-transparency by using the *png* filter to parse the image. Then, use the *overlay* filter to place the overlayed image in the bottom-left corner relative to the *video filterframe*.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \\\n    overlay=0:0:1:x=(w-tw)/2, \\\n    png:logo.png \\\n    output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n\n*   `overlay=0:0:1:x=(w-tw)/2` tells ffmpeg to display the overlayed image from left 0, top 0, width 1, and x position is set at half of the width of the output frame minus the width of the image (`(w-tw)/2`).\n*   `png:logo.png` tells ffmpeg to read the semi transparent image with PNG as the filter format.\n\n`Assumption: The size (width, height, aspect ratio) and type of the water image logo.png (`png` is for parsing PNG image file, and ffmpeg works with image size in terms of pixels, specified in width:height, and all cases are treated as a specific square width to some degree; and `2:1` is a typical `aspect ratio` for most images.)`",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command generated is incorrect both in terms of syntax and parameters. The use of `overlay=0:0:1:x=(w-tw)/2` incorrectly specifies the placement of the watermark, and the filtering with `png:logo.png` is not a valid method to specify the input image for transparency. The correct way should specify transparency and place the watermark in the bottom-left corner without those errors.\n\n2) Yes, the output is similar to the example of a failing output. It contains invalid options like `png:logo.png`, which does not apply here as it does not follow the desired command structure. Thereâ€™s also a misunderstanding in the overlay function usage.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks some requirements dictated in the man page. Specifically, the way the `overlay` filter is composed is incorrect. The proper usage to add a watermark would be `overlay=x:y`, where `x` and `y` specify the position of the watermark. The `png:` prefix is not appropriate. The command fails to correctly apply the filter syntax, violating the expected command structure.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output indeed contains the issues described, and thus it should fail based on the evaluation criteria provided."
