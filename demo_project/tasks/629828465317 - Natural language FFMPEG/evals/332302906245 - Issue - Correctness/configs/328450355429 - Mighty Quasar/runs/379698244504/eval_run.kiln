  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with noise reduction, I'll use the experimental FLAC encoder and apply audio filtering for noise reduction.\n\n- `-vn` disables video stream (audio only extraction)\n- `-c:a flac` uses the FLAC audio codec\n- `-strict experimental` enables the experimental FLAC encoder (though modern FFmpeg versions have stable FLAC support)\n- `-af \"afftdn=nf=-25\"` applies adaptive FFT denoiser for noise reduction. The `nf=-25` parameter sets the noise floor in dB (adjust between -80 to -20 as needed; lower values = more aggressive noise reduction)\n- `-compression_level 12` sets maximum FLAC compression for smaller file size\n\nI'm assuming you want moderate noise reduction. If the audio is very noisy, you might want to lower the `nf` value to -40 or -50. If you want minimal processing, you can increase it to -15 or -10.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af \"afftdn=nf=-25\" -c:a flac -strict experimental -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nFor heavier noise reduction, you could also chain multiple filters:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af \"afftdn=nf=-40,highpass=f=80,lowpass=f=8000\" -c:a flac -strict experimental -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated correctly extracts audio from the specified video file, applies noise reduction, and encodes the result in FLAC format with the appropriate codec settings. The command appears to work correctly and matches the user's request for the specified transformations.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The generated command is valid and uses existing FFmpeg options and flags appropriately. It does not use any options that are known to be incorrect or non-existent, which would typically characterize a failure output.\n\n3) After reviewing the FFmpeg man page, the command generated by the model adheres to the syntax and behavior outlined in the documentation. The commands (`-vn`, `-c:a flac`, `-strict experimental`, `-af \"afftdn=nf=-25\"`, and `-compression_level 12`) are supported and correctly applied. The assumptions made about noise reduction settings and the limits of input/output streams align well with the guidelines.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described and is technically sound according to the FFmpeg documentation. Therefore, the output should be considered correct."
