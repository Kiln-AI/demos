  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically (one on top of the other), use the `xstack` filter with `inputs=2` and `vk` (vertical stack) layout. This requires both videos to have the same width and pixel format for proper alignment. If their dimensions or formats differ, scaling and pixel format conversion may be necessary.\n\nAssuming the input videos are already compatible or you want to scale them to the same width (for example, to the width of `top_video.mp4`) and keep their original height ratios, the following command:\n\n- Uses `-filter_complex` with `xstack=inputs=2:layout=0_0|0_h` which stacks input0 (top_video.mp4) at (0,0) and input1 (bottom_video.mp4) directly below it.\n- `-map \"[v]\"` selects the output video stream after the filter.\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium` for good quality encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` to encode audio in AAC at 128 kbps.\n- `-y` to overwrite output if it exists without prompt.\n\nIf you want more control—such as scaling inputs yourselves—you can add scaling filters accordingly.\n\nHere is the command for direct stacking with assumed compatible inputs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v:0][1:v:0]xstack=inputs=2:layout=0_0|0_h[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -y stacked.mp4\n```\n\nIf the videos are not aligned in width, consider adding scale filters, e.g.:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v:0]scale=iw:ih[v0];[1:v:0]scale=iw:ih[v1];[v0][v1]xstack=inputs=2:layout=0_0|0_h[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -y stacked.mp4\n```\n\nwhich scales both to the width and height of `top_video.mp4`. Adjust as needed based on input compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The provided `ffmpeg` command correctly uses the `xstack` filter to stack two videos vertically. It also includes appropriate encoding options, which are not missing or incorrect. The assumptions made about the videos' compatibility were communicated clearly, and necessary command syntax was properly followed to ensure functionality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain invalid options or incorrect syntax. All options used in the command properly adhere to known `ffmpeg` commands, and they are relevant to the operation of stacking videos.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The syntax used is correct, with options structuring that is compliant with the expected format: specifying input files, utilizing `-filter_complex` for advanced filters, and establishing output file formats and encoding settings accordingly.\n\n4) Since the command is syntactically correct, follows the `ffmpeg` guidelines, and successfully addresses the user's request without errors, it should pass the evaluation. The model has successfully generated an executable command for the task provided."
