  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract audio stream 5 (assuming the streams are numbered starting from 0) from input.mov and combine it with the video, you need to:\n\n- Copy the video stream directly without re-encoding (if the audio extraction affects the metadata you can choose to re-encode).\n- Map the audio stream explicitly (stream #5, stream selection depends on the container).\n- Use `-map` options to include only video from the original input and audio from stream 5.\n- Use `-c:v copy -c:a copy` to preserve original quality and avoid unnecessary encoding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- There is only one video stream in the input and you want to keep that video stream.\n- Stream index 5 is in fact the audio stream you need.\n- You want to avoid re-encoding and preserve streams as is.\n- The output format or container matches the codecs found in the input.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v -map 0:a:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v`: Include all video streams from input #0 (input.mov).\n- `-map 0:a:5`: Include audio stream 5 from input #0.\n- `-c:v copy`: Copy the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copy the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `output.mkv`: Output file in MKV container, which supports various codec types. If differing codecs need encoding, adjust the codecs accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly maps the required video and audio streams and uses the appropriate parameters to execute the transformation requested in the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and does not contain any illegal options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct structure for specifying input and output streams, correctly uses the `-map` options to select the specific video and audio tracks, and applies the `-c:v copy -c:a copy` options for stream copying.\n\n4) Given these evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and passes the criteria specified."
