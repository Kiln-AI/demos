  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize your shaky video using the `deshake` filter in ffmpeg, you can apply the filter directly to the input video. The `deshake` filter attempts to reduce the shakiness by detecting and compensating for camera motion.\n\nHereâ€™s a command that takes `bumpy_ride.mp4` as input, applies the `deshake` filter, and outputs a stabilized version called `bumpy_ride_stabilized.mp4`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy bumpy_ride_stabilized.mp4\n```\n\n- `-vf deshake` applies the stabilization filter.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding, preserving audio quality.\n- Output is saved as a new file, so the original remains untouched.\n\nIf you want more control over the `deshake` filter parameters (like `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `rx`, `ry`), let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command generated is valid and meets the user's request to stabilize a shaky video using the `deshake` filter.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is correct and uses valid options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options are correctly used and follow the required syntax.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output successfully accomplishes the task without any issues. It correctly applies the `deshake` filter while preserving the audio in the original format, and outputs the stabilized video as requested. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
