    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command accurately reflects the user's requests for selecting specific audio and video streams from the input file without errors or incorrect parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is valid and uses correct syntax for selecting the specified streams, while the failure example contains an invalid preset option that does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The syntax used for mapping the input streams is correct, and the parameters used comply with the expected command structure outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command functions correctly according to the specifics of `ffmpeg` and matches the userâ€™s request accurately, it passes the evaluation criteria and does not contain the described issue."
