  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To encode your video at a constant video bitrate of 8000 kbps and set the audio bitrate to 2048 kbps (2 Mbps, which is higher than typical and offers very high audio quality), use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options. For studio quality audio, I'll assume your input is already high quality and you want to use AAC at 2048k.\n\n**Note:** Not all players or formats support AAC at such a high bitrate. `-b:a 2048k` will generally work with `mp4`.\n\n**Example for `input.mp4` to `output.mp4`:**\n\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets the video bitrate.\n- `-b:a 2048k` sets the audio bitrate.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` use standard codecs.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional but recommended for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -c:a aac -b:a 2048k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with your filenames. If your audio source is very high quality (like WAV), you may wish to consider using lossless codecs; otherwise, AAC at 2048k should be more than sufficient for most purposes.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly reflects the user's request to set the video bitrate to 8000 kbps and the audio bitrate to 2048 kbps, while also using appropriate codec settings. It adheres to the requirements without any syntax errors.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command constructed by the model uses valid options and parameters, unlike the example which contained a broken command with an invalid preset.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg: Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe generated command adheres to the ffmpeg man page requirements. The options used (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-c:a`, and `-b:a`) are correctly applied, and the output file is specified at the end of the command line, in compliance with the syntax described in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described and passes under the given evaluation criteria. It generates a correct ffmpeg command that meets the user's request without breaking any requirements dictated by the man page."
