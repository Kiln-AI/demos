  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "**Explanation:** For maximum storage space compression, you want to use the `max` preset (available since `ffmpeg 4.2`) or the `libx264-vp9` encoder in `ffmpeg version 4.1 and later`, both resulting in an intermediate decoding-quality encoding, i.e., fast decoding and quick encoding. However, `max` is the one recommended by FFmpeg for upscaling, as explained below.\n\n- **-movflags +faststart**: This sets metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n\n\n`**ffmpeg**```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n`Assumptions`: Output path is already provided.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. Although it mentions the `max` preset, it fails to include it in the actual `ffmpeg` command. As a result, the command does not appropriately address the user's request to compress the video using the \"maximum_efficiency\" preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. While it does not execute the intended compression command due to the absence of the preset, it does not generate a command syntax error like using a nonexistent preset (such as `extra_fast`).\n\n3) The output command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page, as it only includes the `-movflags +faststart` flag, which is valid. However, it is also incomplete in fulfilling the user's request for compressing the video.\n\n4) Given the evaluation, the model's output contains an issue. It fails to properly generate an `ffmpeg` command that includes the required preset for maximum efficiency compression, thus it does not fulfill the user's request adequately. Therefore, the evaluation concludes that the model's performance on this task fails."
