  "output": "To select specific audio and video streams from a MKV file, you can use the `-map` option in FFmpeg. This option tells FFmpeg which streams to include in the output file.\n\n- `map`: Specifies the input streams to be included in the output. The format is `[input_file] -map [stream_index]`.\n- `[input_file]`: The name of your input file (source.mkv).\n- `[stream_index]`: The index of the stream you want to select (15 for video, 22 for audio).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct regarding the use of stream selection with the `-map` option. It correctly specifies the input file and maps the desired video and audio streams, following the user's request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is syntactically correct and does not utilize any parameters that are invalid or non-existent.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses `-map` to specify video and audio streams from the input file. The order of options is also correct, with the `-i` option preceding the map options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass as it does not contain the issue described. The command is appropriately structured and fulfills the user's request without errors or invalid syntax."
