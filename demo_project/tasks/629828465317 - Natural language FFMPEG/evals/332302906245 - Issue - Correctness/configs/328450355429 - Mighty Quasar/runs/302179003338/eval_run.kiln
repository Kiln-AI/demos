  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as a high-quality MP3, use the LAME codec, which is a popular choice for encoding audio into MP3 format.\n\n- `ffmpeg -i video.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-vn` tells `ffmpeg` not to process any video (skip video) since we're only interested in extracting the audio.\n- `-ar 44.1k` sets the sampling rate to 44.1 kHz, which is the standard for CDs (you can adjust this value if desired).\n- `-ac 2` specifies the number of audio channels: in this case, 2 for stereo (you can adjust this value if desired).\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` uses the LAME MP3 encoder.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the bitrate to 320 kbps, which is considered high-quality for MP3.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -ar 44.1k -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```\n\nNote that some systems might not support libmp3lame out of the box. Be prepared to install libmp3lame separately, e.g., with `sudo apt-get install libmp3lame-dev`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated accurately reflects the user's request for extracting audio from `video.mkv` and saving it as a high-quality MP3 file with a maximum bitrate of 320 kbps. The parameters used are generally appropriate for achieving this task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command constructed is valid and functions as intended: it uses existing options and codecs that are correctly set for the task at hand (e.g., `libmp3lame` and a bitrate of `320k`), and thus it should execute without error.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All provided options (e.g., `-vn`, `-ar`, `-ac`, `-c:a`, and `-b:a`) adhere to the expected syntax and functionality as described in the ffmpeg documentation. Each option is being applied correctly with its intended purpose recognized.\n\nOverall, the model's output passes all of these evaluation steps as it meets the user's requirements with a valid and appropriate ffmpeg command."
