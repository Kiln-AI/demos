  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To selectively extract video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from aMatroska file (`broadcast.mkv`) and save them as `trimmed.mp4`, you can use stream specifiers to cherry-pick the desired video and audio streams. FFmpeg supports stream selection using `-map`.\n\nKey points:\n- `-map 0:4` extracts the 5th (index 4) video stream from the input.\n- `-map 0:9` extracts the 10th (index 9) audio stream from the input.\n- Output container format MP4 requires H.264 video codec; so, use `-c:v libx264` to encode video.\n- For MP4, AAC audio codec is compatible, so use `-c:a aac`.\n- To include only the selected streams, no need for keyframe insertion (`-movflags +faststart`), but adding it ensures the mp4 file is compatible with web playback.\n\nAssumption: You have at least two video streams and eighteen audio streams in the input (0:0, 0:1, 0:2, 0:3 | 0:4, 0:5...), and you simply want those two streams in the output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nIf instead you want only the selected streams and strip all others:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nNote: Make sure the stream indices are correct based on your input file. You can verify stream indices by running `ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. The command `ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4` incorrectly uses both `-map 0:v:0` and `-map 0:a:0`, which are unnecessary since the user specifically requested to extract `0:4` and `0:9`. The additional mappings add complexity and are not aligned with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example contained an invalid preset option, whereas here the command generally uses valid options. However, it does have unnecessary mappings that could generate issues.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The `-map` options are correctly constructed and use valid mappings. All options follow the syntax rules stipulated.\n\n4) Given the unnecessary complications introduced by the extra `-map` options in the output command, it can be determined that the output does reflect the issue described. The command does not correctly match the user's simple request and is thus flawed. Therefore, it fails this evaluation."
