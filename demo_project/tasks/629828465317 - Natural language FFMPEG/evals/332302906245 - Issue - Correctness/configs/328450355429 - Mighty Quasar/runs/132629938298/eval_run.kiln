    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated ffmpeg command correctly sets the video and audio bitrates as requested by the user, matches the requirements, and adheres to the proper syntax of the ffmpeg command.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided in the <failure_example>. The output command generated correctly uses valid options without introducing an invalid preset or other incorrect specifications.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used in the command, such as `-c:v libx264` for video encoding and `-c:a aac` for audio encoding, are valid and appropriate for the task of setting bitrates, and they follow the order and syntax rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and thus should pass the evaluation."
