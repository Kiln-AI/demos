  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To transform the MKV file to MP4 using the VP9 codec with support for WebM streaming, we will change the container and container video codec to output MP4 while also removing the MKV's subtitle support and compressing audio to AAC using a small bitrate. This can be achieved with the following modifications:\n\n* Replace the container with mp4.\n* Disable MP3 with -vo null to limit what the library outputs. Then ensure the output MP4 will be supported by modern browsers by forcing a limited color space (using 4:2:0).\n* Use libvpx to enable VP9 rendering in MP4.\n* Optimize for low latency due to streaming by disabling 'copy' and the 'pre'' metadata, as these may slow down the loading, as well as setting required encoding details with -x and -use_explicit_name flags.\n* Discard aac, because we only want to use a unique file name. Also, remove the stream number to make sure all audio is always taken from the corresponding audio of the MP4 file.\n* Keep any other parameters like -crf for quality, if it is better than 31 for better low latency.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx libvpx -crf 31 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -s 1920x1080 -movflags +faststart -use_explicit_name -x 1 -map_metadata 1 -y output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions made:\nThat the user wants the original MP4 quality close to original while dealing with the streaming requirements.\nThat 1920x1080 resolution allows for maximum resolution and better support from players.\nThat 49dB quality is set in crf, providing acceptable quality (assumed to be good quality).\n\nThe -use_explicit_name provides useful diagnostics in case of a streaming breakdown or MP4 metadata problems enabling the necessary output.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here? \nYes, the model's output contains multiple issues. The command generated has incorrect or non-standard parameters that could potentially lead to its failure. For instance, the use of `-vo null`, which is not a valid FFmpeg option, and other incorrect flags like `-x` and `-use_explicit_name` which do not exist. Additionally, the mention of removing AAC encoding is contradictory since AAC is intended for the audio stream, which should be retained.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?\nYes, the output is similar because it includes parameters that are not standard or incorrect, leading to a command that would likely fail. For instance, options like `-x` and `-use_explicit_name` are not supported in FFmpeg.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nYes, the command does break the requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters and options used, such as `-vo null`, `-use_explicit_name`, and `-x`, are not recognized in FFmpeg, which would lead to an error when executing the command.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? \nFail. The command contains multiple errors and issues that do not match the user requirements or valid FFmpeg syntax, making it unlikely to work correctly."
