  "output": "To convert movie.mkv into an MP4 file quickly using the ultrafast preset for encoding, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs (widely supported in browsers and devices), and map the existing audio streams.\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding.\n- preset ultrafast focuses on encoding speed over compression efficiency. This preset is fast but may produce larger files due to slightly lower compression efficiency.\n- map_metadata sets the output metadata to the input metadata. -map_metadata 0:s:v:0/metadata:s:0/m sets metadata on the first output stream 's' (video) from the first metadata stream '0' in the first input file 'movie.mkv'. 0 is the whole file.\n- movflags +faststart places metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n- c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes you want to keep the original resolution, aspect ratio, and the audio stream from the original movie.mkv.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description> provided. The command it generated appears correctly formatted and fits the user's requirement for converting a video file to MP4 format with a specified preset for quick encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The output uses the valid preset \"ultrafast\", while the failure example contains a non-existent preset \"extra_fast\". Therefore, the command produced by the model is valid.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the generated command does not break any requirements. The options used are in accordance with the expected input and output parameters for ffmpeg, and the order of the options matches the expected format based on the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Given this analysis, the model's output does not contain an issue as described, and thus it passes the evaluation."
