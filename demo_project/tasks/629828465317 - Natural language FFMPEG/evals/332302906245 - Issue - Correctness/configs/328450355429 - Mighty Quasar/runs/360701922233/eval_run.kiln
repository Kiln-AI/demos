  "input": "I have a file `input.mov` and I want to convert it to MP4. Please use the `extra_fast` preset because speed is very important.",
  "output": "To convert your `input.mov` to MP4 quickly, we'll use the libx264 codec with the `ultrafast` preset (FFmpeg doesn't have an `extra_fast` preset, but `ultrafast` is the fastest preset available). This ensures the conversion prioritizes speed over compression efficiency. The command will copy the audio stream as-is to save time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command uses:\n- `-c:v libx264` to encode video with H.264 codec.\n- `-preset ultrafast` for fastest encoding speed.\n- `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding audio, speeding up the process.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it generated a valid FFmpeg command. The command it provided uses the `ultrafast` preset correctly, which is the closest to `extra_fast`, and other parameters are aligned with the user's request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated by the model does not specify an invalid preset (it correctly uses `ultrafast`) and thus would not fail for this reason.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements in the man page. The generated command structure follows the required order, and all options used are valid parameters for FFmpeg, including specifying codecs and using proper input/output file names.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
