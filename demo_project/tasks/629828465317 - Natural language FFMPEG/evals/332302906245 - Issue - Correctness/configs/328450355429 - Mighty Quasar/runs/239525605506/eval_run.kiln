  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds, you can use the `-vf fps=1/2` filter, which picks one frame every 2 seconds. For ultra high resolution, we assume the video is already high-res, so the images will be saved at the source resolution. To save as PNG images, specify the output name with a `%04d.png` pattern.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command `ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png` correctly extracts frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and saves them as PNG images. The parameters used are valid and align with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any invalid options or parameters; therefore, it does not exhibit similar errors to the provided failure example.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The use of the `-vf fps=1/2` filter and output naming with `frame_%04d.png` are both valid according to the options available in the FFmpeg documentation. Furthermore, the output specification as PNG format is supported.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issues described; it correctly generates a valid FFmpeg command that matches the user's requirements. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
