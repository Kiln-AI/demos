  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "To merge multiple audio tracks into a single high-quality FLAC file, I'll use FFmpeg's concat filter to combine the audio streams and apply the studio_master preset for maximum quality preservation.\n\nThe studio_master preset typically implies:\n- Lossless compression (FLAC is perfect for this)\n- High bit depth and sample rate preservation\n- No quality degradation during processing\n\nAssuming you have multiple audio files (audio1.wav, audio2.wav, etc.) that you want to concatenate:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio1.wav -i audio2.wav -i audio3.wav -filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a][2:a]concat=n=3:v=0:a=1[out]\" -map \"[out]\" -c:a flac -compression_level 12 -sample_fmt s32 output.flac\n```\n\n**Parameters explained:**\n- `filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a][2:a]concat=n=3:v=0:a=1[out]\"` concatenates 3 audio streams (adjust `n=3` to match your number of files)\n- `n=3` specifies number of input segments\n- `v=0:a=1` means 0 video streams, 1 audio stream output\n- `-c:a flac` uses FLAC lossless codec\n- `-compression_level 12` maximum FLAC compression (slowest but smallest file)\n- `-sample_fmt s32` uses 32-bit samples for studio master quality\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- You want to concatenate files sequentially (not mix them simultaneously)\n- All input files have compatible sample rates and channel configurations\n- You have 3 input files (adjust the command for your actual number of files)\n\nIf you want to **mix** the tracks simultaneously instead of concatenating them, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio1.wav -i audio2.wav -i audio3.wav -filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a][2:a]amix=inputs=3:duration=longest[out]\" -map \"[out]\" -c:a flac -compression_level 12 -sample_fmt s32 output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The command generated by the model does not contain any obvious errors or issues that would prevent it from functioning as intended, given the user's requirements of merging multiple audio tracks into one FLAC file using the studio_master preset. The command is structured correctly and follows the logic required to concatenate audio files. There are no blatantly incorrect options or parameters that would cause the command to fail outright based on the user's specification.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command is valid and uses appropriate options and values according to the expected functionality of FFmpeg. The model did not invoke any nonexistent preset or incorrect parameter, hence it passes this evaluation point.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the output against the FFmpeg man page, no requirements are broken. The command adheres to the correct usage format for merging audio files and applying the required codec and parameters. The options, such as `-filter_complex` for concatenation and `-c:a flac` for codec specification, are correctly utilized, and the parameters align with available options in the FFmpeg documentation. \n\n4) Overall, the command provided by the model does not exhibit issues as described, utilizes a valid format, parameters, and follows best practices as outlined in the FFmpeg documentation. Therefore, it passes evaluation without containing errors or problems in its output."
