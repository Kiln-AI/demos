  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To quickly compress movie.mkv while maintaining reasonable quality, we'll use H.264 with the \"ultrafast\" preset for maximum encoding speed. This will significantly reduce file size faster than other presets, though at the cost of compression efficiency (larger file than slower presets would produce).\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding\n- preset ultrafast enables the fastest encoding preset in x264\n- crf 23 sets a default quality level (duplicate streams will be skipped)\n- c:a copy preserves original audio without re-encoding to save time and avoid quality loss\n- Assuming the original audio is already compressed (like AAC or AC-3), there's no need to re-encode\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated is valid and should execute properly. The command's parameters match the user's request to compress the file using the turbo preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The preset \"ultrafast\" exists in FFmpeg, and the generated command uses it correctly without any erroneous options like \"extra_fast\".\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The specified options and parameter ordering are appropriate, and all options used are valid for FFmpeg.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. Overall, the generated command is correct for the task given and meets the user's requirements. Therefore, the evaluation passes."
