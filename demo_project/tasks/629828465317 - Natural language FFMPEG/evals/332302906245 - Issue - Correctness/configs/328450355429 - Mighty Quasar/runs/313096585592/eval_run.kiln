  "input": "I need to crop my video to 16:9 aspect ratio and encode with libx265 using the placebo_plus preset",
  "output": "To crop your video to a 16:9 aspect ratio, first calculate the target width and height based on the original resolution or specify a scale and then crop accordingly using the crop filter. Assuming you want to center-crop the video to the largest possible 16:9 area (keeping the original video centered and height or width adjusted so the aspect ratio is 16:9), you can use FFmpeg's `crop` filter with expressions. \n\nUsing libx265 (HEVC) with the placebo_plus preset maximizes compression efficiency and quality. This preset is the highest quality/largest size setting for encoding speed, suitable for high-quality outputs where encoding time is less critical.\n\nHere's a common approach:\n\n1. Compute the cropping dimensions: For example, if the video is wider than 16:9, crop the width; if it's taller than 16:9, crop the height.\n2. Use the `-vf \"crop=...\"` filter with the appropriate expressions.\n3. Encode with libx265, preset placebo_plus, and CRF for quality control.\n\nKey parameters in the command:\n\n- `-preset placebo_plus`: maximum quality with slow encoding.\n- `-crf 28`: a clear quality setting for HEVC; adjust as needed.\n- `-c:a copy`: copies audio as-is (or re-encode if desired).\n\nAssuming the input is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"crop='min(iw/1.7777777777778,ih)':'min(iw/1.7777777777778,ih)':'(iw-(min(iw/1.7777777777778,ih)*1.7777777777778))/2':(ih-(min(iw/1.7777777777778,ih)))/2\" -c:v libx265 -preset placebo_plus -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `iw` and `ih` are input width and height.\n- `iw/1.7777777777778` computes the width if height was set to match a 16:9 ratio (since 16:9 = 1.777...).\n- We use `min()` to select the smaller of the current width and the calculated 16:9 width to determine crop width.\n- The same kind of calculation is used for height.\n- Then centered cropping is done by calculating offsets: `((iw - crop_width)/2)` etc.\n- `-vf` applies video filter for cropping.\n\nIf you just want to keep the original height and crop width accordingly:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"crop=iw*9/16:ih:(iw-(iw*9/16))/2:0\" -c:v libx265 -preset placebo_plus -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nOr if you want to keep the original width and crop height accordingly:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"crop=iw:ih*16/9:(iw - iw): (ih - ih*16/9) /2\" -c:v libx265 -preset placebo_plus -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nChoose one depending on your cropping priorities.\n\nLet me know your input resolution if you want a more tailored crop command!",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues related to generating an ffmpeg command that works correctly. The command generated is detailed and follows the user's request effectively, providing a proper crop and codec settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command includes valid options and parameters, does not reference any nonexistent presets or improperly ordered options, and accurately addresses the user's needs.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct order for options and outputs, uses valid codec (libx265) and preset (placebo_plus), and applies the video filter for cropping correctly.\n\n4) Thus, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, and it should pass the evaluation."
