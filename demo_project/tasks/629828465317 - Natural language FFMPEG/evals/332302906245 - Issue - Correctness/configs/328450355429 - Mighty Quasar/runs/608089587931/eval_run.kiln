  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file, use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vn -ab 320k -ar 44.1k -ac 2 -f mp3 output.mp3 -vn -ar 44.1k -ac 2 -f wav output.wav\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input video file is named `input.avi`.\n* You want to extract stereo audio (2 channels) with a sample rate of 44.1 kHz.\n* You want to save the MP3 file with a bitrate of 320 kbps.\n* You want to save the WAV file with the same sample rate and channel configuration as the MP3 file.\n\nThe `-vn` option tells `ffmpeg` not to write any video output, only audio. The `-ab 320k` option sets the bitrate for the MP3 audio to 320 kbps. The `-f mp3` and `-f wav` options specify the output formats as MP3 and WAV, respectively.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The `ffmpeg` command generated by the model will not work correctly because the `-vn` option is included multiple times for the same input. The correct approach should be to specify the audio extraction options for each output stream separately without repeating the `-vn` flag and to specify the output files after the `-i` input. The overall structure of the command should differentiate the parameters for each output instead of treating them as separate instances, which leads to faulty command formation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example, as it does not use an invalid or non-existent option. However, the command is incorrectly constructed, which causes it to fail in extracting the audio as desired.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks some requirements dictated in the man page. The `-vn` option is used incorrectly. In `ffmpeg`, options are applied to the next specified file. The command structure must ensure that each output file only receives its relevant options before its specification. Thus, the command's options do not adhere to the expected ordering and construction described in the `ffmpeg` man page.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output contains the issue described, meaning it fails. The command produced is not valid as intended for the user requirement."
