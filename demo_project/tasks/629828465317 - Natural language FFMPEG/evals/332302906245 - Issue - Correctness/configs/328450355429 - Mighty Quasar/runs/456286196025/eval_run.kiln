  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to convert a video using both libx264 and libx265 codecs at the same time for maximum device compatibility. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nI know that using both codecs means the output should be in a container that supports multiple video streams. WebM or MP4? But WebM doesn't support H.265. MP4 is more common, but traditionally, MP4 containers usually have a single video stream. Wait, I think some containers like MKV or MP4 with HEVC (libx265) can also have H.264, but I'm not sure if MP4 supports multiple video streams. Maybe using MKV as the container would be better, since it supports multiple codec streams. Alternatively, some sources say that MP4 can have multiple video streams, but compatibility on all devices might be an issue. \n\nBut the user wants maximum compatibility. MKV is very flexible, but maybe some older devices may not play MKV. But the user is asking for simultaneous codecs, so I need to explain the options.\n\nWait, maybe the user wants to have both H.264 and H.265 in the same file. But most systems can only play one video stream at a time. So the idea is to put both codecs in the same container, so devices can choose which one to use. But in practice, probably only one will be used, but it depends on the player.\n\nSo the steps would be to encode the original video into both H.264 and H.265, then combine them into a single container. The container needs to support multiple video streams. MKV is a good choice here.\n\nSo the command would first encode the video to H.264 and H.265, then map both into the output. Let me look up the correct ffmpeg syntax. For example, using -c copy for audio if needed, but the user didn't mention audio, but we should probably keep the original audio. Wait, the user didn't specify audio, but typically you would encode audio as well. But the user's focus is on the video codecs. So maybe just ensure the audio is compatible. Maybe use AAC for audio, which is compatible with both H.264 and H.265 videos.\n\nSo, the command would have two -c:v options with libx264 and libx265, each with their mapping, then the output container. But how to do multiple encoders? Oh, right, using multiple -c:v options and mapping the video to each. But wait, each -c:v applies to the next input. Wait, no, in the same input, maybe using input stream mapping. Alternatively, you can use the hstack or vstack filters, but that's not what they want. Or, perhaps map the same input video to two different encoders. \n\nWait, the correct approach is to first map the video input to two different encoders. So the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2M -c:v libx265 -b:v 4M -c:a copy output_format.\n\nBut actually, this isn't correct because you need to map each encoder to a separate stream. You need to specify the input mapping for each video codec. Hmm. Wait, the -map option is needed here. So for example:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -map 0:v -c:v libx265 -map 0:a -c:a aac output.mkv\n\nBut that way, the video is mapped twice and each is encoded into H.264 and H.265. Then the output is MKV which supports multiple video streams. The audio is mapped once and encoded as AAC. The user didn't specify audio encoding, but for max compatibility, AAC is safe.\n\nSo the command would be along those lines. Also, the user might need to adjust bitrate settings for each codec. But the user didn't specify, so default parameters can be used, but that might be warned about. Maybe suggest using recommended presets and CRF for quality.\n\nBut to address compatibility, the audio should probably be in AAC. Also, the container needs to be mkv since mp4 doesn't support multiple video streams in practice. Or is that accurate?\n\nWait, I think MP4 can technically have multiple video streams, but not all devices will play them. MKV is more reliable for that. So the example command would use mkv as output. \n\nAnother consideration: each video stream in the output should have different parameters. For example, using CRF for libx264 and 2pass for libx265, or whatever is appropriate. But for a basic example, maybe just use the default settings.\n\nSo putting it all together, the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:v copy (not, need separate maps for each). Wait, no, the -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -map 0:v -c:v libx265 -map 0:a -c:a aac output.mkv.\n\nWait, but the video is from the same input twice. So:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v libx264 -map 0:v libx265 -map 0:a aac -c:v libx264 -b:v 2M -c:v libx265 -b:v 3M output.mkv\n\nWait, but this structure might not work. Because the -map 0:v is for each video stream. The -c:v options would set the codec for each video stream. So maybe:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0 -c:v:0 libx264 -c:v:1 libx265 -c:a aac -c:s copy -movflags +faststart output.mkv\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's look up the correct syntax. The correct way is to use -map 0:v -c:v libx264 for the first video stream, then another -map 0:v -c:v libx265 for the second video stream, then the audio, and map all into the output.\n\nSo the command is:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -map 0:v -c:v libx265 -x265-params preset=fast:crf=28 -map 0:a -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mkv\n\nBut movflags are for MP4, so if the output is mkv, maybe -movflags isn't needed. So for mkv, that part is unnecessary.\n\nThe output container should be MKV because it supports multiple video streams. But to get maximum compatibility, maybe explain that.\n\nSo the final command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -map 0:v -c:v libx265 -x265-params \"preset=fast:crf=28\" -map 0:a -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mkv\n\nBut the user didn't specify audio, but it's good to encode the audio in AAC for compatibility.\n\nSo the explanation would be:\n\nEncode the input video into both H.264 and H.265, and encode the audio as AAC. Each has its own codec parameters. Use MKV as the container, which supports multiple video streams. The result is a single file with two video codecs for maximum compatibility across devices that support either.\n\nAlso, note that the user needs to have both x264 and x265 libraries installed. Some systems may require extra steps to make sure those are available in ffmpeg. But for the example, the command is valid assuming the user has those codecs enabled.\n\nSo the answer should explain all that and the command.\n</think>\n\nTo achieve maximum device compatibility by using both H.264 and HEVC (libx265) codecs in a single result, the most reliable approach is to encode the video into **two separate video streams** and the audio (AAC) within an **MKV container**. MKV supports multiple video codecs in a single file, which most modern devices can adapt to. For older devices that only support H.264, theyâ€™ll use the H.264 stream, and for newer devices supporting HEVC, the HEVC stream will offer higher efficiency.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-map 0:v` twice to encode two video streams (H.264 and HEVC).\n- Use `-map 0:a` for a single AAC audio stream.\n- Apply standard `x264` CRF and `x265` CRF for consistent quality.\n- Use `mkv` as the container to preserve multiple streams.\n- Avoid legacy containers like MP4, which often struggle with multiple video streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 \\\n  -map 0:v -c:v libx265 -x265-params \"preset=main:crf=28\" \\\n  -map 0:a -c:a aac -b:a 128k \\\n  output.mkv\n```\n\nNotes",
