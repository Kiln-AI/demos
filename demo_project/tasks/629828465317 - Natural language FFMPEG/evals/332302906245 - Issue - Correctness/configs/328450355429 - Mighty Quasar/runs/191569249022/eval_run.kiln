Indeed, the command described is nonsensical when taken literally, as no single FFmpeg command can fulfill the text's intricate and inconsistent directives. If the intention is indeed to use FFmpeg, an appropriate task should be formulated with clear input and output files and the specific transformations or filters required. Can you please reframe your request with a focus on what you'd like to achieve using FFmpeg, possibly including a video file you'd like to rotate or an audio segment you want to reduce noise on, and what your desired output should be?",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues as it generates an invalid and nonsensical command string. The command string includes complex filters and incorrect syntax, making it impossible for FFmpeg to interpret or execute it properly. The filters and options are not formatted correctly according to FFmpeg's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example since it produces an entirely garbled command. The command is not syntactically valid, similar to the example where a non-existent preset is used; here, there is an inappropriate concatenation of parameters and a lack of clear, understandable directives.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break requirements dictated in the man page. The filters specified (like `deshake`) and the way they are formatted is not valid. The command consists of a series of parameters and operations that are not recognized by FFmpeg. The man page requires options to reflect valid FFmpeg filters and syntax, none of which is present in the model's produced command.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output contains multiple issues as described, which complicates, if not outright prevents, the ability for the command to work correctly. Therefore, it fails to meet the expectations for valid FFmpeg command generation."
