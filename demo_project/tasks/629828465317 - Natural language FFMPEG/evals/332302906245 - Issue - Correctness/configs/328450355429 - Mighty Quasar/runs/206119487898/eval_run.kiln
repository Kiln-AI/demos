  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the third audio stream (index 2) and the first video stream (index 0) from movie.mkv, use the `-map` option to selectively choose specific streams. Since stream indices are 0-based, the third audio track will be at index 2 (video is always the first 0, then audio tracks follow). The output will be remuxed into an MP4 container.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from the first input file.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream from the first input file.\n- `-c copy` performs a stream copy without re-encoding (fastest and lossless).\n- Assumes the video codec (likely H.264) and audio codec (likely AAC) are already MP4-compatible. If you need re-encoding (e.g., for non-MP4 codecs), replace `-c copy` with specific encoders like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is correctly formed and meets the user's request of extracting specific audio and video streams from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly uses valid options and parameters from the ffmpeg command line tool, and none of the parameters where incorrectly applied or undefined.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly maps selected streams and incorporates a stream copy (with `-c copy`) which is indeed suitable for remuxing without re-encoding. The mapping indices used (0:v:0 and 0:a:2) are appropriate given that they start from zero (the video stream index and the third audio track index).\n\n4) Since the model's output passes all checks and meets the requirements, it is deemed correct."
