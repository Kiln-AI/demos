  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mkv` and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate, you can use the `aac` audio codec for higher quality (though MP3 is not the most optimal for quality), or `libmp3lame` for true MP3 encoding. Since you specified MP3, we'll use `libmp3lame` and set the bitrate to the maximum supported value (320k) for the highest audio quality.\n\n- -vn disables video stream.\n- -acodec libmp3lame specifies the MP3 audio codec.\n- -ab 320k sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps, which is the maximum for MP3.\n- -ar 44100 sets the sample rate to 44.1 kHz, standard for high-quality audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -acodec libmp3lame -ab 320k -ar 44100 output.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not seem to contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears correct and matches the user's request of extracting audio and saving it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.\n\n2) The modelâ€™s output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is valid and does not contain any non-existent options. Each option used conforms to the requirements specified by the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options utilized, such as `-vn`, `-acodec libmp3lame`, `-ab 320k`, and `-ar 44100`, are valid and correctly used according to the synopsis and description provided in the man page. \n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the described issue. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation. The command is correct and fits the user's requirement of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as a high-quality MP3."
