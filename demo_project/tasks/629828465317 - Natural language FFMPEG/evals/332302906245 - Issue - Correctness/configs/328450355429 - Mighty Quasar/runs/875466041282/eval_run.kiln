  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mkv` and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate, use the `libmp3lame` encoder and set the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (standard maximum for MP3). The `-vn` flag disables video, and `-b:a 320k` ensures the highest possible audio quality. Note that MP3 is a lossy format, but 320 kbps is the best quality available.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is syntactically correct and follows the requirements provided by the user: extracting audio from a video file and saving it in MP3 format with the specified audio bitrate. The command appears to be valid according to FFmpeg syntax.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The example shows a command that includes an invalid preset (`extra_fast`). In this case, the model's command correctly uses valid FFmpeg options and parameters for audio extraction and encoding.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used are consistent with FFmpeg's syntax, and all specified parameters (`-vn`, `-c:a libmp3lame`, `-b:a 320k`) are valid and applicable for achieving the desired outcome described by the user. The model has correctly indicated the maximum bitrate for MP3 files as 320 kbps, which is the standard.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation as it correctly fulfills the user's request with a valid ffmpeg command."
