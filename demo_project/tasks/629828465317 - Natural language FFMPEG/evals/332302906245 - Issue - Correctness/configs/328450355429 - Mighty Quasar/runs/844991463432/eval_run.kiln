  "input": "I want to convert my video.avi to MOV format using the nvenc_h265 encoder with ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert your `video.avi` file to MOV format using the **nvenc_h265** encoder with the **ultrafast** preset, `ffmpeg` will encode the video into the HEVC (H.265) format using NVIDIA GPU acceleration (assuming you have an NVIDIA GPU with NVENC support). The `ultrafast` preset is the fastest but least optimized for compression, so the output will be larger in file size.\n\nKey parameters and assumptions:\n- Input file: `video.avi`\n- Output file: `output.mov` (you can choose a different name if needed)\n- Encoder: `hevc_nvenc` (also known as **nvenc_h265**)\n- Preset: `ultrafast` (controls encoding speed/quality tradeoff)\n- Audio is copied as-is (assuming itâ€™s already in a supported format like AAC)\n- Container format: `.mov` is specified for output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mov\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command is properly structured and matches the user requirements for converting `video.avi` to MOV format using the `nvenc_h265` encoder with the `ultrafast` preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command constructed by the model correctly uses existing ffmpeg options and does not refer to any nonexistent presets or options.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, the video codec (using `hevc_nvenc` which is a valid codec for H.265 encoding using NVIDIA hardware acceleration), and the audio codec as `copy`, which is appropriate when no audio re-encoding is necessary.\n\n4) Since the model's output correctly generates a valid and working `ffmpeg` command based on the user requirements and aligns with the documentation provided, it passes all evaluation criteria set forth. There are no issues present. \n\nConclusion: The model's output is valid and performs well for the task at hand. It does not fail any of the specified checks."
