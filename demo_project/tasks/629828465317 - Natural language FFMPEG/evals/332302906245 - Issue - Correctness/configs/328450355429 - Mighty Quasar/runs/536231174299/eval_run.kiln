  "input": "Convert my audio file song.wav to MP3 format with ultra_high quality preset and 320k bitrate",
  "output": "To convert song.wav to an MP3 file with ultra-high quality preset and 320 kbps bitrate, use the libmp3lame encoder with the `extremely_high` preset (or `very_high` for wider compatibility and faster processing). The 320k bitrate ensures high audio quality.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` selects the LAME MP3 encoder.\n- `-preset extremely_high` offers maximum quality with slower encoding.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps, which is near-CD quality for MP3.\n- This approach is standard for creating MP3 files from WAV with the best quality preservation.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -preset extremely_high -b:a 320k song.mp3\n```\n\nThis assuming your input file is named `song.wav` and you want the resulting file to be `song.mp3`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it provided (`ffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -preset extremely_high -b:a 320k song.mp3`) uses valid syntax with recognized parameters and formats. Therefore, it successfully meets the user's request to convert a WAV file to MP3 at the specified quality and bitrate.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The provided command uses valid preset options for audio encoding with `libmp3lame`, which is a standard MP3 encoder, and includes a correct bitrate setting. The command given does not cite a non-existent preset, which is what makes the failure example an issue.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The parameters used (`-c:a`, `-preset`, and `-b:a`) are correctly applied per the standard usage of ffmpeg options, and they maintain proper ordering based on input and output file specifications. Also, the bitrate setting aligns with the parameters listed in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and meets the user's requirements. It successfully transforms the audio file as requested without any mistakes in the command generation. Therefore, it passes the evaluation without issues."
