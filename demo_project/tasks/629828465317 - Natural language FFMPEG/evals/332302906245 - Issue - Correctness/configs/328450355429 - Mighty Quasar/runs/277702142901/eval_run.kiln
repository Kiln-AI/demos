  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg, specifying the input file and the stream indices you want to select. Stream indices start at 0, so for video stream 12 and audio stream 25, you would use `-map 0:v:12` for the video and `-map 0:a:25` for the audio.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your video and audio streams are in the same input file (`recording.mkv`).\n- The streams you're selecting are indeed a video and an audio stream (the command doesn't verify this).\n- You want to copy the streams without re-encoding them, which is what `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` do. If you need to re-encode, you would replace `copy` with your chosen codec.\n\nThis command simply copies the specified streams to a new file (`output.mkv`), without altering their format or content.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the input file \"recording.mkv.\" The command is appropriate for the user's request, so it aligns with the requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command is valid and does not include any non-existent options or erroneous syntax like the `-preset extra_fast` which fails due to being an invalid preset. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command follows the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` options to select specific streams from the input file and uses `-c:v copy -c:a copy` which is valid as it indicates to copy the streams without re-encoding. There are no errors or omissions concerning the synopses or descriptions provided.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command works correctly for the task as specified by the user."
