  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To set a high bitrate for both the audio and video, you can adjust the `-b:a` and `-b:v` parameters respectively. Specifically, for H.264 video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 512k -b:v 100000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nHere, we are **assuming**:\n- AAC audio codec with high quality/ bitrate\n- Higher video bitrate and lower bit rate for both source and destination input\n\nThe above assumes the best quality possible under the given constraints.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid and meets the user's request for a high bitrate of 100000k for video and 512k for audio. The parameters used correspond to the requirements stated in the user's input.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command provided by the model is coherent and syntactically correct. It employs recognized options and parameters that align with ffmpeg's functionality.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nBased on the provided man page, the command generated by the model adheres to the guidelines, as it uses valid options and parameters. Specifically, setting the audio and video bitrates using `-b:a` and `-b:v`, respectively, is consistent with the usage outlined in the FFmpeg documentation. There are no violations of the command’s requirements as specified.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output should **pass** as it does not contain the issue. The generated command is valid and functional according to user requirements and ffmpeg’s documentation."
