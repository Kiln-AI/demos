  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file and map them to an output file, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. Here, `-map 0:3` selects the video stream from stream index 3 of the first input (index 0), and `-map 0:5` selects the audio stream from stream index 5. The output container is MP4, so the command will also copy the streams without re-encoding to be fast and avoid quality loss (assuming the codecs are compatible).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nThis copies the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 directly into `edited.mp4` without re-encoding.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the criteria provided.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The output does not contain any issues. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4`) correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file as requested by the user. It uses the `-map` option correctly, and `-c copy` is appropriate for copying streams without re-encoding.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The example shows a command with an invalid preset (`-preset extra_fast`) which does not exist, indicating a syntax issue. In contrast, the model's command is valid and correctly formatted according to `ffmpeg` syntax guidelines.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break any requirements from the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly specifies input with `-i`, uses `-map` for stream selection, and applies `-c copy` for copying the streams directly into the output file. All components align with the syntax and usage rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. It produces a valid and correctly formatted `ffmpeg` command that fulfills the user's request.\n\n**Final Conclusion:** The model's output is accurate and meets the requirements, therefore, it passes all evaluations."
