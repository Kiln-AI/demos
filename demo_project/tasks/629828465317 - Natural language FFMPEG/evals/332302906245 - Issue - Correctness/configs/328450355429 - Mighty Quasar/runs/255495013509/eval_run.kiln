  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set a specific video and audio bitrate for optimal streaming, use the -b:v option for video bitrate and -b:a for audio bitrate. These options instruct ffmpeg to target your specified bitrates, which helps maintain consistent quality and bandwidth usage for streaming.\n\n- -b:v 10000000 sets the video bitrate to 10,000,000 bits per second (10 Mbps).\n- -b:a 1000k sets the audio bitrate to 1,000 kbps.\n- For best streaming compatibility, use H.264 for video and AAC for audio.\n- Use -maxrate and -bufsize for more stable bitrate control in streaming scenarios.\n- -movflags +faststart for MP4 files ensures faster playback start.\n\nAssuming your input is input.mp4 and you want to output as output.mp4 for streaming, hereâ€™s a recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000000 -maxrate 10000000 -bufsize 20000000 -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis sets the video to 10 Mbps, audio to 1 Mbps, and optimizes the MP4 for web streaming. Adjust input/output filenames as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command accurately specifies the video bitrate, audio bitrate, and uses widely accepted encoding options while maintaining the order of options correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output with a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`). The command provided by the model uses valid ffmpeg options and parameters, such as `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`, which are proper codecs. It also correctly sets bitrates and employs additional flags that enhance the command's streaming capabilities.\n\n3) The command generated respects the requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It makes appropriate use of options such as `-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, and `-movflags`. All options are valid, and they follow the guidelines for setting up bitrates and output format for streaming.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluation points, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus, it passes the evaluation. It effectively meets the user's request for setting specific bitrates while maintaining correct syntax and valid options usage."
