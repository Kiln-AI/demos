  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds as PNG images at the video's original resolution (no scaling), use the ffmpeg -vf fps filter with a 0.5 Hz frame rate (which means 0.5 frames per second). Each frame will be extracted as a PNG file named with sequential numbers (e.g., frame01.png).\n\n- -vsync 0 disables frame duplication or dropping, ensuring accurate 2-second interval extraction.\n- -qs:v 2 or -q:v 19 sets output quality (not necessary for PNG but good practice for quality control if switching formats).\n- The output file pattern frame%02d.png creates sequential zero-padded filenames for easy sorting and use.\n\nAssuming the input video is in its original resolution and you want to extract every 2 seconds at full resolution:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=0.5\" -q:v 2 frame%02d.png\n```\n\nThis command extracts one frame every 2 seconds stamps them with high PNG quality and preserves the original resolution for ultra-high quality output.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generates should, in theory, work correctly for the specified task, which is to extract frames from a video file every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images. The options it provided are consistent with the need to extract frames at the proper interval.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it produces is not attempting to use an invalid preset or option like `extra_fast`. Instead, it appears to be logically constructed to accomplish the extraction of frames.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements laid out in the ffmpeg man page. All options used (such as `-vf`, `-vsync`, and the output file naming pattern) are correctly applied and in line with the general use of ffmpeg commands described in the man page. \n\n4) Therefore, the response passes all checks and does not contain any issues. It correctly provides a command that matches the user's request and adheres to the specifications defined in the ffmpeg documentation. The assumptions made about the input video format and the quality of extraction will generally align with the user's needs (i.e., choosing to maintain maximum resolution)."
