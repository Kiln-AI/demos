  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams with FFmpeg, use the `-map` option. Streams are zero-indexed, so:\n\n- The third video stream is `0:v:2`.\n- The second audio stream is `0:a:1`.\n- The default codecs for MP4 containers are H.264 for video and AAC for audio, so transcode if the input is not already in a compatible format.\n\nThis command copies only the specified streams from `multi.avi` and encodes to standard codecs if necessary:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart final.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes you want to re-encode for compatibility, as direct stream copying (`-c copy`) may fail if the source codecs aren’t MP4-compatible. If you know the streams are H.264/AAC already, you could use `-c copy` for faster processing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain issues as described in the issue description. The command generated appears to satisfy the user's request for mapping specific streams correctly.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid and follows the correct syntax of `ffmpeg`. There are no syntactic or semantic errors apparent in the command.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used, such as `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`, are valid and correctly applied to the specified input and output. \n\nOverall, the model successfully generated a correct `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements without falling into the described issues or generating errors based on the man page. Therefore, it successfully passes all evaluations."
