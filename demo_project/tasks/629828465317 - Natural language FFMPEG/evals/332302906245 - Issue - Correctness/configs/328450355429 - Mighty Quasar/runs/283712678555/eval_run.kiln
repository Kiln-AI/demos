  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio as both MP3 at 320 kbps and WAV simultaneously, you can use ffmpeg's complex filter to split the audio stream into two outputs. The MP3 will be encoded with high quality (320 kbps), and the WAV will be lossless. \n\nAssuming your input file is named `input.mp4`, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:a]split=2[a1][a2]\" -map \"[a1]\" -c:a mp3 -b:a 320k output.mp3 -map \"[a2]\" -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n``` \n\nThis command splits the audio stream into two separate outputs without re-encoding unnecessarily, outputting both desired formats in one run.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly extracts audio from a video input file and simultaneously creates both MP3 and WAV formats as requested by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command produced by the model is syntactically and semantically correct, and it does not contain any invalid options or formats that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-i` option for the input file, the `-filter_complex` option to split the audio to two separate outputs, and uses appropriate codec options for MP3 and WAV formats. The mappings and codec specifications are in accordance with the rules set by the ffmpeg documentation. \n\n4) Overall, the model's output is accurate and meets the user's requirements without issues. The command is correctly structured and utilizes valid parameters as per ffmpeg's requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
