  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from a multi-track input file into a new MP4 output, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg` to specify the stream indices. This ensures that only the 6th video stream and 9th audio stream are included in the output file.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file has at least 9 audio streams and 6 video streams.\n- Stream indices are 0-based (i.e., the first stream is 0, the second is 1, etc.).\n- You want to retain the original codecs and settings unless otherwise specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:5 -map 0:a:8 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:5` selects the 6th video stream (index 5).\n- `-map 0:a:8` selects the 9th audio stream (index 8).\n- The output file `output.mp4` will contain only the specified video and audio streams.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to map the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file. It adheres to the user's request, ensuring that the command matches the requirements and functions as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The output command is valid and correctly formats the `ffmpeg` syntax for stream mapping, while the failure example presented an invalid preset option which does not exist.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the `-map` option in the appropriate order and does not violate any syntax rules outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should be marked as passing the evaluation."
