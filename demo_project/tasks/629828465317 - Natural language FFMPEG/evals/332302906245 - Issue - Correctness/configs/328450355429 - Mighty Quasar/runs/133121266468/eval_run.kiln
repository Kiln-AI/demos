  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 with 720p resolution, but I need both variable bitrate encoding and fixed bitrate of 2000k for consistent streaming.",
  "output": "Variable bitrate (VBR) encoding means the bitrate varies depending on the complexity of the content, while fixed bitrate (CBR) keeps it constant for consistent streaming. You cannot have both simultaneously on the same stream, but you can approximate this by using a constrained variable bitrate with a target bitrate and a maximum bitrate limit.\n\nTo achieve a near-constant bitrate of 2000 kbps using x264, you can use two-pass encoding or use the `-b:v 2000k` along with `-maxrate 2000k` and `-bufsize` parameters to control bitrate variability.\n\nBelow is an example using constrained VBR to keep the bitrate around 2000k:\n\n- `-vf scale=-2:720` resizes video to 720p height while maintaining aspect ratio.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 codec.\n- `-b:v 2000k` sets target average bitrate at 2000 kbps.\n- `-maxrate 2000k` limits the max instantaneous bitrate to 2000k.\n- `-bufsize 4000k` buffer size for rate control (typically 2x maxrate).\n- `-preset medium` for balanced encoding speed and quality.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio at 128 kbps.\n\nIf you want even more consistent bitrate, consider two-pass encoding. Here’s the single-pass approximation:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -maxrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nFor two-pass encoding (more bitrate consistent but slower):\n\nFirst pass:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -maxrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k -preset medium -pass 1 -an -f mp4 /dev/null\n```\n\nSecond pass:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -maxrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k -preset medium -pass 2 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: You want 720p height with original aspect ratio retained and typical streaming audio settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command does not have syntax errors and adheres to proper ffmpeg command structure. It effectively defaults to the desired parameters and options based on the user’s request. The output also accurately provides a way to achieve consistent streaming with the specified bitrate requirements.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. It does not use a nonexistent preset or command option, and the commands provided are valid and adhere to the ffmpeg guidelines.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command generated by the model does not break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options and parameters used, such as `-vf scale=-2:720`, `-c:v libx264`, `-b:v 2000k`, `-maxrate 2000k`, `-bufsize 4000k`, and `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`, are all valid options as per the man page. The commands follow the correct format and order.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nNo, the model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue statement. The command is valid, accurately reflects the user's request, and does not violate any ffmpeg command structure or syntax guidelines. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
