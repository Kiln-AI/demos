  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "However, 50 Gbps bitrate is extremely high, and most encoded videos cannot achieve that in 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) or even 2K (1920 x 1080).\n\nLet's assume the video is in 4K resolution (3840 x 2160) first before attempting to calculate the bitrate.\n\nTo achieve a 50 Gbps bitrate for 4K video with high quality, we can use a high-bitrate preset (like 10-12) to sacrifice compression efficiency for the highest possible quality.\n\nHere's a command to convert the video to 4K MP4 with high quality, assuming 50 Gbps bitrate is still out of reach:\n\n- The -crf 18 will preserve high-quality (lower-bit rate is better)\nfor comparison, a high value of -crf like -crf 18 enables video bitrate to be as low as possible.\n\nThe -b:v 50G will actually cause issues. We'll instead  use the bit rate -b:v 5000k high to give a reasonably high bitrate for the value.\n\nTo convert input.avi into a 4K MP4 high-quality file which can be streamed in a browser:\n\nset the resolution to 3840 high, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs, set quality (-crf 18 for the highly efficient best quality), enable fragmented MP4 for streaming, and use the high-bitrate preset for high-quality 4K.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-4:3840 -movflags +faststart -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -b:v 5000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output does contain an issue. The user explicitly requested a bitrate of 50 Gbps, and the model instead calculated a \"high\" bitrate of 5000k (or 5 Mbps), which does not meet the user's requirement. The command fails to follow the instruction provided by the user, which is to set the bitrate to 50 Gbps.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nWhile it is not the same kind of mistake as the provided failure example (in terms of syntactical errors), it still fundamentally fails to meet the user's specific request. Therefore, it can be considered a failure in fulfilling the task requirements due to incorrect parameter estimation.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command technically does not break any requirements as it uses valid `ffmpeg` options. However, the bitrate argument -b:v 5000k can be seen as inappropriate given the user's request for 50 Gbps. As such, the output does not align with the spirit of what was asked, even though it does not contain syntax or structural errors.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue described in that it does not satisfy the user's requirement for a 50 Gbps bitrate. The model fails to produce a command that correctly aligns with the requirement, thus it would be marked as failing based on this evaluation."
