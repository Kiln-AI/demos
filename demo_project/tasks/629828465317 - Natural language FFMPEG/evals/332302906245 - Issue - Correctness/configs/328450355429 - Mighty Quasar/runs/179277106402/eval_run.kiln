  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert `video.webm` to MP4 format using the libvpx-vp9 codec in constant bitrate (CRF) mode, we'll use VP9 video encoding and specify a quality level with CRF. CRF 0 (best quality) to 51 (worst quality) is supported with libvpx-vp9. A value of 23 is a good default for a good balance between quality and file size.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` specifies the VP9 codec for the video.\n- `-crf 23` sets the quality level; 23 is a balanced setting, but you can adjust based on specific needs.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding, which saves processing time and bandwidth if the audio format is already compatible with MP4 containers.\n- `output.mp4` is the resulting file name.\n\nAssuming the audio format in `video.webm` is already compatible and can be directly copied into the MP4 container, this command will convert your video efficiently while retaining the original audio quality. If you need to re-encode the audio, the codec can be specified.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the aforementioned issue; the generated command correctly converts `video.webm` to MP4 format using the libvpx-vp9 codec with an appropriate parameter for constant bitrate (CRF mode). The CRF value and other parameters used are valid for ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is well-structured and adheres to ffmpeg syntax, whereas the failing example indicated an invalid preset. \n\n3) Reviewing the command against the ffmpeg man page, there are no apparent violations or requirements that are broken. The command's structure, options, and arguments are appropriate for the desired parameters.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct. There are no issues present in the command generated, it meets all the user requirements, and adheres to the syntax of ffmpeg. Thus, it passes the evaluation criteria."
