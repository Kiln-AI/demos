  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge multiple MP4 files seamlessly, it's best to use a method that doesn't re-encode the videos, preserving quality and speeding up the process. This requires that all input files have the same codec, resolution, and codec parameters.\n\nFirst, create a text file listing all the files to merge:\n\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\nAssuming you've saved this list as `file_list.txt`, you can then run ffmpeg with the concat demuxer:\n\n- The `-f concat` specifies concatenation mode.\n- `-safe 0` allows file paths/filenames with unsafe characters.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams directly without re-encoding.\n\n**Note:** It's important that all files have identical codecs and formats.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy merged_output.mp4\n```\n\nIf the files differ in codec parameters, re-encoding them into a common format is necessary, but in this case, the above method is best suited for identical files.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is correct and aligns with the user's request to merge three video files into one continuous video file without re-encoding, and the explanation clarifies the necessary requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output since the command shared is valid and adheres to FFmpeg's syntax and requirements. The output command will work correctly for merging the files listed in the txt file.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used in the command (`-f concat`, `-safe 0`, `-i file_list.txt`, `-c copy`) are all valid and correctly applied according to the syntax defined in the man page.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and should pass the evaluation. The generated command is accurate and aligned with the task requirements."
