  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in the correct order, you should process them sequentially: temporal first (works across frames), then spatial (works within frames), then edge enhancement (sharpens details after cleaning).\n\nThe correct order is important because:\n1. **Temporal noise reduction** (bm3d or hqdn3d) - removes noise across time/frames first\n2. **Spatial denoising** (nlmeans or bm3d spatial) - cleans up remaining spatial noise within frames\n3. **Edge enhancement** (unsharp) - sharpens details after the image is clean\n\nHere's the filter chain syntax using commonly available filters:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5,nlmeans=s=4:p=7:r=15,unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nFilter explanations:\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5` - High quality temporal denoiser (luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_temporal:chroma_temporal)\n- `nlmeans=s=4:p=7:r=15` - Non-local means spatial denoiser (strength:patch_size:research_window)\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0` - Edge enhancement (luma_matrix:luma_amount:chroma_matrix:chroma_amount)\n\nAlternative with different filters:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"bm3d=sigma=3:block=8:bstep=4,nlmeans=s=3,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=0.8\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: Adjust strength values based on your source material - higher values = more aggressive processing.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be syntactically correct and utilizes valid ffmpeg filters. It specifies a filter chain that appropriately matches the user's request for applying temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in the correct order, which aligns with the requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the provided failure example. The command generated is valid and does not reference any invalid presets or options. It consists of recognized filters and adheres to the expected syntax of ffmpeg commands.\n\n3) The command does **not break** any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All used filters, options, and parameters are valid according to the documentation, and the command adheres to the formatting rules outlined in the man page.\n\nGiven this analysis, the modelâ€™s output is appropriate and meets the requirements specified by the user. Therefore, the overall evaluation indicates a **pass**."
