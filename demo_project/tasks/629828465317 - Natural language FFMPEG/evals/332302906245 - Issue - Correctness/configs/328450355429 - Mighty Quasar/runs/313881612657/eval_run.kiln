  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your video to H.265 format, you'll use the libx265 codec, which is a widely-used encoder for H.265/HEVC. The veryfast2 preset is a good choice for balancing encoding speed and compression efficiency.\n\n- c:v libx265 sets the video codec to H.265.\n- preset veryfast2 sets the encoding preset to veryfast2 for better compression.\n- crf 28 sets the quality (lower is better; 28 is a reasonable starting point for H.265).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 -crf 28 output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Your input file is named \"input.mp4\". Replace this with your actual input file name and format.\n- The resolution and audio settings from the input file are adequate and don't need changes.\n- You're using a compatible FFmpeg version that includes libx265 support.\n\nNote that the H.265 codec is more CPU-intensive than H.264. The `veryfast2` preset will take longer to encode, but should result in better compression than the `ultrafast` or `superfast` presets.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears valid and should work correctly based on the user request to convert a video into H.265 format with the specified preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 -crf 28 output.mp4`) uses valid options and syntax, and does not include any preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All specified options are valid, correctly applied to the input and output file context, and follow the correct order.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain any issues as specified. Therefore, it passes the evaluation. "
