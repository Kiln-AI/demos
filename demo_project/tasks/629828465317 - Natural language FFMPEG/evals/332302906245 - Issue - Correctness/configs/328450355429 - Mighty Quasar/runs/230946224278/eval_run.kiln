  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To extract the original video stream and specifically map the third audio stream from movie.mkv, you can use the -map option in ffmpeg. The -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream from the input, and -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream (indexing starts at 0).\n\nThis command assumes you want to copy the streams without re-encoding (for speed and to avoid quality loss) and output to an MKV container, which handles most codecs well. If you want to re-encode or use a different container, let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream from the first input.\n- -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream (streams are zero-indexed).\n- -c copy tells ffmpeg to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n\nThis will result in a new video file with the original video and only the third audio track.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output does not contain the described issue. It correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that meets the user requirements: extracting the original video stream and mapping only the third audio stream from the input file `movie.mkv`. The chosen options (`-map` and `-c copy`) are appropriate for this task and comply with the requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model is correct, with valid syntax and flags. There are no incorrect or non-existent options, unlike the example provided where `-preset extra_fast` was an invalid option.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It successfully uses the `-map` feature to select specific streams from the input, and it employs `-c copy` to output the streams without re-encoding, which is correctly applied. There is nothing in the command that contradicts the supplied options in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nConsidering the analysis above, the output does not contain the issue described. The model generated a valid and working `ffmpeg` command that matches the userâ€™s requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
