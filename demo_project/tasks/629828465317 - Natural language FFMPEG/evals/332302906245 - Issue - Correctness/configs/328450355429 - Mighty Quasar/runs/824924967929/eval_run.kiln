  "output": "Sure! If you want to extract the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from `complex.avi` and place them in the output file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg` to specify the streams you want to include.\n\nHereâ€™s a detailed explanation:\n- The `-map 0:1` option selects the second video stream from the input file. In AVI files, streams are zero-indexed, so the second stream would be index 1.\n- The `-map 0:3` option selects the fourth audio stream from the input file. The fourth stream would be index 3.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **-i complex.avi**: Specifies the input file.\n- **-map 0:1**: Maps the second video stream from the input file.\n- **-map 0:3**: Maps the fourth audio stream from the input file.\n- **-c copy**: Uses a copy command to avoid re-encoding the streams, which is efficient if the streams are in a compatible format already.\n- **output.mp4**: The output file name.\n\nThis command assumes that the second video and fourth audio are in a format that can be directly copied without re-encoding. If re-encoding is necessary, you would need to specify different codecs and settings.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated successfully maps the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from `complex.avi` to the output file, adhering to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mp4`) is valid and uses the `-map` options correctly to select the specified streams. The preset issue in the failure example is not present here.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly follows the syntax for input files, uses the `-map` option appropriately, and the `-c copy` option is valid for copying streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues described, it should pass the evaluation as it meets the requirements of the user input. The generated command is correct and aligns with the specified guidelines for using `ffmpeg`."
