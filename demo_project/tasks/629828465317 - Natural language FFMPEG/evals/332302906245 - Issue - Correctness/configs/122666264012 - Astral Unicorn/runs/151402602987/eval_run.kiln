I'll use a moderate CRF value for good quality balance.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.avi\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Uses libx265 for H.265/HEVC video encoding\n- Sets CRF 28 for balanced quality/size (lower values = higher quality)\n- Encodes audio with AAC at 128 kbps bitrate\n- Outputs to AVI container format",

    "reasoning": "**Analysis of the MKV to AVI Conversion Request**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a request to convert an MKV file to AVI using specific codecs: `libx265` for video and `aac` for audio. My immediate thought is, \"Wait a minute, is that going to work?\"  I need to dive into the details.\n\nFirst, I examine the provided `ffmpeg` command: It correctly identifies the input and output files and specifies the codecs as requested. However, the AVI container is raising a red flag.  My understanding is that AVI doesn't natively support H.265 (which `libx265` implements).  While hacks might exist, it's not a standard or reliable combination. Standard players will likely fail to process this combination. The same goes for the AAC audio stream inside an AVI file. It's technically possible, but not a standard setup and can cause issues with playback.\n\nTo verify, I ran a quick test with a similar command using `testsrc` video and the requested codecs. Just as I suspected, `ffmpeg` immediately threw an error stating that H.265 isn't supported in AVI.  My initial hypothesis is validated: the command *will* fail.\n\nGiven this, I have to conclude that the output is incorrect.  The user's request is flawed, and a helpful response should either explain the limitations or provide a working alternative, not a command that's guaranteed to fail. The system should be able to reason about codec compatibility within the AVI container and the user's overall goal, not just provide a blind echo of the provided parameters. The goal is to produce a *working* conversion."
