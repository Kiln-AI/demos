  "input": "My file `archive.mkv` has three audio tracks. I need to extract the second audio track and the main video track into a new file `output.mp4` without re-encoding anything.",
  "output": "To extract the second audio track and main video track without re-encoding, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` option and copy codecs to avoid transcoding. This preserves quality and processes much faster since no encoding occurs.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first (main) video stream\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (0-indexed, so index 1 is the second track)\n- `-c copy` copies both video and audio streams without re-encoding\n- The output container MP4 will remux the streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "reasoning": "**Assessing the FFMPEG Command for Track Extraction**\n\nOkay, so I'm thinking through this ffmpeg command I need. The user wants to pull out the main video and the *second* audio track from `archive.mkv` and dump them into `output.mp4` without re-encoding.  I understand the logic here: `0:v:0` for the video, the user's requesting to map the *first* video track, which is usually correct, and `-map 0:a:1` for the second audio track (remembering that ffmpeg streams are zero-indexed). Using `-c copy` is the right move to prevent a costly and unnecessary re-encoding step.\n\nNow, looking at the proposed command, I see a problem. The explanation is actually pretty solid. It correctly identifies `-map 0:a:1` as the key for grabbing the *second* audio stream. But the command itself... that's where things fall apart. It uses `-map 0:a:2`. That would grab the *third* audio track, not the second! \n\nI'm focusing on the command itself because that's what the user will copy. The user didn't ask me to explain ffmpeg, they are an expert, they just want me to spit out the correct command. Since the command is wrong, the entire response is effectively useless. The explanation is technically correct, but the *actionable* part (the command) is flawed. Fail."
