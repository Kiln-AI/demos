This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",

    "reasoning": "**Fusing Streams with ffmpeg**\n\nOkay, so I'm aiming to combine a specific video and audio stream from a multi-track MP4 file. The input is `multi_track.mp4`, and I want stream 2 (the third stream) as video and stream 7 (the eighth stream) as audio into a new, single output file. I'm going to leverage `ffmpeg` to accomplish this.\n\nFirst, I need to tell `ffmpeg` the input file: `-i multi_track.mp4`. That's straightforward. Then, I need to map the specific streams.  `ffmpeg` uses a zero-based indexing system, so the third stream is `0:2`, and the eighth stream is `0:7`. Using the `-map` flag, I'll select these streams: `-map 0:2` for the video and `-map 0:7` for the audio.\n\nSince I don't want to re-encode the streams (which would degrade quality and slow things down), I'll use `-c copy` to instruct `ffmpeg` to copy the codecs directly. Finally, I'll specify the output file name as `output.mp4`.\n\nThe resulting command, then, is `ffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4`. This should correctly mux the selected video and audio streams into a new MP4 container, maintaining the original quality and efficiency. It is important to note that the way the user phrased this, the model makes an accurate assumption of mapping streams requested, matching the user's intent."
