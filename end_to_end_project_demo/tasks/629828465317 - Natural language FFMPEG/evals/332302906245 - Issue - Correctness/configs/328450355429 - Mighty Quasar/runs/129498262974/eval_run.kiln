  "input": "Convert my audio file song.wav to MP3 format with ultra_high quality preset and 320k bitrate",
  "output": "To convert your `song.wav` audio file to MP3 with ultra-high quality and a 320 kbps bitrate, we use the `libmp3lame` encoder with the `-q:a 0` option (where 0 is the best quality for LAME MP3 encoding), and set the audio bitrate to 320 kbps. This ensures high-fidelity audio output.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is named `song.wav`.\n- The output file will be named `song.mp3`.\n- You have the LAME MP3 encoder available in your `ffmpeg` build (this is usually included by default).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 -b:a 320k song.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command seems correct and accurately matches the user's request for converting the audio file to MP3 format with the specified quality and bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i song.wav -codec:a libmp3lame -q:a 0 -b:a 320k song.mp3`) is a valid ffmpeg command that correctly applies the specified audio codec and bitrate. There are no invalid parameters or syntax errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used (`-i`, `-codec:a`, `-q:a`, and `-b:a`) follow the guidelines presented in the man page, and there are no conflicts regarding the order of options or their application to input and output files.\n\nOverall, the model's performance in this case is satisfactory and meets the task's requirements without any errors. It successfully generates a valid and appropriate ffmpeg command for the userâ€™s need for audio conversion. Therefore, it should pass."
