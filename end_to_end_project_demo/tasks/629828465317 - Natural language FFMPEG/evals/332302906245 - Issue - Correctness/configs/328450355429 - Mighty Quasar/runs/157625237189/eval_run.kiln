  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert a 5.1 surround sound video to stereo while mixing the rear channels at 50% volume, you can use ffmpeg's `pan` audio filter. This filter allows you to specify how each input channel maps to output channels, and you can include volume adjustments to specific channels.\n\nAssuming the input has 6 channels in the order: Front Left, Front Right, Center, Low Frequency (LFE), Rear Left, Rear Right, the command will:\n\n- Mix Rear Left and Rear Right channels into the stereo mix with 50% volume.\n- Sum Front Left, Front Right, and Center channels (with the rear channels at reduced volume).\n\nThe `pan` filter will combine and map channels accordingly.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:a]pan=stereo|c0=0.5*front_left + 0.5*rear_left + front_center|c1=0.5*front_right + 0.5*rear_right + front_center[aout]\" -map 0:v -map \"[aout]\" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -shortest output_stereo.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `pan=stereo|c0=…|c1=…` creates a stereo output with custom channel mapping.\n- The rear channels are mixed at 50% volume (`0.5*rear_left`, `0.5*rear_right`).\n- The front left/right plus center channels are summed to produce the stereo channels.\n- `-c:v copy` preserves the original video stream.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` re-encodes the audio to AAC at 192 kbps.\n- `-shortest` ensures the output duration matches the shortest input stream if they differ.\n\n**Assumption:** The input channels follow a standard 5.1 channel layout. If your channel order differs, the pan filter parameters should be adjusted accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appears to adequately address the user's request to convert 5.1 surround sound to stereo audio while mixing the rear channels at 50% volume. The parameters used in the `pan` filter are correctly set to achieve the desired audio effects.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model uses valid options correctly and does not contain any non-existent parameters or syntactical errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the proper syntax and includes valid options for audio processing, mapping, and encoding.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output should pass as it does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command provided correctly converts the audio as specified by the user, meeting all requirements."
