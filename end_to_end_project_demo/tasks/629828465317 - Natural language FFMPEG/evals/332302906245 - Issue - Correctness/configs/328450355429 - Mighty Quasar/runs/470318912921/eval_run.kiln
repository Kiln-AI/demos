  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically while combining their audio into one, the `vstack` video filter and `amix` audio filter are used. This assumes both videos have **identical resolution** (width and height) and matching aspect ratios. If resolutions differ, you'd need to scale them first. The output is encoded with H.264 and AAC for broad compatibility, similar to the example in your history.\n\n- `[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v]` combines the first input (`top_video.mp4`) and the second input (`bottom_video.mp4`) into a single vertical stack.\n- `[0:a][1:a]amix=inputs=2:duration=longest[a]` mixes the audio streams from both videos until the longest one ends.\n- `-map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\"` ensures the merged video and audio streams are included in the output.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` specify widely supported codecs.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with most players/encodes.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 \\\n-filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]vstack=inputs=2[v];[0:a][1:a]amix=inputs=2:duration=longest[a]\" \\\n-map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p \\\nstacked.mp4\n```\n\n**Key Assumptions**:\n1. Both inputs have the same resolution and aspect ratio.\n2. Both videos contain audio that needs mixing. To exclude audio, omit the audio filter and mapping arguments.\n3. The output is intended for playback compatibility with H.264/AAC.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is complete, correct in syntax, and fulfills the user request to stack two videos vertically. The explanation provided also aligns with the command, ensuring that it appropriately addresses the user's input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain a mistake like the non-existent `preset extra_fast` from the failure example. Instead, the command is structured correctly and uses existing `ffmpeg` parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. Each option is placed correctly in relation to the input files, and there are no conflicts. The use of `-filter_complex`, `-map`, and codec specifications complies with the expected conventions outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Given that the output does not contain any issues, errors, or conflicts with the `ffmpeg` man page, it passes all evaluation criteria. Thus, it should be considered a successful output that meets the user's requirements effectively."
