  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 10 Mbps (-b:v 10000k) and audio bitrate to 1 Mbps (-b:a 1000k), use H.264 video (-c:v libx264) and AAC audio (-c:a aac) codecs for streaming compatibility. Include `-movflags +faststart` to enable fast HTML5 playback and `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for broad device/browser support. No scaling is applied unless needed (assumed original resolution is acceptable).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000k -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The input file is named `input.mp4` (file type can be adjusted).\n- H.264 is required for streaming protocol compatibility.\n- The chosen video bitrate (10 Mbps) is suitable for the target resolution/quality (1080p/4K).\n- No resolution rescaling is needed unless specified, preserving the input's original dimensions.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nYes, the model correctly sets the video bitrate to 10 Mbps (-b:v 10000k) and audio bitrate to 1 Mbps (-b:a 1000k). The output does not contain any functional errors. All elements essential for a streaming setup, such as codec specifications and the use of `-movflags +faststart`, are included. Additionally, the assumption about no scaling needed unless specified is appropriate for this task.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The output does not contain any invalid commands or parameters that would lead to an error. All the specified commands are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements from the man page. The options used (-b:v, -b:a, -c:v, -c:a, -pix_fmt, -movflags) comply with FFmpeg's specifications. The order of the options is appropriate, and there are no incorrect parameters or unsupported option usages.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore it should pass this evaluation step. The command is valid, and all requirements have been addressed correctly."
