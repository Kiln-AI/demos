  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your file with a **constant video bitrate of 25,000 kbps**, use the `-b:v` parameter and ensure H.264 encoding (for compatibility). A constant bitrate is often used for streaming with strict bandwidth requirements, though such a high bitrate (25 Mbps) is typically reserved for high-quality HD/4K video. Since no resolution or audio changes were specified, I assume you want to maintain the original resolution and simply re-encode the video stream with the given bitrate, use AAC audio (at 128 kbps), and ensure MP4 container compatibility.\n\n- `-b:v 25000k` sets the fixed video bitrate.\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset fast` balances encoding speed and compression efficiency.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio using AAC at standard quality (128 kbps).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with MP4 players.\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows the file to stream in browsers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Input is a video file (extension like `.mkv`, `.avi`, etc. not specified, but `-i input` adapts to any format).  \n- You want the audio to remain compatible (AAC 128 kbps) even if the input uses a different codec.  \n- Youâ€™re okay with large output file sizes (25 Mbps is extremely high and not suitable for general use unless explicitly required).  \n- The original resolution and frame rate should stay unchanged.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated FFMpeg command correctly implements the user's requirement for a constant video bitrate of 25000k, and there aren't any mistakes in the command that would lead to failure. All parameters used correspond correctly to the FFMpeg documentation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. It does not contain any invalid parameters or flags such as an inexistent preset. The command is structured correctly and adheres to the requirements.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFMpeg. All parameters used in the command are valid and correctly assigned, according to the specified output conditions (constant bitrate and compatibility).\n\n4) Considering the evaluation, the output from the model should pass, as it correctly fulfills the task without any errors or improper format."
