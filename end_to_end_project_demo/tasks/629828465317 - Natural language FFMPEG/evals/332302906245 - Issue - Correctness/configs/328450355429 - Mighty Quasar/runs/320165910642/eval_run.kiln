To ensure maximum compression with the FLAC codec, use the `-compression_level 12` audio option (where 12 is the highest level of compression supported by FLAC).\n\n- -vn disables video processing.\n- -c:a flac selects the FLAC audio codec.\n- -compression_level 12 specifies maximum compression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nAssumption: The input file video.mp4 has at least one audio stream. If it has more, this will extract the first one by default.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command appears to correctly extract audio from a video file in a specified format using appropriate options. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not use a non-existent option or preset; all the options including `-compression_level` are valid for the FLAC codec.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax properly follows the ffmpeg format and uses supported options for audio extraction and the FLAC codec.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation criteria."
