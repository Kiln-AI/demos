  "input": "Can you set the bitrate to 100M for maximum quality when converting to MP4?",
  "output": "To set a specific bitrate for the video to achieve maximum quality, use the `-b:v` parameter. Setting it to 100M (100 Megabits per second) ensures high quality, but note that it results in a large file size. Using `libx264` with a high bitrate can produce very good quality output.\n\n- `-b:v 100M` sets the video bitrate to 100 Megabits per second.\n- You might want to include `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` to control bitrate variability for smooth playback.\n- Using CRF is typically a good compromise; specifying a fixed bitrate overrides CRF's quality-based approach, so for maximum quality with fixed bitrate, omit CRF or set it very low.\n\nAssuming you want to re-encode an input file to MP4 with maximum quality via 100M bitrate:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M -maxrate 100M -bufsize 200M -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n*Note:* This command prioritizes maximum quality at high bitrate. Adjust audio bitrate as needed for your target quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly applies the configuration as stated by the user request, setting a video bitrate of 100M for maximum quality when converting to MP4.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and accurately references existing FFmpeg options and codecs.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters are correctly used, specifying the video codec, bitrate, audio codec, and pertinent settings for MP4 conversion.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output is correct and does not contain the described issue. It successfully generates an appropriate command tailored to the user's request. The output adheres to FFmpeg's given structure and parameters."
