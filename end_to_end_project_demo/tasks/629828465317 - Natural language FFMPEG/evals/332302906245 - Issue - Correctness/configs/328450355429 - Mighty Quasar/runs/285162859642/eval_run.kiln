  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To downmix a 5.1 surround audio track to stereo while mixing the rear channels (typically channels 5 and 6: Surround Left and Right) at 50% volume, you can use the `-af` (audio filter) option with the `pan` filter. The pan filter allows customization of each output stereo channel as a combination of the input channels.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The order of channels in your MP4 is the standard 5.1 layout for ffmpeg: Front Left, Front Right, Center, LFE (Low Frequency Effects, subwoofer), Back Left, Back Right.\n- We will ignore (drop) the LFE channel for stereo mix, which is typical.\n- Rear channels (surrounds) are mixed in at half their original volume: 0.5.\n\nHere's how the pan filter would be structured:\n- Left = 1.0*Front Left + 0.707*Center + 0.5*Back Left\n- Right = 1.0*Front Right + 0.707*Center + 0.5*Back Right\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af \"pan=stereo|c0=FL+0.707FC+0.5BL|c1=FR+0.707FC+0.5BR\" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k concert_stereo.mp4\n```\n\n- `-af` applies the pan filter with the specified channel mapping.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` encodes audio to AAC stereo at 192 kbps.\n\nThis will create a new stereo mix of your video with the rear channels mixed at 50% volume.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue_description. The ffmpeg command it generated appears to be appropriately structured and should work correctly as per the user's requirements of downmixing 5.1 audio to stereo while adjusting the rear channels' volume.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure_example provided. The command it generated uses valid syntax and parameters consistent with the requirements for ffmpeg commands, specifically for audio filtering.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid options and parameters, correctly applies the audio filter to mix the rear channels at 50% volume, and maintains the structure that ffmpeg commands require.\n\n4) Given that the model's output adheres to the requirements of valid ffmpeg syntax, effectively addresses the user's request, and passes all outlined criteria, it should be evaluated as successful."
