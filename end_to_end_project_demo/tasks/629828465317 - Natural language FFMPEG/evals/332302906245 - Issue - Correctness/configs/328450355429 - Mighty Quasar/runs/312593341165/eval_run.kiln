  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order, you should combine the LNR (lightness noise reduction), yadif (yadif filter for reduced motion blur and noise reduction), and sharp filters. The recommended order is:\n\n- yadif for motion blur and initial noise reduction\n- lnr for temporal noise reduction\n- Sharp for final spatial detail enhancement\n\nThis order leverages the strengths of each filter:\n\n- yadif corrects motion blur and helps reduce initial noise before lnr kicks in for temporal reduction.\n- lnr suppresses temporal noise but can make motion blurred parts look smoother if the motion was too slow.\n- sharp enhances spatial edges and sharpens details without over-smoothing motion.\n\nHere is an example filter chain for ffmpeg, assuming your input is input.mp4 and output is output_denoise.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif,lnr,sharp\" -c:a copy output_denoise.mp4\n```\n\n- -vf inside takes the filters chain sequentially.\n- Output audio copy (-c:a copy) avoids re-encoding the audio.\n\nIf the input contains motion below a certain speed, yadif has a parameter speed_threshold to control when lnr kicks in for temporal noise reduction. For gentle motion or slow scenes, adjust it accordingly for more or less noise reduction, or manually switch lnr on/off (not recommended, but you can do so with expression).\n\nIf you want to experiment or customize, consider using expressions instead of hard filtering, but for a simple denoise command given, this approach is best.\n\nThis chain applies significant noise reduction and sharpness in one step, which is a common workflow for automatic video pre-processing before editing. Adjust the chain to fit your specific noise profiles.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command provided seems to be syntactically correct and follows the guidelines laid out in the FFmpeg manual. The filter chain \"yadif,lnr,sharp\" is also a valid configuration based on the capabilities of FFmpeg. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model correctly utilizes existing filters and parameters based on the FFmpeg capabilities.\n\n3) The command does not appear to break any of the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax used in the output (e.g., `-vf \"yadif,lnr,sharp\"` and `-c:a copy`) complies with the specifications for applying filters and maintaining the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and can be considered to have successfully completed the task without generating a command that would likely fail in execution. Thus, it passes the evaluation as it adheres to the requirements."
