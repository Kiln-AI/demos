  "input": "Can you set the bitrate to 100M for maximum quality when converting to MP4?",
  "output": "To convert to MP4 with a 100 Mbps bitrate for maximum quality, you'll use a very high constant bitrate instead of CRF (Constant Rate Factor). This will produce excellent quality but very large file sizes.\n\nI'm assuming you want to convert from some input file to MP4. Here's the command:\n\n- `-b:v 100M` sets video bitrate to 100 megabits per second\n- `-maxrate 100M` and `-bufsize 200M` ensure bitrate stays consistent and provide buffer for encoding\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 encoding\n- `-preset slow` prioritizes quality over encoding speed\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 320k` uses high-quality AAC audio at 320 kbps\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_file -c:v libx264 -b:v 100M -maxrate 100M -bufsize 200M -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 320k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: 100 Mbps is extremely high - most content doesn't benefit from bitrates above 10-20 Mbps. This will create very large files (about 750 MB per minute of video). Consider if this bitrate is truly necessary for your use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command adheres to the user's request to set the video bitrate to 100M for maximum quality. All parameters in the command appear to be correctly formatted and appropriate for achieving the objective of converting to MP4 with a specified bitrate. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example, as the command provided does not contain any mistakes. The provided `ffmpeg` command uses valid options which align with the parameters specified by the user and supports common codec standards. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All utilized parameters are consistent with the documentation, ensuring that the options are applied to the output file while the order is respected.\n\nIn summary, the modelâ€™s output successfully meets the requirements of the task without any errors in the command generated, and adheres to the specifications from the user. Therefore, it passes all evaluation criteria."
