  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain the stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformations (rotation and scaling) in FFmpeg, you’ll apply them sequentially using the `vf` (video filter) chain. Key assumptions:  \n- You’ve installed **libopencv** for stabilization (required for `vidstab` filters).  \n- Stabilization is performed via `vidstabdetect` (analysis) and `vidstabtransform` (application), which typically require two steps.  \n- Color grading uses the `lut` filter for customizable adjustments (e.g., brightness, contrast, saturation).  \n- Rotation and scaling are applied directly with `rotate` and `scale` filters.  \n\nHere’s the command:  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabdetect, vidstabtransform, lut=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2:saturation=1.5, rotate=10, scale=1280:720\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `vidstabdetect`: Analyzes the footage to detect shaky motion (generates a transform file, which must be manually saved or used in a modifier).  \n- `vidstabtransform`: Applies the stabilization using the detected transform.  \n- `lut`: Adjusts color grading parameters (example values for brightness, contrast, and saturation). Replace with desired settings.  \n- `rotate=10`: Rotates the video by 10 degrees (adjust the angle as needed).  \n- `scale=1280:720`: Resizes the video to 1280x720 resolution. Use `-1` for width or height to maintain aspect ratio.  \n\n**Note:** Stabilization often requires two passes (detect and transform), so ensure `vidstabdetect` outputs a transform file before using `vidstabtransform` in a separate command. Adjust parameters for geometric transformations based on your specific needs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be valid and follows the expected syntax for FFmpeg, properly chaining together multiple filters for stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced does not include any invalid parameters or options (like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist). The filters and parameters used in the command are appropriate for their intended functions.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command correctly specifies the input file and applies the video filters in a logical order, followed by defining the output file. Each of the filters (`vidstabdetect`, `vidstabtransform`, `lut`, `rotate`, and `scale`) is properly formatted and used in the context of video filter operations.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass as it successfully generates a valid FFmpeg command."
