  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 10 Mbps and audio bitrate to 1 Mbps (1000 kbps) for streaming, use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs for compatibility. The `yuv420p` pixel format ensures broad playback support, while `movflags +faststart` optimizes MP4 files for web streaming by moving metadata to the beginning.\n\n- `-b:v 10M` defines the video bitrate as 10 Mbps (10,000,000 bits per second).\n- `-b:a 1000k` defines the audio bitrate as 1 Mbps (1,000,000 bits per second).\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` ensure standard codecs for streaming.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` guarantees compatibility with most devices.\n- `-movflags +faststart` enables efficient streaming for MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10M -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file is in MP4 format (if not, replace `input.mp4` with the actual file name and container).  \n- The user is targeting MP4 as the output container for streaming compatibility.  \n- Audio bitrate of 1 Mbps is intentional, though it is unusually high for typical streaming use cases (common ranges: 128k–512k for AAC).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model’s output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated matches the user's requirement to set the video and audio bitrates correctly, utilizing supported codecs and formats.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid and does not reference any erroneous parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options specified (like `-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, `-pix_fmt`, and `-movflags`) are documented and used correctly according to the provided specification.\n\n4) The model’s output does not contain the issue described and thus passes the evaluation. The command appears to be correctly structured for the intended task with no mistakes present."
