  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert audio.ogg to WAV format explicitly using the Vorbis decoder, specify the -c:a vorbis for decoding and then output to a WAV container. To resample to 48kHz, include the -ar 48000 option. The WAV format will be uncompressed PCM by default, ensuring compatibility and quality.\n\nKey points:\n- -c:a vorbis uses the Vorbis decoder to decode OGG Vorbis audio.\n- -ar 48000 resamples the audio to 48kHz.\n- WAV will be the container, preserving uncompressed PCM audio.\n  \n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -c:a vorbis -ar 48000 output.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The command provided by the model incorrectly specifies the audio codec using `-c:a vorbis`, which is not appropriate for converting to WAV since WAV format typically uses PCM audio. The correct way to handle this conversion does not require specifying the codec for decoding the input but rather implies using PCM for the WAV output.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output because it does not use a non-existent preset or fail in syntax. However, it does contain a misunderstanding of how to properly use FFmpeg options relevant to the task.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page because it incorrectly uses the `-c:a vorbis` option, which is not applicable for encoding to WAV. The WAV format uses PCM as its audio codec, so the command needs to be adjusted to reflect that.\n\n4) Since the command contains incorrect parameters and fundamentally misunderstands how to perform the requested task, it should be marked as failing."
