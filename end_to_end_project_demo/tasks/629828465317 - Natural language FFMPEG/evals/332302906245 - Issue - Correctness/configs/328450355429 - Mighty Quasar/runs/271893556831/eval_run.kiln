  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mkv` as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate, use the LAME MP3 encoder (`libmp3lame`) and set the bitrate to 320 kbps (the highest standard for MP3). Maximum quality is achieved by combining the highest bitrate with the LAME quality scale. The command assumes the input video contains an audio stream and that ffmpeg is installed with MP3 encoding support.\n\n- `-vn` disables video processing (only audio is extracted).\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` sets the audio codec to MP3 using LAME.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (max standard MP3 quality).\n- `-q:a 0` uses the highest constant quality level for LAME (0 is best, 9 is worst).\n- `-ar` and `-ac` can be omitted if preserving the original audio sample rate and channels is acceptable (assumed here).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 audio.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue described in the issue description. The command generated is valid and meets the user's requirement of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as an MP3 file with max bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not use any invalid options or parameters, therefore it should execute correctly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options utilized are valid, and the order of applying options follows the guidelines presented in the man page.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It successfully generates a command that works correctly and meets the user's request. Therefore, it should pass."
