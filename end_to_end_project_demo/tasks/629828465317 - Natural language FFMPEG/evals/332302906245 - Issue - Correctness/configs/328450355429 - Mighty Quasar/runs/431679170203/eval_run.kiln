  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds, you can use the `-vf fps=1/2` filter which captures one frame every 2 seconds. For ultra high resolution, I assume your source video has a high resolution; ffmpeg extracts frames at the original quality by default, so no resizing filter is needed. The images will be saved as PNG (lossless) with filenames like `frame_0001.png`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nThis extracts one frame every 2 seconds (`fps=1/2`) and saves it as PNG images with zero-padded sequence numbers.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The command generated correctly extracts frames from the input video every 2 seconds and outputs the images in PNG format, matching the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given. The command generated by the model follows the correct syntax and parameters that are in accordance with the ffmpeg man page. There are no obvious syntax errors like the example failure output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the required format and uses the correct options to extract frames at the specified interval without any issues arising from the use of options.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the modelâ€™s output does not contain the issues described. Therefore, it should pass."
