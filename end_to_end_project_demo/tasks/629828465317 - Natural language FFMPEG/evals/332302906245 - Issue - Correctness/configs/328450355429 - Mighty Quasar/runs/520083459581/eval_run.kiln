  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To strip all audio while leaving the video untouched, we’ll use FFmpeg’s copy mode (`-c:v copy`) which passes the encoded video frames straight through without re-encoding.  \nThe `-an` option tells FFmpeg to drop every audio track.\n\nAssumption: you want a new file called video_only_no_audio.mp4; change the output name if you prefer something else.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an video_only_no_audio.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as the command generated correctly removes audio while preserving the video stream. The use of options `-c:v copy` and `-an` is valid and matches the user's requirement to strip audio without re-compressing the video.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output as the command generated is correct. The options used do not contain any invalid entries like `extra_fast` and do not violate any known ffmpeg syntax rules.\n\n3) The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an video_only_no_audio.mp4`) adheres to the syntax and requirements set out in the ffmpeg man page. It uses the input option `-i` correctly followed by output options specific to video stream copying and audio track removal.\n\n4) Since the command provided by the model is valid and meets the requirements of the task without errors or incorrect parameters, I conclude that the model performed well on this task."
