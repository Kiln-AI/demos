  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the original video stream while selecting only the third audio stream, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` parameter. This allows you to specify exactly which streams from the input should be included in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` maps the first video stream from input 0 (movie.mkv)\n- `-map 0:a:2` maps the third audio stream from input 0 (audio streams are 0-indexed, so index 2 = third stream)\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding (faster, no quality loss)\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding (assuming you want to keep the original audio codec)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf you want to re-encode the audio to a specific format (like AAC), replace `-c:a copy` with `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` or your preferred audio encoding settings.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command for `ffmpeg` generated by the model accurately reflects the user's request to keep the original video and map the third audio stream. The explanations provided also clarify what each parameter does, ensuring the command is correct and meets the user's needs.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in <failure_example>. The command produced is valid and correctly formatted, with appropriate parameters for the user's requirements.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The usage of `-map` for selecting specific streams, along with `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`, aligns with the options described in the man page. There are no errors or misapplications of options present.\n\n4) Since the model's output passes the evaluation criteria and does not contain the issue described, the conclusion is that it performs correctly on this task. It successfully provides a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the specifications of the userâ€™s requirement. Therefore, it should be marked as a pass."
