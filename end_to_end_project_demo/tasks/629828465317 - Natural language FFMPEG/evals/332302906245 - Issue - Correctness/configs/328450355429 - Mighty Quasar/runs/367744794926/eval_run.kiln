  "input": "Create a 'matrix' style video from `input.mp4` by changing the color so it's all green and black.",
  "output": "To create a 'matrix' style green and black video from `input.mp4`, you can apply a color matrix filter on `ffmpeg` using the `colormatrix` video filter. This filter allows you to remap pixel colors using matrix transformation. We'll remap green (0, 255, 0) to black (0, 0, 0) and all other colors to green (0, 255, 0). To achieve your desired effect, we need to map all colors to green intensively but without strictly to the green channel, as direct blacking-out in the YUV color space is quite complex and often involves taking the pixel's channel values and setting all non-green to zero.\n\nHere is a simplified approach: first, we extract the red and blue channels and set them to zero, which inadvertently turns red and blue colors to black. Then, we insert the green channel twice, implying a full green color saturation. With this basic transformation, we'll get a video where nearly everything will hopefully turn green while turning most black, accompanied by any red/blue components turning to black—though this won't perfectly mix to all green/black as described. Fine-grained matrix functionality to mute colors precisely would involve more advanced alternatives or post-processing, which are not directly supported by all versions of `ffmpeg`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"colormatrix=0,0,0,0,255,255,0,0,0,0,255,0,0,0,0,255,0,0\" matrix_output.mp4\n```\n\nIn this command:\n- The `colormatrix` filter is applied with custom values that map red/blue to zero and double the green, aiming to turn the image green while deactivating the red and blue colors.\n\nThis simplistic matrix attempt would give a visually similar effect to the 'matrix' look, but achieving precise black/green conversion may require additional steps or custom scripts. Keep in mind that actual results may vary, and there could be issues with very bright or saturated colors that don't get turned to pure black as expected.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model’s output does contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is likely incorrect because the `colormatrix` filter does not take the form the model used in its command. Instead, it should utilize a different approach to achieve a green and black effect.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain a non-existent preset like `extra_fast`, but it is incorrect in its application of the `colormatrix` filter parameters.\n\n3) The command breaks a requirement dictated in the man page because it incorrectly utilizes the `colormatrix` filter syntax. The parameters used in the colormatrix filter do not correspond to the proper usage as specified in the official FFmpeg documentation. The model assumed a creative and simplified approach was sufficient, which fails in execution.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output fails since it does contain the issue described: the command it generated likely does not work correctly for the user's requirement of a 'matrix' style video."
