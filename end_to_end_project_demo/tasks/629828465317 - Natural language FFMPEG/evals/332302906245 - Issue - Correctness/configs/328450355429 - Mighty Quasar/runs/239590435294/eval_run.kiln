  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you can use the following command:\n\n FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a lossless audio compression format, so the quality of the audio will be preserved. The `-c:a flac` option specifies the audio codec as FLAC, and the `-compression_level 12` option sets the compression level to maximum (12 is the highest level).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input file `video.mp4` contains at least one audio stream.\n* You want to extract the default audio stream (if there are multiple audio streams). If you want to extract a specific audio stream, you can use the `-map` option (e.g., `-map 0:a:1` to extract the second audio stream).\n\nNote: If you want to preserve the original audio metadata (e.g., tags, album art), you can add the `-map_metadata 0` option. However, this may not be supported by all FLAC encoders.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output from the model does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The generated command is valid and correctly formats the extraction of audio from video, specifying the FLAC codec and applying the maximum compression setting as intended. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command correctly specifies the audio codec as FLAC and utilizes the `-compression_level 12` option for maximum compression. In contrast, the failing output example provided contains a non-existent preset, whereas the output in question uses valid options.\n\n3) Referencing the FFmpeg man page, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements. The options used (`-c:a flac` and `-compression_level 12`) are valid and appropriate for the task of extracting audio to a FLAC file. \n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command works correctly, matches user requirements, and adheres to the documented options in the FFmpeg man page. This leads to assessing the performance as passing since the command is generated correctly based on the user's request."
