    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The output does not provide any valid `ffmpeg` command and appears to be gibberish or randomly generated characters, which does not meet the userâ€™s request to create a command that maps video stream 6 and audio stream 9.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given in the failure example. Instead, it produced an entirely incoherent output that doesn't resemble an `ffmpeg` command at all. However, it certainly fails in the context of providing a usable command for the user.\n\n3) The output does not break any requirements dictated in the man page, primarily because it does not produce a valid `ffmpeg` command to evaluate. However, per the user's request, mapping video stream 6 and audio stream 9 would typically require a command like `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 output.mp4`, which is something the model failed to generate.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output contains the issue described in the evaluation, as it does not generate a proper command that adheres to the user's requirements. Consequently, it should be marked as a failure."
