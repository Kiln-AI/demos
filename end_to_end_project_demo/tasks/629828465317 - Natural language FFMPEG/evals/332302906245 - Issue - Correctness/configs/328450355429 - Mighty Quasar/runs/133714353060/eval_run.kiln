  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically using FFmpeg, you can use the `vstack` filter, which assumes that the input videos have the same resolution and frame rates. Here's a command to create the stacked video.\n\n- `-i top_video.mp4` and `-i bottom_video.mp4` are the input files, which you want to stack.\n- The `-filter_complex` option is used for more complex video filters, like `vstack`.\n- `vstack` stacks the videos vertically.\n\nHowever, if the two input videos have different resolutions but the same width (which vertical concatenation requires for natural behavior), this command would still work. To automate that part, we'd need more information about the video characteristics. If your input videos have the same width but different heights (and potentially frame rate or resolution levels other than width), a top/bottom source width must be a common denominator to all frame widths - naturally that is directly providing frame facial pixels information (x resolution).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy stacked.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n\n* Both `top_video.mp4` and `bottom_video.mp4` have the same width and frame rates. If they don't, you would need to add additional processing steps to account for the differences.\n* Both `top_video.mp4` and `bottom_video.mp4` contain at least one audio stream. The `-c:a copy` option means that the audio from both inputs will be copied into the output. If the inputs contain multiple audio streams or have different audio properties, additional processing might be needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here: \nYes, the command generated will stack the two videos vertically as requested. However, the output doesn't explicitly check for resolution disparity and adjustments for differing heights, which might lead to potential issues if the top and bottom videos have different widths or the same width but differing heights. The explanation implies the command will work with the same width but does not ensure that they are scaled to match heights for vertical stacking.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output? \nNo, the command does not contain a completely invalid parameter. The command syntax appears correct and uses valid options. However, it also doesn't specify additional handling for input resolution differences, which could be a practical issue.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page? \nNo, the command generated does not break the requirements in the man page. It adheres to the proper syntax and uses correct parameters. The use of `-filter_complex vstack` is valid for stacking videos.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? \nThe model's output does pass since it generates a command that will functionally work under the assumed conditions (same width, frame rates). However, it should ideally address potential resolution differences more explicitly for robustness."
