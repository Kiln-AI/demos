  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply **temporal noise reduction**, **spatial denoising**, and **edge enhancement** in the specified order, use FFmpeg's filter chain syntax (`-vf`). These filters are executed left to right within quotation marks, ensuring the output of one becomes the input of the next. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **`noise=tr=[temporal_radius]:tn=[spatial_radius]`**:  \n   Reduces temporal noise (jitter between frames). Adjust `tr` (temporal radius) and `tn` (spatial radius) to control effect strength. A moderate setting like `tr=3:tn=2` balances noise reduction and detail preservation.\n\n2. **`nlmeans`**:  \n   A spatial denoiser that smooths noise within individual frames. The `s=[strength]` parameter (e.g., `s=4`) controls processing intensity. Higher values reduce more noise but may blur details.\n\n3. **`unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0`**:  \n   Sharpens edges. The first `5` is width blur radius, the second `5` is height blur radius. The `1.0`s set the strength of luminance and chrominance sharpening. Adjust as needed for your desired enhancement.\n\n---\n\nThe complete command, preserving original resolution:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"noise=tr=3:tn=2, nlmeans=s=4, unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0\" output.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- Input file is an MP4 video (`input.mp4`), output also saved as MP4 (`output.mp4`).\n- No explicit bitrate or codec changes needed; uses existing audio and video streams (ensure H.264 and AAC if browser compatibility is vital).\n- Default filter parameters (`tr=3`, `tn=2`, `s=4`, `1.0:1.0`) may be adjusted based on specific noise levels or artistic intent.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command correctly follows the syntax and uses valid filter parameters supported by FFmpeg for temporal noise reduction (`noise`), spatial denoising (`nlmeans`), and edge enhancement (`unsharp`).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of failing output. The command it generated does not include a non-existent preset or incorrect option; it is structured properly with valid parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The approach taken for the filters used matches the descriptions from the man page, and the options are applied properly.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue and appropriately fulfills the user's request. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
