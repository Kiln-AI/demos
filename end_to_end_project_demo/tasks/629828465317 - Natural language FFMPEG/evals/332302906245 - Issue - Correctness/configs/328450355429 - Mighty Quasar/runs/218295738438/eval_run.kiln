  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a Matroska file and save them as MP4, use the `-map` option to select the desired tracks. The streams are referenced with the format `file_index:stream_index` where both indices start at 0.\n\n- `-map 0:v:4` selects the 5th video stream (index 4) from the first input file (0)\n- `-map 0:a:9` selects the 10th audio stream (index 9) from the first input file (0)\n\nSince no re-encoding is specified, this will perform a stream copy (`-c copy`), which is lossless and very fast.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command it generated correctly selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file, and it uses the appropriate mapping options. The command is syntactically correct and meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command generated by the model does not contain any incorrect options or parameters; it correctly employs `-map` and `-c copy`, which are valid and properly utilized in this context.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of the `-map` option and `-c copy` to select and copy the desired video and audio streams is appropriate, and the syntax follows the conventions outlined in the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, the modelâ€™s output **does not** contain the issue described, and thus, it should pass this evaluation. The command is functional, follows the appropriate syntax, and fulfills the user's request accurately."
