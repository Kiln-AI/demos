  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction, use the following FFmpeg command:\n\nThe `tfps` filter adjusts input pixels into either clockwise or counter-clockwise order and also rotates input to desired frame. The ` -vf` option is used for video filters, and the `s=90` parameter rotates pixels 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nNoise reduction is applied with -vf advanced filters, specifically the 'nn' (Noise Reduction) filter for Gaussian, speckle and impulse noise reduction; the strongest combination 'nn=gauss:b=1:sz=3:lim=0.07' combines Gaussian blur and adaptive threshold, which is great at edge noise.\n\nHere are three effects are needed to address additive noise as they are added together, it makes sense:\n\n- 1. `nn=gauss:b=1:sz=3:lim=0.07` (Gaussian blur and impulse noise threshold)\n- 2.  `nn=tvdb3:b=5:sz=2:lim=0.09` (TV dB3 for the median and 5-tap block size for high noise; to help clean up non-impulsive noise)\n- 3.  `nn=diffu:b=20:sz=3:lev=b`, adds a detail estimation before noise reduction, as it will make all noise become impulse noise: so can undo all the reduction.\n\n**Effectively adding combination**\n\nThus the whole approach to noise reduction becomes\n\n`nn=gauss:b=1:sz=3:lim=0.07 + nn=tvdb3:b=5:sz=2:lim=0.09 + nn=diffu:b=20:sz=3:lev=b`\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf tfps=s=90,madx=b=3:lev=1 -filter_complex \"nn=gauss:b=1:sz=3:lim=0.07+nn=tvdb3:b=5:sz=2:lim=0.09+nn=diffu:b=20:sz=3:lev=b\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated is incorrect because it doesn't properly use the filter options and the way to combine filters is not valid in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failing output in that it includes an incorrect filter format. Specifically, the command uses a wrong approach for combining multiple noise reduction filters; it attempts to add them with a `+`, which is not a valid syntax in ffmpeg's filterchain without properly structuring the filter_complex option.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirements dictated in the man page. The filter combination is incorrectly formatted, leading to invalid syntax for the video filters.\n\nGiven these points, the output does not fulfill the requirements stated by the user, as it does not produce a valid ffmpeg command that works correctly to perform the specified transformations. Therefore, the evaluation would conclude that the model failed to provide a correct response."
