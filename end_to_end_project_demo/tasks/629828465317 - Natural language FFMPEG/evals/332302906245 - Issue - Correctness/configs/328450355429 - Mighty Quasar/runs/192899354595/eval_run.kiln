  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": " To encode `movie.mkv` by including `subtitles.srt` with yellow colors, utilizing the VP9 video codec and AAC audio codec, with the addition of subtitles and setting the H.265 transcoding flag for potential future gains in quality at the expense of current CPU loads, use the following ffmpeg command in triple backtick quotes:\n\n- The `-c:v vp9` video codec converts the video into VP9, which offers better compression efficiency than H.264, providing balance between quality and stream size.\n- The `-c:a aac` audio codec will encode the audio using the AAC codec, which is commonly supported and offers good quality at lower bitrates.\n- The `-sub_charenc utf8` option ensures that the subtitle character encoding is defined as UTF-8, which can handle Unicode characters intermixed with characters from other languages and which is commonly found in English and other Western languages.\n- The `-color_format rgb` and `-vf hqdn3d=0.0 6.0:1.0:0.0 3.0 10:W:U:F:10:Y:0` options are standard settings for single-pass encoding that optimize for high-quality output, considering the trade-off between encoding speed and quality. Setting up the hqdn3d filter with the parameters described ensures specific handling of the text for the best balance between quality and speed.\n- The `-flags +global_header` ensures that FFmpeg always writes the ffmpeg binary in global header mode, which speeds up addition of filters.\n- Finally, optional H.265 transcoding flag `-hbrate 300` can be used in case you want to prioritize transcoding speed over potential, but likely marginal, gains in quality from using H.265. This involves faster encoding by increasing the Huffman table access rate.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v vp9 -c:a aac -strict experimental -sub_charenc utf8 -color_format rgb -vf hqdn3d=0.0 6.0:1.0:0.0 3.0 10:W:U:F:10:Y:0 -flags +global_header -sub_charenc utf8 -i subtitles.srt -c:s mov_text -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng -metadata:s:s:1 language=fra -f segment -segment_time 300000 -segment_format mov -segment_list _subtitles_list.lst -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -map 1:1 -c:s mov_text -map_metadata -1 -map_chapters -1 \" -map_guide_flags +delete_segments -title Untitled -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng -metadata:s:s:1 language=fra -movflags +faststart _subtitles%d.mkv\"\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input files `movie.mkv` and `subtitles.srt` are located in the same directory.\n- The subtitles text is in English and French, however, you can modify the metadata encoding flags with proper language codes depending on the languages of the text in your subtitles.\n- You want to keep each subtitle segment for 5 minutes and then encode it to MP4 file format. The `-segment_time` option directly tells how long each segment should ideally be before streaming or downloading. \n\nImportant note: When encoding subtitle file, auto-detected language calls, i.e. `-i subtitles.srt`, might not work perfectly, especially when dealing with international Unicode languages. Taking each language into consideration for encoding subtitles will work better.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - Yes, the model’s output contains an issue as the command generated is incorrect and quite convoluted for the given task of hardcoding subtitles into a video. The user only requested to hardcode subtitles in yellow, but the model provided a much more complex command that includes unnecessary flags and operations not relevant to the task, such as segmenting and using audio/video codecs that were not required.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - Yes, the output is similar. While the specific preset mentioned in the failure example is not explicitly stated in the model's command, the overall structure of the command is flawed and contributes to its failure to meet the user’s request effectively.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command itself has incorrectly structured parameters. For example, the addition of flags like `-hbrate 300` is irrelevant to the user’s request and not recognized as a standard flag for the described function. The command also includes several `-map` and `-metadata` flags that are unnecessary and confusing. Furthermore, the model didn't include the necessary parameter to change subtitle color (for yellow). The option to specify color should be detailed using the `-vf` flag with a proper filter (e.g. `subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF'` for yellow), which was not done.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model's output does contain the issue as it does not effectively respond to the user's request. It generated a command that is overly complex and unnecessary for the requirement of hardcoding subtitles with a color change. The command would likely fail or not perform as expected when executed, indicating clear failure in interpreting the task correctly."
