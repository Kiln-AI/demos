  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "To achieve maximum compatibility across devices, we'll utilize both libx264 and libx265 video codecs. This ensures that the video can be played on a wider range of devices, some of which might have better support for one codec over the other. We'll also set a reasonable CRF value for quality and a bitrate for the x265 stream.\n\n- `libx264`:  A widely supported H.264 codec.\n- `libx265`: A more modern, efficient H.265 (HEVC) codec.\n- `-c:v libx264`:  Specifies libx264 for the first video stream.\n- `-c:v libx265`: Specifies libx265 for the second video stream.\n- `-crf 23`: Sets the Constant Rate Factor for quality. A lower CRF value results in higher quality.\n- `-b:v 2M`: Sets the target bitrate for the x265 video stream (2 Mbps). Adjust this value based on your desired quality and file size.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:v libx265 -b:v 2M output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated does not work as it incorrectly specifies two video codecs (`libx264` and `libx265`) simultaneously for the same output stream by using two `-c:v` options. In FFmpeg, you cannot specify multiple codecs for a single video stream; instead, you would typically create separate streams for each codec if encoding to a single output file. \n\n2) The model's output is similar to the example of a failing output because it misuses the `-c:v` option by specifying it twice but inappropriately for the same output. This would lead to an invalid command syntax and would fail when executed.\n\n3) The command does break the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg because each option, like `-c:v`, should only be applied once for the output stream it is intended for. Having two `-c:v` options specified for the same output will cause confusion and an error. \n\nOverall, the command generated by the model is incorrect and does not fulfill the userâ€™s request. Hence, it fails to pass the evaluation."
