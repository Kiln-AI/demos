  "input": "I want to convert my video.avi to MOV format using the nvenc_h265 encoder with ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert `video.avi` to MOV format using NVIDIA's H.265 encoder (`nvenc_h265`) with the \"ultrafast\" preset, you'll specify the encoder and preset, copy the audio stream for efficiency, and ensure the output container is set to MOV. The \"ultrafast\" preset prioritizes speed over compression efficiency, which is ideal for quick encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v h265_nvenc -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your system has NVIDIA GPU acceleration enabled and the `h265_nvenc` encoder is available (requires NVIDIA GPU and appropriate FFmpeg build).  \n- The audio stream in `video.avi` is compatible with MOV format (e.g., AAC, MP3, or other widely supported codecs). If not, you may need to re-encode the audio.  \n- No specific audio codec or bitrate adjustments are required, so the original audio is preserved.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command is correct and adheres to the user's request for converting `video.avi` to MOV format using the `nvenc_h265` encoder with the `ultrafast` preset. The command is structured properly and uses valid options.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided. The example command in the failure example uses a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`), while the model correctly uses the existing `ultrafast` preset in the provided output.\n\n3) The command generated in the model's output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It appropriately specifies the input file, output format, video codec, and audio handling, all of which are supported by ffmpeg.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output **passes**. It correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command reflective of the user's request without any issues."
