  "input": "I need to add a watermark image to my video and position it in the top-right corner with maximum transparency.",
  "output": "To overlay a watermark image onto a video in the top-right corner with maximum transparency, you can use `-i` to specify both input files and the `overlay` filter with x and y coordinates to place the watermark. To achieve maximum transparency, you should ensure the watermark image has transparency (alpha channel); then, use `format=auto,scale` to handle transparency correctly.\n\n- The `-i video.mp4` is your main video.\n- The `-i watermark.png` is your watermark image (preferably with an alpha channel for transparency).\n- `overlay` positions the watermark in the top right: x = main_width - watermark_width - margin, y = margin.\n- Use `-filter_complex` with `overlay` and `format=auto` to preserve transparency.\n\nAssuming you want the watermark in the top-right with a small margin (say, 10 pixels):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex \"[1][0]scale2ref=w='min(iw,main_w/5)':h='min(ih,main_h/5)':force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease[wm][vid];[vid][wm]overlay=W-w-10:10\" -c:a copy output_with_watermark.mp4\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- Adjust the scale as needed; above scales watermark to at most 20% of the main video.\n- `W-w-10` places it 10 pixels from the right edge, `10` from the top.\n- This preserves transparency if your watermark PNG has an alpha channel.\n- The `-c:a copy` copies the original audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nIf your watermark is already appropriately scaled and you don't want to scale, and it has transparency, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v]overlay=W-w-10:10\" -c:a copy output_with_watermark.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid and should work correctly for the task of adding a watermark image to a video with maximum transparency. The description of parameters and the command structure align well with FFmpeg's functionality, and there are no apparent mistakes in the command.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failing output example. The command provided is consistent with FFmpeg's syntax, and there are no illegal options or parameters present that would lead to a failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax used and the options provided are in accordance with the documentation. The `-filter_complex` and `overlay` filters are appropriate for composite operations, and the placement of options follows the rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the above reasoning, the model's output does not contain the issues described, and the command is valid according to FFmpeg's requirements. Therefore, the evaluation should be a pass."
