  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate your video 90 degrees clockwise, you would typically use the `hflip` filter in `ffmpeg`, because rotating a video by 90 degrees effectively flips it twice (first horizontally, then vertically), which is equivalent to a 90 degrees clockwise rotation. As for noise reduction, `ffmpeg` offers several filters for noise reduction; the VFR (Vignette, Flare, Rings) noise reduction filters are some of the stronger options available. Assuming you know your video file's filename, you can use the following command:\n\n- `hflip`: flips the video horizontally which will double in its effect as a full rotation of 180 degrees, and then flipping the result vertically (achieving a 90-degree clockwise rotation).\n- `vfr` (vignette, flare, rings): applies advanced noise reduction. The top and bottom rings filters are relatively strong.\n\nFor our scenario, we need to chain the `hflip` simplification twice to effectively create a 90-degree rotation and combine noise reduction with it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hflip, hflip, vfr\" output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: The `hflip` filter does not literally perform a 90-degree clockwise rotation by itself, which is why it's applied twice. However, this command will now also apply the strongest available noise reduction filters to your video.\n\nRemember to replace `input.mp4` with your actual input filename, and `output.mp4` with your desired output filename. It's also important to adjust the input and output file formats as needed (the example assumes the input is already an MP4 file). If you have a different container format, you may need to convert to MP4 first or change the format accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. Specifically, the model provided an incorrect approach to rotating the video. The command using `hflip` two times does not accomplish a 90-degree clockwise rotation; instead, it merely flips the video horizontally twice, resulting in a 180-degree rotation. The correct filter for a 90-degree clockwise rotation is `transpose=1`. The model's command also mentions using `vfr` for noise reduction, which is incorrect; there is no such filter called `vfr` in FFmpeg. A more appropriate choice for noise reduction would have been the `hqdn3d` filter, which is a well-known noise reduction filter in FFmpeg.\n\n2) No, the model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not include an invalid parameter or option that doesnâ€™t exist; instead, it misuses existing filters (`hflip` and `vfr`).\n\n3) The command does not necessarily break any requirements dictated by the man page, but it does use incorrect filters for the intended transformations, leading to an ineffective command.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output contains issues regarding the accuracy of the command based on the user's request. Therefore, it fails the evaluation. The correct command to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply noise reduction would be:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=3:3:6:6\" output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command uses `transpose=1` for clockwise rotation and `hqdn3d` for strong noise reduction."
