  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo extract audio from `video.mp4` and save it as FLAC with experimental support and noise reduction, you first extract the audio stream, then pass it through a noise reduction filter. Here, we'll assume you have a reference for the noise profile; but for simplicity, for basic noise reduction without reference input, we can use a default noise filter like `anoiser` or `afftdn`. Below is an example using `afftdn` to reduce noise, and then save to FLAC.\n\nThe `afftdn` (Audio Fast Fourier Transform Denoise) filter is available in more recent versions of FFmpeg and provides noise reduction. For historical reasons, it's often labeled as experimental - so its use requires the `-strict -2` flag if needed.\n\nHere is a command to extract the audio, apply noise reduction, and save to FLAC:\n\n- `-vn` disables video to extract audio only.\n- `-af afftdn=nr=10:nc=2` applies noise reduction (parameters may need tuning for your source).\n- `-c:a flac` uses the FLAC encoder (which is usually included in standard FFmpeg).\n- `-movflags +faststart` is for compatibility; not necessary for audio-only files, but can be removed safely here if you want.\n- `-c:a flac` ensures FLAC output, which is lossless and suitable for archival quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af afftdn=nr=10:nc=2 -c:a flac -y output.flac\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- You want good archival quality, hence FLAC.\n- The input `.mp4` contains a single audio stream.\n- The noise reduction amount (nr=10) may vary depending on your source. Adjust as needed.\n\n**If you want to reference a noise profile**, you'd capture some noise-only reference audio and input that, but the basic case here covers standalone noise reduction.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output appears to accurately generate a valid `ffmpeg` command for extracting audio from a video file and applying noise reduction while saving the audio in FLAC format. The command uses commonly accepted parameters and functionality of `ffmpeg`, particularly for audio extraction and processing. As such, it does not contain the issue described in the prompt, and thus passes this evaluation.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any incorrect parameters or options like `-preset extra_fast`, which is a non-existent preset. The model's command is logical and contains valid options for the task it was supposed to accomplish.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command generated by the model does adhere to the requirements stated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It properly specifies input and output files, includes options that are relevant and applicable to the command's intended function, and follows the correct sequence of parameters. Furthermore, the use of `-vn` to disable video and the filters applied via `-af` are appropriate for the task of extracting and processing audio only.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it should pass the evaluation. The command is well-constructed, does not feature non-existent options, and complies with the functionality expected from `ffmpeg`, ensuring it will function correctly."
