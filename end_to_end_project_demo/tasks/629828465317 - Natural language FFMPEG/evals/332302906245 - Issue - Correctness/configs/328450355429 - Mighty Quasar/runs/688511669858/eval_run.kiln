  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a watermark to the bottom left corner of your video and make it semi-transparent, use the overlay filter in ffmpeg with the alpha channel of the watermark (logo.png). For best practices, ensure logo.png is a true PNG with transparency.\n\nHere are the parameters used:\n- overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10 places the watermark 10 pixels from the bottom and left.\n- w, h are ffmpeg variables for the watermark's width and height; W, H are for the main video.\n- Avoid hardcoding offsets for flexibility.\n- Transparency (alpha blending) is handled by the PNG's transparency.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 -c:a copy output_watermarked.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- logo.png has an alpha channel (transparency) for the watermark effect.\n- The watermark should touch 10px from both the left and bottom edges.\n- The output format is MP4 with H.264 video and original audio untouched. Adjust as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command appears to be correctly formatted for applying a watermark with the overlay filter, which meets the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The example shows a command with a non-existent preset; in contrast, the command produced by the model uses valid syntax and parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The syntax follows the documented rules regarding option order and usage.\n\n4) Given this assessment, the model's output should pass as it meets the user's request appropriately, uses valid commands, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page."
