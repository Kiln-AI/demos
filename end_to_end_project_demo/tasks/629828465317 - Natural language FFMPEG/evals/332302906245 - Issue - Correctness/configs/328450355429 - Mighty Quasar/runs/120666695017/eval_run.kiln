  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 format with the fastest encoding setting (using the libx264 \"rocket\" preset), use the following command:\n\n- -preset ultrafast chooses the fastest preset (equivalent to \"rocket\").\n- -crf 30 is a high compression, low quality suitable for very fast encoding and minimal file size (you can adjust this number).\n- -c:v libx264 encodes the video with the H.264 codec (required for MP4 compliance).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k uses AAC audio encoding at 128 kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes the MP4 for web streaming.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures maximum compatibility with players/devices.\n\nAssumption: \"Rocket\" preset is equivalent to ultrafast in ffmpeg (which delivers the fastest possible encoding speed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 30 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will transcode video.webm to an MP4 file as quickly as possible while aiming for reasonable playback compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. The command produced is technically valid; however, there is a mismatch with the userâ€™s explicit request for the \"rocket\" preset, which does not directly exist in FFmpeg. Instead, the correct equivalent is `-preset ultrafast`. While the command will function correctly since `ultrafast` is a valid preset, labeling it as equivalent to \"rocket\" might mislead users who expect \"rocket\" to be a direct option.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command produced by the model is a valid ffmpeg command, and all specified options exist in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It utilizes valid options compatible with FFmpeg's expected usage and syntax.\n\n4) As per the evaluation criteria, the model's output should fail because it incorrectly addresses the user input regarding the \"rocket\" preset. It leads to potential confusion, as \"rocket\" does not exist as a recognized option in FFmpeg. The assumption made by the model that \"rocket\" and \"ultrafast\" are interchangeable is incorrect without clear context."
