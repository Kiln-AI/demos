  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to apply three filters in a specific order: temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement. Let me recall how FFmpeg handles filter chains.\n\nFirst, I know that in FFmpeg, filters are applied in the order they are listed. So the first filter in the command is the first one applied. The user mentioned temporal noise reduction first. The tempnoisered filter is used for that. Then spatial denoising, which is done with the denoise filter. Finally, edge enhancement, which can be achieved with the unsharp filter.\n\nI need to make sure the syntax is correct. Each filter is specified with its parameters. For tempnoisered, the parameters are typically the strength for temporal and spatial noise. The denoise filter has parameters for spatial noise reduction. Unsharp is used for edge enhancement with parameters like sigma and amount.\n\nI should structure the filter chain as a single string inside the vf option. The filters are separated by commas. So the command would include a -vf option with the filters in order. Also, the user didn't specify input or output files, so I'll use placeholders like input.mp4 and output.mp4. \n\nI need to mention the parameters for each filter. Tempnoisered's parameters might be set to 0.2 and 0.5 for example. Denoise could be set with a threshold. Unsharp parameters like 0.1 for sigma and 1.5 for amount. Also, note that the order is important: temporal first, then spatial, then edge enhancement.\n\nWait, does the order matter for these filters? Temporal noise reduction would handle noise over time, then spatial denoising would clean up any remaining noise in the frame, and then enhancing edges. That makes sense. So the syntax should be correct as per the order given.\n\nI should also mention that the parameters might need adjustment based on the specific video content. The user might need to tweak the values for optimal results. Also, note that the filters are applied in the sequence specified, so the user must ensure the order is correct as per their needs.\n\nPutting it all together, the command would use the -vf option with the filter chain, and the explanation should detail each filter's role and parameters.\n</think>\n\nTo apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in sequence, use FFmpeg's filter chain syntax. Filters are applied in the order specified, with parameters tuned for each step:\n\n- **`tempnoisered`** (temporal noise reduction): Reduces noise across frames using a strength parameter for temporal and spatial noise.\n- **`denoise`** (spatial denoising): Further cleans the frame with a threshold parameter to control sensitivity.\n- **`unsharp`** (edge enhancement): Sharpens edges using sigma (blur radius) and amount (enhancement strength).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tempnoisered=0.2:0.5,denoise=threshold=0.4,unsharp=0.1:1.5:1.5\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Key assumptions**:\n- Input is a video file (e.g., `input.mp4`).\n- Parameters (`0.2`, `0.5`, etc.) are examples; adjust based on your content.\n- Filters are applied in the order: temporal → spatial → edge enhancement.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the criteria provided:\n\n1) **Presence of Issues Described**: The model's output does not appear to contain any major issues in the command it generates. The command correctly follows FFmpeg's syntax and applies the filters in the specified order while using plausible parameters. Thus, it adheres to the outlined task without any observable problems.\n\n2) **Similarity to the Provided Failure Example**: The command generated by the model is specific and utilizes existing filters with correct syntax. It does not resemble the failure example, which was problematic due to an invalid preset name. The filters (`tempnoisered`, `denoise`, and `unsharp`) used in the command are valid and their parameters are reasonable (assuming the default parameters are functional for typical use cases). Therefore, this output is not similar to the provided example of a failing command.\n\n3) **Compliance with the FFmpeg Man Page**: The command adheres to the requirements and format dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The input file is specified with `-i input.mp4`, the filters are applied correctly with the `-vf` option, and an output file is specified without violating any structured syntax or operational rules. Additionally, all filters and parameters applicable to the context appear to be valid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Overall Assessment**: Given that there are no significant errors in syntax or logic in the command generated, and it follows the FFmpeg guidelines, the command should work correctly based on the explanation provided.\n\n**Conclusion**: The model's output does not contain the issues described, does not resemble the failure example, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. Therefore, the model's performance on this task can be considered successful."
