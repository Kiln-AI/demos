  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you should:\n\n- Use the -vn flag to ignore/exclude video streams.\n- -acodec flac selects the FLAC audio codec.\n- -compression_level 12 applies FLACâ€™s maximum compression (FLAC supports values from 0 [fastest, least compression] to 12 [slowest, most compression]).\n\nHere's the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```\n\nThis will extract the audio track(s) from video.mp4, encode them as FLAC with the highest compression setting, and save to output.flac.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description because the produced command is logically sound and matches the requirements from the user's request. The command correctly utilizes the necessary parameters for extracting audio from a video file and encoding it as a FLAC file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided, as there is no syntax error or use of an invalid option like `-preset extra_fast` which does not exist. The command produced by the model is valid and functional according to FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) Referring to the FFmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements as all options used are legitimate for the task described. The options `-vn`, `-acodec flac`, and `-compression_level 12` are valid and appropriate for extracting audio as a FLAC file:\n\n- `-vn`: Disables video and is correctly utilized.\n- `-acodec flac`: Specifies the use of the FLAC audio codec, which is valid.\n- `-compression_level 12`: Applies the maximum compression for FLAC files, which is also a valid use.\n\nTherefore, the command works correctly according to the FFmpeg man page.\n\nOverall, I conclude that the model's output is correct, appropriate, and aligns with the requirements established by the user."
