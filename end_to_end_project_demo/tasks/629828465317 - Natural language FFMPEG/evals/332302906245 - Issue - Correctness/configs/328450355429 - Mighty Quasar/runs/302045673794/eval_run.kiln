  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate your video 90 degrees clockwise and apply strong noise reduction:\n\n- Use the `transpose=1` video filter to rotate 90° clockwise.\n- For advanced noise reduction, combine the `hqdn3d` (high quality 3D denoise) and `atadenoise` filters, both at aggressive strengths:\n  - `hqdn3d=16:24:16:24` applies strong spatial (`16`) and temporal (`24`) denoising (higher values = stronger effect).\n  - `atadenoise=0.08:0.08:0.6:0.06` uses strong settings for spatial and temporal denoising (near upper end of safe values).\n- Chain filters in the order: noise reduction first, then rotation (so you denoise original orientation).\n\nAssuming your input file is `input.mp4`, output will be `output_denoised_rotated.mp4` encoded with H.264 for wide compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d=16:24:16:24,atadenoise=0.08:0.08:0.6:0.06,transpose=1\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -c:a copy output_denoised_rotated.mp4\n```\n\n- `crf 18` ensures visually lossless quality.\n- `-c:a copy` keeps the original audio.\n- Adjust filter strengths if you see excessive smoothing.\n\nIf your input format isn't MP4, adjust filenames accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly uses `ffmpeg` syntax and parameters to achieve the user’s request of rotating the video and applying noise reduction filters. Upon inspection, the command appears to follow the requirements and is logically sound given the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model does not include any invalid parameters or options that would suggest it would result in failure. All options and parameters used in the command are valid and correspond to the requested operations.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. All options and filters used (`-vf`, `transpose=1`, `hqdn3d`, `atadenoise`, `-c:v`, `-crf`, `-preset`, `-c:a`) are legitimate options listed in the documentation, and the command structure adheres to the syntax rules specified.\n\n4) Since the output accurately fulfills the user's request, follows valid syntax, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` documentation, we conclude that the model's output does not contain the issue described and therefore it should pass the evaluation."
