  "input": "I need to convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert a video file using the VP8 codec in WebM format with the \"realtime\" preset and constant bitrate (CBR) mode, the following approach is recommended:\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` replaces `libvpx` (VP8) with `libvpx-vp9`, which enables VP9 encoding (the modern VP8/VP9 hybrid variant), but since you specifically asked for VP8, `libvpx` (orig VP8) is recommended.\n- For VP8 (`libvpx`), constant bitrate mode is controlled by `-b:v` (video bitrate). For CBR mode, set this parameter based on your desired bitrate.\n- `-q:v` sets constant quality mode (default is 0-63; higher == better quality). Since you specified bitrate CBR, we will not use `-q:v`. Instead, only set `-b:v` to your desired bitrate.\n- `-realtime` is not a specific constant for libvpx in ffmpeg; to optimize encoding speed at the cost of increased quality, use a faster preset like `-cpu-used 4` instead.\n- `-deadline good` and `-cpu-used 0` are default settings that can be omitted or adjusted.\n- Audio is copied or re-encoded as WebM usually supports Opus audio with VP8, but it depends on your input format.\n- Example assumes desired VP8 quality/bitrate is 1M bitrate for a progressive image file compatibility (if not compatible, adjust accordingly).\n\nHere, I assume you want a 2M CBR bitrate for VP8 encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -b:v 2M -c:a libopus -b:a 128k -deadline good -cpu-used 0 -err_detect ignore_err -pix_fmt yuv420p output.webm\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libvpx`: Use VP8 codec.\n- `-b:v 2M`: Set video bitrate to 2Mbps (CBR).\n- `-c:a libopus -b:a 128k`: Encode the audio stream to Opus audio at 128kbps.\n- `-deadline good -cpu-used 0`: Balance encoding speed and quality (equivalent to VP8's slower preset).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures output is compatible with most browsers and players.\n\nMake sure to adjust the bitrate as needed. This command assumes the input is `video.avi` for the VP8 video stream, and audio is re-encoded to Opus (a standard for WebM). If your source contains a built-in audio codec compatible with WebM, the audio codec call can be omitted.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the command generated by the model does contain issues. The specified codec for the output should be `libvpx` since the user explicitly requested to use the VP8 codec, but the model incorrectly referred to `libvpx-vp9`, which is for the VP9 codec. This discrepancy means that the command generated may not work as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   Yes, the output closely resembles a failing output because it includes an incorrect codec (`libvpx-vp9` instead of the required `libvpx` for VP8), which would likely lead to the command failing if executed.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   Yes, the command breaks the requirements as specified in the man page. The codec option should correctly reference `libvpx` for VP8, not `libvpx-vp9`. The user explicitly asked for a VP8 codec, so using `libvpx-vp9` violates that requirement.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n   The output fails because it does contain the issue of using the incorrect codec representation, which does not fulfill the user's request. Therefore, it should be marked as a failure."
