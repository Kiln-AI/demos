  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a source file, use the `-map` option to select stream indices. Stream indices are zero-based, so the third video stream is `0:v:2` and the second audio stream is `0:a:1`. This command extracts these streams and transfers them into a new MP4 container.\n\nAssumption: Your source file has at least three video streams and two audio streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command appropriately maps the third video stream and the second audio stream from the input file to the output file as specified by the user. The command utilizes the `-map` option correctly and includes the necessary options to accomplish the specified task, indicating that it matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4`) does not contain any mistakes regarding the parameters or syntax. It properly references the specific video and audio streams, and uses the `-c copy` parameter, indicating that it is merely copying the streams without re-encoding, which is valid and commonly used when no transcoding is needed.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` option is applied correctly with the zero-based indexing of streams, and it appropriately describes that three video streams and two audio streams are assumed to exist in the source file. The command follows the general rules laid out in the man page, including the proper order and syntax.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described and is correct for the user's request. Therefore, it should be considered to have passed the evaluation."
