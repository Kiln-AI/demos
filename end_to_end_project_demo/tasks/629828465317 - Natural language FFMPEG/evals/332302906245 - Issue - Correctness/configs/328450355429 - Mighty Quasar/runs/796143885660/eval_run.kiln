  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "In FFmpeg video filters, filters in the filter chain are applied in the order listed. The command you specified uses yadif for deinterlacing, then scale to 1920x1080, and unsharp to sharpen the scaled output. This is a common workflow for achieving progressive HD video with enhanced clarity.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file is interlaced; yadif (mode=1) provides more robust deinterlacing than default yadif.\n- You want to keep the full 1920x1080 HD frame, so the scale filter is set to 1920:1080.\n- luma_msize=5:5 in unsharp means a 5x5 sharpening kernel, and luma_amount=1.0 gives moderate sharpening on luminance.\n\nApplying the filters in the order you listed:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_interlaced.mkv -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' -c:a copy output_hd_sharpened.mkv\n```\n\n- `-vf 'yafdf=...,scale=...,unsharp=...'` chains the filters.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream as-is.\n- Replace `input_interlaced.mkv` with your file name and `output_hd_sharpened.mkv` with your desired output.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is appropriate and follows the user's request for applying the specified filters (deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening) in the order required. The command syntax is correct, and there is no indication of a functional mistake regarding the filters or their parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output (the failure example). The command given does not contain any nonexistent options or parameters that would cause it to fail. All filters and options employed are valid and conform to what is expected of the `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n3) After reviewing the provided man page for `ffmpeg`, the command does not break any requirements. All specified filters (`yadif`, `scale`, `unsharp`) and their parameters are valid according to the `ffmpeg` documentation. The input and output file handling, as well as the logical application of the video filters, adheres to the described syntax and practices outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output passes the evaluation criteria. The command is correct, well-structured, and effectively fulfills the user's request without errors or discrepancies."
