  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress your video.mov file using FFmpeg with the \"ultrafast\" preset (which is the fastest preset available, often referred to as a \"hyper\" or extremely fast preset), you can use the libx264 codec and specify '-preset ultrafast'. This reduces encoding time significantly at the expense of compression efficiency.\n\nHere is the command assuming you want to keep the same video format (using H.264 inside an MP4 container for compatibility):\n\n```\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264`: Use the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset ultrafast`: Use the fastest compression preset.\n- `-crf 23`: Constant Rate Factor for quality (23 is default, lower is better quality).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copy audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Output is `output.mp4` for wide compatibility. \n\nIf you must output to MOV container or want a specific goal, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided evaluation. The generated `ffmpeg` command is correct and correctly employs parameters and options based on the user's request for extremely fast processing using the \"ultrafast\" preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The suggested command uses a valid preset (`ultrafast`), while the failure example incorrectly uses a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`). Therefore, the modelâ€™s output is appropriate and does not match the failure example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options are logically structured, with appropriate parameters applied to the input and output files. Additionally, the selected codecs and parameters are valid per the specifications.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
