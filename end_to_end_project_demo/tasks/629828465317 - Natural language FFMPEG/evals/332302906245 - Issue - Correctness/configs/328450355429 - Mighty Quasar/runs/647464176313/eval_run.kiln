  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from a file with multiple tracks, you can use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. The `-map` option is used to specify which input streams to use for each output stream.\n\nAssuming your audio stream is a format that is compatible with the MP4 container (like AAC), here's how to do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map 0:v:15` selects the 16th video stream (since ffmpeg is 0-indexed) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:22` selects the 23rd audio stream from the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding for the output video (since H.264 is a widely-supported codec).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding (this preserves the audio quality but the output container must support the original audio codec). \n\nReplace `libx264` and/or `-c:a copy` if you want to use other video/audio codecs or encoding parameters.\n\nPlease be aware that if your input file contains subtitles or other stream types (like data streams), they might not be included in the output file. If you want to include them as well, you will have to use additional `-map` options for each stream type. However, not all containers support all possible combinations of stream types. The MKV container, for example, can handle almost anything, while the MP4 container is more limited in what it can contain.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output provided by the model does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command accurately selects the specified video and audio streams using the `-map` option, which fulfills the user's request without discrepancies or syntax errors. It uses parameters that are standard and valid according to the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided failure example. In the failure example, the command uses a non-existent preset, which would cause it to fail. The command generated by the model correctly identifies existing streams (15 for video and 22 for audio) and uses appropriate codecs.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It follows the correct syntax for input mapping and codec selection, and none of the options violate the constraints set forth by the documentation.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and it adheres to the requirements of the `ffmpeg` man page. Thus, it successfully passes the evaluation criteria."
