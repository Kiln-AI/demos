  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the third audio stream (index 2) and the first video stream (index 0) from `movie.mkv` and save them as `final.mp4`, use the `-map` option to specify the desired streams. Since MP4 files typically use H.264 for video and AAC for audio, we explicitly set these codecs to ensure compatibility and proper formatting.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0`: Selects the first video stream (index 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:2`: Selects the third audio stream (index 2) from the input file.\n- `-c:v h264`: Encodes video using H.264 (standard for MP4).\n- `-c:a aac`: Encodes audio using AAC (standard for MP4 and widely supported).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v h264 -c:a aac final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Based on the provided evaluation steps, here's the analysis of the model's performance:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The output does not contain any issues related to mistakes or errors in the generated ffmpeg command. The command accurately reflects the user's request to extract the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file, and it appropriately employs the `-map` option to select the correct streams.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v h264 -c:a aac final.mp4`) is both appropriate and executable. It does not include a nonexistent preset or any parameter that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` correctly identifies the streams to extract, and the specified codecs (H.264 for video and AAC for audio) are compatible with MP4 format. The order of the options is also respected, as the input file is specified before the output.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does not contain the issue described. It successfully meets the user's needs without errors or incorrect parameters.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is correct and does not present any issues. It receives a passing evaluation."
