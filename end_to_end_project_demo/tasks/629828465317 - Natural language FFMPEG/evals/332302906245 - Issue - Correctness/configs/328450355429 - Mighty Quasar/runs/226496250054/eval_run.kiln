  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from your video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution, you can use ffmpeg with the -vf scale filter paired with the -r parameter for frame rate control.\n\nKey points:\n- -vf \"scale=uhw:uhw\" will scale the output video/audio dimensions to the ultra high width (uhw) and ultra high height (uhw), preserving the aspect ratio. Replace uhw with your desired resolution in pixels, or use -2 (even number) to be divisible by 2 and preserve the default pixel format (yuv420p).\n- -vsync 1 ensures exactly one frame is extracted every 2 seconds.\n- -q:v 2 sets the highest (best) quality for PNG images.\n- We omit audio by default with -an to keep the output clean.\n\nExample assumes you want to extract up to 4096x4096 per frame for ultra-high resolution (adjust as needed, but larger frames can take a lot of space and time).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"scale=4096:4096\" -vsync 1 -q:v 2 output_%04d.png\n```\n\nIf higher quality JPEGs are acceptable and your ffmpeg is built with the FFmpeg library, you can use .jpg extension which generally works the same way for direct extraction without quality override.PNG is more suitable for ultra high quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated appears to be logically consistent with the user’s request for extracting frames every 2 seconds and saving them as PNG images. The parameters used are appropriate for the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command it generated is syntactically correct and does not contain non-existent presets or commands. It correctly uses '-vf', '-vsync', and '-q:v' options that are valid according to ffmpeg’s documentation.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options being used in the command are valid:\n- `-vf \"scale=4096:4096\"` scales the video to ultra-high resolution.\n- `-vsync 1` effectively allows one frame to be extracted every 2 seconds, consistent with the user’s request.\n- `-q:v 2` specifies the quality of the output PNG images and is appropriate for high-quality images.\n- `output_%04d.png` correctly formats the output filenames.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is adequate and effectively meets the user's request without violating any of ffmpeg's operational guidelines. Consequently, this command should work correctly for the purpose specified by the user. It successfully extracts frames every 2 seconds from the video file into high-resolution PNG images."
