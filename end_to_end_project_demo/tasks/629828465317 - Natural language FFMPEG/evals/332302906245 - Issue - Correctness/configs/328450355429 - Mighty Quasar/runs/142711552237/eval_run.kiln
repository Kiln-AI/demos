  "output": "To chain the brightness, contrast, and scale filters, you combine them in the -vf filtergraph as a comma-separated list. The order is important: filters are applied left-to-right.\n\n- eq=brightness=0.1 boosts brightness (range ‑1.0 … 1.0; positive values brighten).\n- eq=contrast=1.2 raises contrast (range ‑2.0 … 2.0; values >1 increase contrast).\n- scale=-2:1080 resizes the video to 1080 px height while keeping the aspect ratio. The -2 makes the width automatically fit a given height modulo2 (required for yuv420p).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is coherent with the user's request to apply brightness and contrast filters and to resize the video to 1080p.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options, nor does it misuse the syntax of ffmpeg commands.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The sequence of operations follows the correct syntax, and there are no parameters that break the usage requirements.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and does not contain the issues described. The generated command appropriately reflects the user's request and conforms to the ffmpeg command requirements."
