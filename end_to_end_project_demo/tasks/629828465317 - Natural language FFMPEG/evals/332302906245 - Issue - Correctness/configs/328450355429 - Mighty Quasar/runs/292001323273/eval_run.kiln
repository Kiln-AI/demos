  "output": " ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -aspect 1:1 -ac 1 -vn audio.flac\n# Explanation:\n# - `-c:a libopus` specifies the audio codec as OPUS, which is an experimental codec.\n# - `-b:a 32k` sets the audio bitrate to 32 kbps.\n# - `-aspect 1:1` ensures the output audio has a 1:1 aspect ratio.\n# - `-ac 1` specifies a mono mix (single audio channel).\n# - `-vn` removes video stream from the output, as we are only interested in audio.\n# - `audio.flac` is the output file in FLAC format, which is lossless.\n# Note: If noise reduction is required, it typically involves applying a filter such as 'aecho' or using an external tool or plugin, but this cannot be directly represented in the command. A more complex command would be necessary for actual noise reduction, which might go beyond ffmpeg's simple filters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues described in the issue description. The command generated does not correctly extract the audio into a FLAC format, especially since it uses the Libopus codec, which is not compatible with FLAC format. Additionally, there's no implementation for applying noise reduction, which was specifically mentioned by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example since it uses a codec (`libopus`) that is not suitable for the FLAC format. However, it does not completely match the example since there isn't an outright erroneous syntax or a nonexistent preset; instead, it's a logical mismatch.\n\n3) The command specified does not align with the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page, particularly in the way codec selection and file compatibility are handled. The command is supposed to produce a FLAC file, but the given codec (`libopus`) is not valid for FLAC encoding. Instead, it should use `flac` as the audio codec. Also, there is no command related to noise reduction.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output fails because it does not correctly address the requirements of extracting audio into the FLAC format, nor does it include noise reduction as specified by the user. The selected codec is not valid for the output format, and there's no command provided to apply noise reduction. Thus, it fails the evaluation."
