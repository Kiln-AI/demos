  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To chain multiple video filters together, use the `-vf` (video filter) option with filters separated by commas. This applies brightness adjustment, contrast adjustment, and scaling to 1080p in a single processing pass.\n\n- `eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2` applies brightness (+0.1, range typically -1 to 1) and contrast (1.2 = 20% increase, 1.0 = no change)\n- `scale=-2:1080` scales to 1080p height while maintaining aspect ratio (-2 ensures width is divisible by 2)\n- The filters are applied in order: brightness → contrast → scaling\n\nI'm assuming you want moderate brightness/contrast adjustments. Adjust the values as needed:\n- Brightness: negative values darken, positive values brighten\n- Contrast: values < 1.0 reduce contrast, values > 1.0 increase contrast\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: I used `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding audio unnecessarily, but you can specify audio encoding if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command appears to match the user's requirements for applying a brightness filter, a contrast filter, and a scale filter for resizing to 1080p.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any invalid parameters, such as a nonexistent preset. Instead, it uses valid filter options and parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The chain of filters using `-vf` is correctly formatted, and the parameters used are valid for the specified filters.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described and therefore should pass the evaluation."
