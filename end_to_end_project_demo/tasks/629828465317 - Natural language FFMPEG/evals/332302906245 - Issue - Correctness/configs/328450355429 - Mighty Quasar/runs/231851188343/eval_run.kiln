  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file and save them into a new container, use the `-map` option. Here, `-map 0:4` selects the video stream 0:4 and `-map 0:9` selects the audio stream 0:9 from the input `broadcast.mkv`.\n\nIf you want to just copy the streams without re-encoding (which is faster and preserves original quality), use `-c copy`. If re-encoding is needed (due to compatibility or format constraints), specify codecs accordingly.\n\nAssuming your selected streams are compatible with MP4 and you want to keep them without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nIf you face compatibility issues or want to ensure MP4 compatibility, re-encode the video and audio streams to H.264 and AAC:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nBy default, the entire duration will be kept unless you specify trimming options. If you want to trim specific parts, please provide start/end times or durations.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command provided correctly selects the specific video and audio streams specified by the user from the input file and saves them into a new output file. The command is accurately constructed based on the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command generated does not include any incorrect or nonexistent options, such as the `-preset extra_fast` which is invalid. The command uses the `-map` and `-c copy` options appropriately, which are valid and functional for the specified operation.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax with the `-map` options, specifies the input file, and uses `-c copy`, which is valid for copying streams without re-encoding. Additionally, the alternative option for optional re-encoding is also valid and aligns with the requirements.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output should pass the evaluation criteria, as it generates a correct and functional command without any issues. The command adheres to the user requirements and complies with the ffmpeg command structure."
