  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise, you can use the `transpose` filter (which rotates by 90 degrees). For advanced noise reduction, `hqdn3d` filter offers a high-quality denoising option with many adjustable parameters; setting these to higher values increases the strength of noise reduction. \n\n- `-vf transpose=1` rotates 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `hqdn3d` with higher parameters (`luma_spatial`, `chroma_spatial`, `luma_tmp`, `chroma_tmp`) applies strong noise reduction.\n\nHere's the command assuming your input filename is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=20:20:30:30\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- You want to preserve the original audio (`-c:a copy`).  \n- `hqdn3d=20:20:30:30` applies strong noise reduction.  \n- Using libx264 with a reasonably high quality (`crf 18`).\n\nIf your input or output filenames are different, please replace accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command seems valid and aligns with the user’s request to rotate the video and apply strong noise reduction. The use of `transpose` for rotation and `hqdn3d` for noise reduction are appropriate and correctly implemented.\n\n2) The model's output command is not similar to the given failure example. The command is syntactically correct, and it uses valid parameters that exist within the ffmpeg options. Therefore, it does not present an error of that nature.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. Each specified filter and option is valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. The `transpose` filter is used correctly for the clockwise rotation, and `hqdn3d` is configured with values that are supported for noise reduction. \n\n4) Based on the evaluation process, the model's output does not contain issues, offers a valid command that should work correctly in accordance with the user’s requirements, and adheres to the ffmpeg command syntax and options outlined in the man page. Hence, it passes the evaluation."
