  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "You want to extract the third audio stream and the first video stream from `movie.mkv` and save it as `final.mp4`.  This involves selecting specific streams and muxing them into a new container.\n\n- `select` is used to choose specific streams. We specify the third audio stream (index 2, as indexing starts from 0) and the first video stream (index 0).\n- `copy` is used to copy the selected streams without re-encoding, which is faster and preserves quality.\n- We use `mp4` as the output format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is valid and matches the user's requirements of extracting the specified audio and video streams correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is syntactically correct and utilizes valid parameters for the `ffmpeg` command, ensuring that it would work properly.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the `-map` options to specify which video and audio streams to extract and employs the `-c copy` option to copy streams without re-encoding, which is a proper usage of the tool.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command provided is correct, appropriate for the task, and it meets the user's requirements seamlessly. Thus, the evaluation should pass."
