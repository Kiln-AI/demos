  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To shrink video.mp4 to a size that will reliably fit through email (e.g. ≤ 20–25 MB), we’ll re-encode with very aggressive settings: lower resolution (480 p), lower frame-rate (24 fps), more efficient H.264 preset, and lowered audio quality. This will visibly reduce quality, but the file will be dramatically smaller. Adjust the `-crf` value upward (26–28) if the result is still too large, or downward for slightly better quality.\n\n- filter fps=24 cuts the frame-rate to 24 fps.  \n- vf scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:480' forces height to 480 px and keeps the aspect ratio (width is auto-calculated and rounded to even).  \n- preset veryslow gives the best compression per bit.  \n- crf 25 balances size vs. visual loss; raise it (28) for a smaller file or lower (20) if more quality is desired.  \n- c:a aac -b:a 64k uses minimal acceptable audio bitrate.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -filter_complex \"fps=24,scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:480'\" \\\n  -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 25 \\\n  -c:a aac -b:a 64k \\\n  video_small.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output generated by the model does not contain any mistakes in the `ffmpeg` command it produces. All the options used in the command are valid according to the `ffmpeg` man page, and it follows the proper structure for applying options to the input file and producing the output file.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command produced by the model contains valid options, with correct syntax and existing presets. The example failing output (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) includes an invalid preset (`extra_fast`), which is not the case here.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. Each specified command-line option is valid and adheres to the expected format, ensuring the options are correctly applied to the specified input and output files.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It successfully generates a correct `ffmpeg` command that adheres to the requirements and produces a valid output. Overall, the model performed well in this instance."
