  "output": "To map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the input file to output.mp4, use the `-map` option to select the desired streams.\n\n-   `-map 0:5` selects the sixth stream (index 5, as the index starts at 0) from the input file (index 0).  This will be the video stream.\n-   `-map 0:8` selects the ninth stream (index 8) from the input file (index 0). This will be the audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:5 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is correct as it uses the `-map` option properly to select video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the input file, and it specifies a valid output format (`output.mp4`). \n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and should execute without errors, while the failure example contains an incorrect preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used (`-map` and `-c copy`) are valid and appropriately applied to their respective streams. The model has also correctly accounted for stream indexing starting at 0 when mapping the streams.\n\n4) Since the model's output is correct, does not resemble the failure example, and does not violate any stipulations in the ffmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation with regard to the outlined criteria."
