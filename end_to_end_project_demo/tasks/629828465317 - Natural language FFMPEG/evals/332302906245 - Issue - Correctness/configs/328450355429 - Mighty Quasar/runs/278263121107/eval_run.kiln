  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize the shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4` using FFmpeg's `deshake` filter, we apply motion compensation by analyzing frames and adjusting for small shifts. The `deshake` filter uses default parameters unless specified; these typically include thresholds for movement correction (e.g., 10 frames of input history for smoother stabilization). Audio is copied without re-encoding to preserve the original stream, and the output is saved as an MP4 with H.264 by default (if not already in that format). No additional parameters are set for resolution or quality unless required.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy stabilized_output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made**:\n1. Stabilization with minimal parameters to address light-to-moderate shaking.\n2. Audio codec compatibility with the input (uses `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding).\n3. Output format is MP4; if the input already uses H.264, the video codec is preserved. Otherwise, output will inherit the current video codec.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command provided (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy stabilized_output.mp4`) correctly matches the requirements for stabilizing the video using the `deshake` filter. The command is valid and will work as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command created by the model does not have any invalid or nonexistent options, such as the `preset extra_fast` error in the failure example. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of the `-vf` option for applying the `deshake` filter is correct, and `-c:a copy` is appropriately used to copy the audio stream without re-encoding. The options provided do not conflict with any stipulated in the man page.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation:**  \nThe model's output is correct, effective, and adheres to the requirements. It does not contain any mistakes pertaining to the generated command. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation successfully."
