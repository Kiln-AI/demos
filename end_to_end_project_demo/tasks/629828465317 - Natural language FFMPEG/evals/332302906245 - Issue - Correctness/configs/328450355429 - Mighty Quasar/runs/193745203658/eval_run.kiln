  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds at ultra high resolution, we will use the fps filter to set the frame extraction interval, and save the output as PNG files. The \"ultra high resolution\" assumes you want to keep the original quality at the video's native resolution without downscaling. PNG is a lossless format, so this preserves frame quality.\n\n- -vf \"fps=1/2\" extracts one frame every 2 seconds.\n- frame_%04d.png saves frames sequentially with zero-padded numbering.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=1/2\" frame_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly applies the user request to extract frames every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images without introducing any erroneous parameters or misconfigurations.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command `ffmpeg -i input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails due to the non-existence of `-preset extra_fast`. In the model's output, the command does not contain any invalid options; it is valid and should work to extract frames as specified.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It uses valid syntax for input file specification, applies a video filter with `-vf \"fps=1/2\"` correctly, and specifies the output format as sequential PNG images `frame_%04d.png`. All parts of the command align with the documented usage of FFmpeg.\n\nOverall, the model's output is appropriate and meets the requirements of the user request, producing a valid and functioning ffmpeg command. It does not contain errors, deviates from invalid examples, or violate any guidelines from the ffmpeg man page. Thus, it can be deemed successful."
