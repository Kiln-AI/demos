  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",

  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided criteria, let's analyze the outputs step by step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The model's output is `ffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.mp4`. This command properly maps video stream 10 and audio stream 18 from the input file `broadcast.ts` and copies them without re-encoding. Since the command adheres to the requirements from the user, it does **not contain the issue** described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The example of a failing output is `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`, which contains an incorrect `preset` option that does not exist. The model's output does not contain any invalid commands or parameters like `extra_fast`. The model's output is valid, as it uses correct and recognized parameters. Therefore, it is **not similar to the failing output**.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command follows the general syntax and mapping specifications outlined in the man page. It correctly specifies stream mappings with `-map` and uses `-c copy` to preserve the original quality by copying streams without re-encoding. Since the command adheres to the rules and examples provided in the man page, it **does not break any requirements**.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain any issues. The command it generated successfully meets the user's request without any errors or invalid parameters. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is accurate, appropriate, and adheres to the requirements of the user's request as well as the guidelines from the FFmpeg man page. Thus, it passes the evaluation successfully."
