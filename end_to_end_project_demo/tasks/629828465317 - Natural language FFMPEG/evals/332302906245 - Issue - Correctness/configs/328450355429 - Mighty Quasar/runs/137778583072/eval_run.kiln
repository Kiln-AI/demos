  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert your video to a small MP4 file suitable for email attachment, use the `ffmpeg` command with x264 H.264 video codec, AAC audio codec, and high efficiency encoding options.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding.\n- `-crf 18` sets maximum quality (lower is better; 18 is a good default for a small file size).\n- `-preset fastest` or `-b:v 50k` limits the bitrate to get a small file size (you can adjust the bitrate further for a smaller file).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older devices.\n- `-movflags +faststart` places metadata at the beginning for efficient streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset fastest -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nPlease note: The video resolution of 4K already implies high compression. Using such a low value for `crf` might degrade some scenes. A compromise can be: `-crf 24`. Alternatively, you may aim to maintain better video and adjust file size and video quality such that both become acceptable.\n\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The desired output mp4 file supports both `yuv420p` and `mp4` containers which is widely supported by browsers.\n- The mp4 output might not fit 4K in the attachments while keeping quality, consider to confirm further or offer a medium size output when using 4K file for maximum impact.\n\nAssumptions from the example prompt:\nInput file size and actual compression do not align due to the use of large 4K compression, however it serves as a basic guideline and will help you create more compact files if compressed with high efficiency (`-crf 18`, `-preset fastest`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated with `-crf 18` is not appropriate for achieving a small file size that is required for email attachments, especially with a 4K resolution input. Additionally, the use of `-preset fastest` does not align with the goal of file size reduction as this preset tends to prioritize encoding speed over compression efficiency. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided failure example as it doesn't contain a non-existent preset. However, the parameters are not optimal for achieving the requested goals of compression size and resolution.\n\n3) Referring to the man page, the command does not break any direct requirements dictated there, but the choice of parameters such as `-crf 18` and `-preset fastest` could result in a large output file size due to the high-quality encoding not suited to the user's request for a small file size. Thus, while it does not outright \"break\" any commands, it fails to fulfill the user's request effectively.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output indeed contains issues as it does not provide a suitable command that meets the user's request for converting to MP4 format with a small file size specifically appropriate for email attachment. The command should have incorporated parameters like a higher `-crf` value (24 or higher) or a lower bitrate to ensure a manageable file size while dealing with 4K resolution."
