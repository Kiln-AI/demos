  "input": "I need to convert input.mov to AVI format using the libx263 video codec and mp3 audio",
  "output": "To convert input.mov to AVI format with libx263 video codec and MP3 audio, you'll use the legacy H.263 encoder and LAME MP3 encoder.\n\nNote: I assume you meant \"libx263\" but this codec doesn't exist in ffmpeg. I'll use \"h263\" which is the actual H.263 codec available. If you specifically need a different codec, please clarify.\n\n- `-c:v h263` uses the H.263 video codec (legacy format, mainly for older devices)\n- `-c:a mp3` or `-c:a libmp3lame` encodes audio to MP3 format\n- `-b:v 1M` sets video bitrate to 1 Mbps (H.263 typically uses lower bitrates)\n- `-b:a 128k` sets audio bitrate to 128 kbps\n- H.263 has limitations on resolution and frame rates, so the output may be adjusted automatically\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v h263 -b:v 1M -c:a mp3 -b:a 128k output.avi\n```\n\nIf you encounter issues with H.263 (as it's quite old and has strict limitations), consider using H.264 instead with `-c:v libx264` for better compatibility and quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The model incorrectly refers to the codec \"libx263\", which does not exist in FFmpeg. Instead, it correctly suggests using \"h263\", but the mistake in mentioning \"libx263\" indicates confusion that could lead to an incorrect command. Therefore, this violates the user's request for a command that works correctly.\n\n2) The output is similar to the provided failure example because it contains an erroneous codec name (\"libx263\"). In this instance, while \"h263\" is correctly used in the command, the mention of \"libx263\" is misleading and potentially confusing for the user, making it a failing output.\n\n3) The command itself, `ffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v h263 -b:v 1M -c:a mp3 -b:a 128k output.avi`, does not break any explicit requirements dictated in the man page. It specifies valid parameters for encoding the output file in AVI format using H.263 for video and MP3 for audio, following proper syntax and options.\n\n4) The model's output fails due to the confusion surrounding the codec name \"libx263\" which does not exist. Although the output command itself can work if correctly using \"h263\", the reference to the nonexistent codec indicates a lack of precision in the output, which is essential for generating correct FFmpeg commands. Thus, it fails to generate a clear and valid command as required by the user."
