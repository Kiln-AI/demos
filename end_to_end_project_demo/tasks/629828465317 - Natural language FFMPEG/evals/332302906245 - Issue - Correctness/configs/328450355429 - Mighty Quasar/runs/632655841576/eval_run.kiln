  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge several MP4 files without re-encoding (which preserves quality and speeds up processing), use ffmpeg's \"concat demuxer\" method. Create a text file (e.g., videos.txt) listing the input files, then use ffmpeg to concat them using -f concat and -safe 0 (required for file paths with special characters or absolute paths).\n\nExample content of videos.txt:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\nAssuming all files have the same codec and resolution, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i videos.txt -c copy merged.mp4\n```\n\n- -f concat specifies the concat demuxer.\n- -safe 0 allows absolute or relative paths in the list.\n- -i videos.txt reads the list of MP4 files to concatenate.\n- -c copy copies the streams without re-encoding, preserving quality.\n\nThis is the most efficient and lossless way to merge MP4 files in ffmpeg.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It generates an appropriate `ffmpeg` command that is expected to work correctly for merging the specified video files without re-encoding, given that the inputs are compatible.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output (ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4). The command produced by the model appears correctly formatted, and all specified options are valid according to `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n3) The command produced by the model follows the requirements stated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It appropriately specifies the format using `-f concat` and follows the structure required for input and output files without any conflicting options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any identified issues according to the evaluation criteria given and performs according to the specifications, it should pass the evaluation."
