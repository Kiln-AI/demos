    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated accurately meets the requirements of the user to extract specific video and audio streams from the input file and save them as specified. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The options specified in the command (such as `-map`, `-c:v copy`, and `-c:a copy`) are valid and correct. There are no invalid or non-existent options used. Therefore, it does not exemplify a failure in the command production. \n\n3) The command complies with the requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly specifies stream mapping using the `-map` option and uses the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options, which are appropriate for copying the selected streams without re-encoding. The order of the options is also correct according to the general rules for `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and appropriate for the stated user request. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
