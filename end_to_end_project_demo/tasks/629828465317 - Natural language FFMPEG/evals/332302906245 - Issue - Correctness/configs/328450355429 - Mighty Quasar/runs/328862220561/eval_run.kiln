  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from an input file, the `-map` option is used. Stream indices start from 0. You asked to map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream, which means we'll use indices 6 for the video (`-map 0:v:6`) and 13 for the audio (`-map 0:a:13`), assuming all streams belong to the same input.\n\nHere is the command assuming a single input file named `input.mov` and output file `output.mov`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis will copy the selected streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`) to preserve quality and speed. If you want to re-encode, replace `-c copy` with appropriate codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding, which matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is valid and correctly structured, while the failure example contains a nonexistent preset which would fail execution.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It uses valid parameters and follows the correct syntax for selecting streams with the `-map` option.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described (it generates a correct and valid command), this would result in a PASS. The command accurately meets the user's request to map the specific streams and is syntactically and functionally correct according to FFmpeg usage guidelines."
