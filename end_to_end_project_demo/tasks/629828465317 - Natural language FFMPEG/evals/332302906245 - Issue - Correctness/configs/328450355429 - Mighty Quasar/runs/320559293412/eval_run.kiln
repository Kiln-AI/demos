I'll also specify a CRF value for video quality and a bitrate for audio.\n\n- `libvpx` is the video codec.\n- `libopus` is the audio codec.\n- `-crf 23` sets the video quality (lower values mean higher quality, 23 is a good starting point).\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128kbps.\n-  I'm assuming you want to preserve the original aspect ratio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 23 -c:a libopus -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is syntactically correct and meets the requirement of converting an MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is properly structured and utilizes valid codec options. Unlike the failure example, the `preset extra_fast` does not appear, which is a nonexistent preset; instead, the model has chosen appropriate codecs that are recognized by FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used align with the expected usage of `ffmpeg`, and there are no incorrect or unsupported parameters in the command. The command correctly specifies input and output files as well as the necessary codec options.\n\n4) Overall, since the output meets all requirements without syntax errors or unsupported options, it should be considered a correct execution of the task. \n\nPass."
