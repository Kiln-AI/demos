  "input": "Convert my file.mp4 to WebM format using the vp8 codec with the veryslow preset",
  "output": "To convert file.mp4 to WebM format using the VP8 codec, use the libvpx encoder with the veryslow preset for better compression efficiency, though it will encode slower. WebM typically uses Vorbis or Opus for audio; here, we'll use libvorbis for compatibility.\n\n- c:v libvpx selects the VP8 video codec.\n- -deadline good provides a balance between speed and quality; to achieve best compression use -deadline best (or in this case veryslow preset).\n- -cpu-used 0 indicates the slowest encoding (highest quality) for libvpx.\n- -preset veryslow is not a direct option for libvpx; instead, we use -cpu-used 0 and -deadline best to mimic a very slow preset.\n- c:a libvorbis encodes audio with Vorbis codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -cpu-used 0 -deadline best -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\n\nNote: libvpx does not have a -preset option like libx264. Instead, quality/speed are controlled with -cpu-used and -deadline. For veryslow, use -cpu-used 0 and -deadline best.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated by the model is valid for converting an MP4 file to WebM format using the VP8 codec and appears well-constructed according to the user's request. The options chosen effectively communicate the intent to achieve a \"veryslow\" encoding equivalent.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The failure example cited an incorrect preset option (`-preset extra_fast`) which does not exist. In contrast, the model accurately described how to achieve a very slow preset through alternative parameters (`-cpu-used 0` and `-deadline best`), therefore this output is valid.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. All used options are correctly specified (e.g., `-c:v libvpx` for VP8 codec, `-c:a libvorbis` for audio encoding), and there are no misapplied or invalid options. The use of `-cpu-used` and `-deadline` to effectively mimic a veryslow preset is a valid engineering choice based on the codec's capabilities.\n\nThus, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the user's input and sufficiently meets the requirements while adhering to the ffmpeg documentation. The command generated is appropriate and should work correctly for the intended transformation."
