  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 using the libx264 codec with the instant preset for fastest encoding",
  "output": "To convert `input.avi` to MP4 using the **libx264** codec with the fastest encoding, use the `-preset ultrafast` parameter (since libx264 does not have a \"instant\" preset; `ultrafast` is the fastest available). Apply the default CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value of **23** for balanced quality and file size. Also include AAC audio encoding for compatibility with browsers, ensure pixel format compatibility with `yuv420p`, and add `-movflags +faststart` for streaming readiness.\n\n### Explanation of key parameters:\n- `-c:v libx264`: Use the H.264 video codec.\n- `-preset ultrafast`: Maximize encoding speed (no trade-off in file size).\n- `-crf 23`: Standard middle-ground quality setting.\n- `-c:a aac`: Encode audio to AAC, the most widely supported audio codec in browsers.\n- `-b:a 128k`: Default audio bit rate for decent MP4 quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensure output file is compatible with most players and browsers.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Makes MP4 start playing before the entire file is downloaded.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need to resize the video, explicitly add `-vf scale=<width>:<height>:` (e.g., `scale=1280:720`) or use the original resolution as shown here. The source resolution is preserved unless specified otherwise.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue_description. The generated command correctly adheres to the user's request to convert from `input.avi` to MP4 using the `libx264` codec with the ultrafast preset, which is the fastest available. It assumes the need for audio and the default quality settings, which is reasonable.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure_example. The output demonstrates a proper understanding of `ffmpeg` parameters, and terms used (like `-preset`, and `-c:v`) are in line with `ffmpeg` commands. The failure_example features a command with a non-existent preset, whereas the output correctly refers to the `ultrafast` preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly applies options to the next specified file, uses valid codec names, and parameters conform to `ffmpeg` specifications.\n\n4) Since the model's output passes the necessary checks, it does not contain the issue described in the issue_description and will therefore pass the evaluation."
