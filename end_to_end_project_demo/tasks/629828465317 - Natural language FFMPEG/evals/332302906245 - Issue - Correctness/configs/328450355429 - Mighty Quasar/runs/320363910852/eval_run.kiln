  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in a specified order using ffmpeg, you need to chain the filters in the correct sequence using the `-vf` option.\n\n- Temporal noise reduction can be done using `tmix` (temporal mixing) or `liq` (temporal median filter) filters. Another popular choice is the `minterpolate` filter for motion-compensated temporal denoising, but it is more complex.\n- Spatial denoising can be achieved using `hqdn3d` or `nlmeans`. `hqdn3d` is fast and commonly used.\n- Edge enhancement can be done using `unsharp` filter to sharpen the image.\n\nAssuming you want to do temporal noise reduction first, then spatial denoising, then edge enhancement, the filter chain looks like this:\n\n1. Temporal noise reduction: `tmix` (or `minterpolate`/`avgblur` or another)\n2. Spatial denoising: `hqdn3d`\n3. Edge enhancement: `unsharp`\n\nExample filter chain syntax:\n\n```bash\n-vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1', hqdn3d=4:3:6:4, unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\"\n```\n\nThis example:  \n- `tmix` averages 5 frames temporally to reduce noise over time. Weights are uniform for simple average.  \n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4` applies spatial denoising with specified strength parameters for luma and chroma channels.  \n- `unsharp` sharpens luma details with a kernel size of 7x7 and intensity 1.5.\n\nHere is the full example command with placeholder input/output files:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1',hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes you want to keep audio unchanged (`-c:a copy`). Adjust numerical parameters to suit your noise level and sharpening preference.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command provided includes valid filter syntax and transformations without any syntax errors or incorrect options that would cause the command to fail.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output command (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1',hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4`) uses valid options and correctly specifies a filter chain, unlike the failing example which features an invalid preset.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The parameters used (such as `-vf` for video filters, `-c:a copy` to keep the audio unchanged, and the filter syntax itself) are all in line with the documentation provided. The use of filters like `tmix`, `hqdn3d`, and `unsharp` is appropriate and follows the expected syntax for filter chains.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues. Therefore, it should be classified as a pass."
