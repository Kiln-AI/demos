  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "To merge multiple audio tracks (e.g., track1.wav, track2.wav, track3.wav) into a single audio file, you can use the `amerge` filter to combine them and export as FLAC using the `-compression_level 12` (which is what FFmpeg's studio_master preset sets for FLAC). High-quality FLAC export will preserve the original audio fidelity.\n\n- `-filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a][2:a]amerge=inputs=3[aout]\"` merges three inputs (adjust `inputs=` for your track count).\n- `-map \"[aout]\"` selects the merged audio stream for output.\n- `-ac 2` sets the output to stereo; make sure it's appropriate for your inputs (or increase if you desire more channels).\n- `-c:a flac -compression_level 12` uses FLAC with maximum compression, as per studio_master preset.\n\nAssuming your input files are named track1.wav, track2.wav, and track3.wav:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i track1.wav -i track2.wav -i track3.wav -filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a][2:a]amerge=inputs=3[aout]\" -map \"[aout]\" -c:a flac -compression_level 12 -ac 2 merged_studio_master.flac\n```\n\nIf you have a different number of tracks, adjust the `[0:a][1:a][2:a]` and `inputs=3` fields accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command appears to be correctly structured according to the requirements of merging multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and exporting as high-quality FLAC.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command \"ffmpeg -i input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4\" would fail due to a nonexistent `extra_fast` preset, whereas the model's output correctly specifies using the `-compression_level 12` option for FLAC, which is consistent with the user's request for a high-quality export.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All options and parameters used are valid and correspond to the intended functionality of merging audio tracks and exporting them as FLAC with the appropriate compression settings.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation steps, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is appropriate for the task at hand and adheres to the guidelines set by the man page, so it passes evaluation."
