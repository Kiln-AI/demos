  "input": "I want to convert video.webm to MP4 using the h264 codec with the lightning preset",
  "output": "To convert `video.webm` to an MP4 format using the H.264 codec and the \"lightning\" preset, we use the following approach:\n\n- `-i video.webm`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264`: Selects the H.264 video codec for encoding.\n- `-preset lightning`: Uses the lightning preset, which is optimized for fast encoding at the expense of compression efficiency.\n- `-c:a aac`: Repacks or re-encodes the audio using the AAC codec if needed (commonly used with MP4 and compatible with most browsers).\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Makes the file suitable for streaming by moving the metadata to the beginning.\n\nThe video stream will be re-encoded, and the audio stream will be passed through or re-encoded to AAC if it's not already in that format. This assumes the audio should also be compatible with MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset lightning -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly uses the parameters `-c:v libx264` and `-preset lightning`, which suggest that the model has understood the userâ€™s request to convert from `.webm` to `.mp4` using the specified codec and preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command uses a valid preset `lightning`, which is recognized in FFmpeg, unlike the `extra_fast` preset from the failure example, which does not exist.\n\n3) The FFmpeg man page does not indicate any broken requirements in the command produced by the model. The parameters specified -c:v, -preset, -c:a, and -movflags are valid and properly ordered according to the guidelines in the man page. There is no violation of the general rule about order being important for options.\n\n4) Since the model's command correctly implements the user's request without using invalid parameters, we can conclude that it passes this evaluation based on the criteria provided."
