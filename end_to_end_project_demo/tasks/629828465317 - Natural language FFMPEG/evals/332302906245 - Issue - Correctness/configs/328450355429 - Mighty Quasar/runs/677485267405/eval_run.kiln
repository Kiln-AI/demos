  "input": "I need to convert my 4K video to 1080p MP4 with libx265 codec, but I also want to use the ultrafast preset and maintain the highest quality possible with CRF 0.",
  "output": "To convert your 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the libx265 codec with the ultrafast preset and CRF 0 for the highest quality, here's the command:\n\n- `scale=-2:1080` resizes the video to 1080p height while maintaining aspect ratio. The `-2` means that the width is automatically calculated to maintain the aspect ratio and that the resulting value is divisible by 2 (which is a requirement of libx265)\n- `-c:v libx265` specifies the H.265 (HEVC) video codec.\n- `-preset ultrafast` selects the ultrafast encoding preset, trading off compression efficiency for encoding speed. Keep in mind that ultrafast is not recommended for final encodes because it will result in larger file sizes for any given quality.\n- `-x265-params crf=0` sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) to 0, which is near lossless (highest quality). Be aware that this will result in very large file sizes.\n- `-c:a copy` streams copy the audio from the input file into the output file without re-encoding. This is generally the fastest and most efficient option when the audio is already in a suitable format.\n- `-tag:v hvc1` adds the hvc1 tag to the video stream. Some players may require this tag to properly identify that the video stream is encoded with h265.\n\nI'm assuming that the audio in your input file is already in a format suitable for MP4, and that you want to keep it as is. If your audio needs to be converted too, let me know the desired audio codec and bitrate.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx265 -preset ultrafast -x265-params crf=0 -c:a copy -tag:v hvc1 output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output does not contain any issues. The command provided by the model is syntactically correct and aligns with the user's request to convert a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the libx265 codec with the ultrafast preset and CRF 0 for the highest quality. The explanation is accurate and corresponds well to the command generated.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the output is not similar to the failing example. The model has generated a valid command that correctly uses existing options and takes into consideration the user's specifications. There are no non-existent preset names or codecs in the output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the prescribed syntax and uses valid options and parameters as outlined. The scaling is correctly applied, the codec names are accurate, and the parameters used are all valid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes the evaluation. The command it generated is valid, adheres to the parameters requested by the user, and is compliant with the ffmpeg man page."
