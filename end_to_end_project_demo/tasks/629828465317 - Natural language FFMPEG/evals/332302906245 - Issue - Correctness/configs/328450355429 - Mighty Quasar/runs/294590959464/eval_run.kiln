  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream MKV file using `ffmpeg`, you can use the `-map` option to select the streams by their index. Assuming the indexing for streams starts from 0 in `ffmpeg` and that the first video stream is 0, video stream 12 would likely be `-map 0:v:12`, and audio stream 25 would be `-map 0:a:25`. The output will include only these selected streams.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n### Explanation of Options:\n- `-map 0:v:12`: Selects the 13th video stream (index 12) from the input file (`recording.mkv`).\n- `-map 0:a:25`: Selects the 26th audio stream (index 25) from the input file.\n- `-c copy`: Copies the selected streams without re-encoding (faster and lossless).\n- `output.mkv`: The resulting file containing only the 12th video and 25th audio stream from the original.\n\n> **Assumption**: The command assumes the file is in MKV format and contains multiple video and audio streams with proper indexing. If `ffmpeg` reports issues about missing streams or invalid indices, you can list all the streams in the file with `ffmpeg -i recording.mkv` to verify their actual indices.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**   \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately reflects the user's request to select specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream MKV file. The usage of the `-map` option to specify the streams within the command is appropriate and correct.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command produced by the model is correctly formed and uses valid options consistent with the `ffmpeg` man page.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used (`-map`, `-c copy`) are standard and correctly applied. The model also assumed proper indexing of streams, which adheres to the `ffmpeg` requirements that start numbering from zero.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generated a correct and effective `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's requirements and adheres to the guidelines from the man page. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
