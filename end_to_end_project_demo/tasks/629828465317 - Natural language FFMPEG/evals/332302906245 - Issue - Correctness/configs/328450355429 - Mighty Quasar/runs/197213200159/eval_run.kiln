  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To extract a specific video stream and audio stream and combine them into a new MP4 file, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` option. The input file recording.mov contains multiple streams, and we want video from stream #0:2 (third video stream) and audio from stream #1:3 (fourth audio stream).\n\nSince you're mapping specific streams without re-encoding, I'm using stream copy (-c copy) to avoid quality loss and faster processing. I'm also setting output format to MP4 with default settings suitable for most use cases.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 1:a:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- Recording.mov has at least 3 video streams (0:0, 0:1, 0:2) and at least 4 audio streams (0:3)\n- Both streams are compatible with MP4 container format (common formats like H.264/H.265 for video and AAC/PCM for audio)\n- You're fine with keeping the original quality (no re-encoding)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it produced accurately reflects the user's request to combine a specific video stream and audio stream from the input file into a new MP4 file. The command utilizes the `-map` option correctly to specify the input streams, and the use of `-c copy` is appropriate for maintaining the original quality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain any invalid parameter or syntax. The example of failing output given (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) lists a non-existent preset, which is not the case with the modelâ€™s output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct syntax and structure for specifying input files, mappings, and output options. The use of `-map` is also consistent with the ability to select streams in FFmpeg, and the command is formatted as required by the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output does **not contain** the issue described. The command produced is appropriate and meets the user's requirements, passing all checks."
