  "output": "To stack `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4` vertically, I'll use the `vstack` filter. This filter requires that the inputs have the same width. I'll assume that both videos have the same width. If the videos have different widths you must scale them to the same width as a prepocessing step.\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 stacked.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 stacked.mp4`) is syntactically correct and fulfills the user's request to stack two videos vertically.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command produced is valid and does not contain any non-existent options or syntactical errors. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input files and applies the `vstack` filter to create the desired output file.\n\n4) Since the model's output is correct and matches the user requirements without any errors or misconfigurations, it should pass the evaluation."
