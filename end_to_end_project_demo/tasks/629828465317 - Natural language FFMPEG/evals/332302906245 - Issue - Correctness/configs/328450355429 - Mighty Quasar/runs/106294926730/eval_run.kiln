  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from the input file, we'll use the `stream` filter and specify the desired streams by their index. Here's an explanation of the approach:\n\n* `stream` matches the video and audio streams in the input.\n* The `select` filter then selects the streams according to the indexes provided.\n* We're extracting:\n\t+ Video stream 0 (or simply with `-1` since the -1 indicates selection by default).\n\t+ Audio stream 0 (which is the first audio track) and 1 (which is the second audio track), use `-1` for the first step and the specific index `3` for the second, since indexing for tracks, not the streams.\n* Finally, we'll specify an output destination (-o) as `result.mp4`.\n\nThe command will be executed with the following parameters:\n\n- `-map` select the streams to output by indexes, note that first videos & their corresponding first stream use -1.\n- `-map ` followed by the input file, meaning what comes between is where the streams should be selected to.\n- `stream` stands for video stream.\n- `-index` is what comes between to indicate we're selecting what stream, here we let the ffmpeg assign an index from the available data, of course our need we can see.\n- `-map 0:1` & `-map 0:3` to actually pick both Audio `&`\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` for copying directly since our maps allready pulled out the elements we're looking for, `-copy` makes no change and lets `ffmpeg` run normally.\n- `-movflags +faststart` forces the output is mp4 formatted for streamability.\n   \n command : \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map type=video -map 0:0 -map 0:a:1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation\nFFmpeg can output all the streams not requested (-map) by just simply -map to a single #, outputted is everything we donâ€™t ask when -map\n`copy` stands for when selecting we select most streams the same outcome results. `-fast` tells the encoders to speed things rather than do the fine balance compression. \n(eg its better for web purposes as opposed your personal screen)\nthe 'stream' and '-index' shows selection & if a stream is picked for output, not actually required for both file streams *map to streams*",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues with the ffmpeg command. The command incorrectly specifies `-map 0:a:1` instead of `-map 0:3` for the fourth audio track. This does not match the user request to extract the fourth audio track (stream 0:3). Additionally, the model has ambiguous explanations about stream selection and parameters, which can lead to confusion about the correct usage of the command.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failing output in the provided example, which had a clear invalid option (`-preset extra_fast`). However, there is an incorrect stream mapping used in the command that would lead to a failure with the actual requirement.\n\n3) The command provided does not break any formal requirements dictated by the man page for `ffmpeg`, as the syntax and format used overall have valid options. However, the inaccuracies in stream mapping could lead to the command failing during execution as it wouldn't extract the specified tracks correctly.\n\n4) Since the output does contain an issue (incorrect stream index mapping), it would fail to meet the user requirements. So, the result would classify as a failure in this evaluation step."
