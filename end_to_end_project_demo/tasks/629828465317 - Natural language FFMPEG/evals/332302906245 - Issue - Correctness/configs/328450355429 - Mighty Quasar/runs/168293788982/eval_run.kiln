  "output": "To extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of `broadcast.ts` and combine them into a new file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`.  The `-map` option allows you to specify which streams from the input file(s) should be included in the output file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.ts\n```\n\nThis command tells `ffmpeg` to:\n- `-i broadcast.ts`:  Specify `broadcast.ts` as the input file.\n- `-map 0:10`: Select stream 10 (video) from the first input file (index 0).\n- `-map 0:18`: Select stream 18 (audio) from the first input file (index 0).\n- `-c copy`:  Use stream copying for both video and audio, which means no re-encoding will occur and the streams will be included as is saving processing time.\n- `output.ts`: Specify the output file name as `output.ts`.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated successfully extracts the specified video and audio streams from the input file `broadcast.ts` and combines them into a new file without any apparent mistakes or conflicts with user requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command `ffmpeg -i input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` shows a clear error in the option used (invalid preset), while the model's command properly utilizes the `-map` option with valid stream indices.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All parameters used are correct and consistent with the documented options. The use of the `-map` option and `-c copy` directive is compliant with the expected syntax and functionalities described.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and does not contain any issues as per the criteria set out in the evaluation. The command successfully fulfills the user's request to extract a video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of the specified input file and combines them into a new output file. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
