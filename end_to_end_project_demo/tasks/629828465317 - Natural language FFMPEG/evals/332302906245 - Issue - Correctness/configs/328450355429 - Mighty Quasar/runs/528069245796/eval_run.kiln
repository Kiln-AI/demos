  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark to the bottom left corner, we'll use the `overlay` filter along with `format=rgba` and `colorchannelmixer` to adjust the alpha (transparency) of the logo image. The `overlay=x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h` positions the logo at the bottom left. \n\nHere's the command assuming you want the watermark at about 50% opacity:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[wm];[0][wm]overlay=x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h\" -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[wm]`: converts logo.png to RGBA and sets alpha channel to 0.5 for semi-transparency.\n- `[0][wm]overlay=x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h`: overlays watermark on bottom left.\n- `-c:a copy`: copies audio without re-encoding.\n\nAssumption: You want roughly 50% transparency and the output container and codec support the overlays without re-encoding audio. Adjust `aa=0.5` for different transparency levels.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance based on the provided criteria:\n\n1. **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \n   The output provided seems to correctly generate an `ffmpeg` command that adds a semi-transparent watermark to the video. The command uses the appropriate filters and parameters. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described regarding generating a command that does not work correctly.\n\n2. **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   The output is not similar to the failing output example. The produced command is syntactically correct and appropriately uses `overlay` and `colorchannelmixer`. It does not include any invalid options like the nonexistent `preset extra_fast` in the example.\n\n3. **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   The command follows the general structure outlined in the man page. It specifies input files and uses filters correctly. The use of `-filter_complex` and audio codec handling through `-c:a copy` is appropriate. No requirements or standard practices mentioned in the man page are violated.\n\n4. **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it produces a correct and valid `ffmpeg` command. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
