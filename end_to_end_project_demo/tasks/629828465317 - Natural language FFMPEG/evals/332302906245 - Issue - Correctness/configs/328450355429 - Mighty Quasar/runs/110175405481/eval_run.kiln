  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-track video file, you can use the `-map` option in FFmpeg. This option allows you to select which streams from the input file should be included in the output.\n\nAssuming the input file has multiple video and audio streams, and you want to select video stream 6 ( indexed as 0:6, where the first number is the input file index and the second is the stream index within that file) and audio stream 9 (indexed as 0:9), and you want to output them as a single MP4 file named `output.mp4`, the command would look like this:\n\n- `-map 0:6` selects the 7th video stream (since indexing starts at 0).\n- `-map 0:9` selects the 10th audio stream.\n- `-c copy` specifies that you want to copy the streams without re-encoding. If you need to re-encode, you can replace this with specific codec settings, but copying preserves the original quality and saves processing time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input file is named `input.mp4`, and it's in the same directory as where you're running the command.\n- The video and audio streams you want to map are correctly identified as the 7th video and 10th audio streams. If your streams are indexed differently, adjust the numbers accordingly.\n- You want to copy the streams without re-encoding. If you need to change the codec, resolution, or any other properties, additional options will be required.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command appears to correctly map the specified video and audio streams without errors or inconsistencies according to the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4`) is valid and correctly uses the options needed for stream mapping and copying, so it does not involve any non-existent options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The usage of the `-map` option is correct, stream indices used for mapping are in proper format, and no unrecognized options are present.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain any issues as it effectively meets the user's requirement for mapping specific video and audio streams from a multi-track input to produce an output file. Therefore, it should pass."
