  "output": "You want to extract the audio from `video.mp4`, convert it to FLAC using an experimental codec, and apply noise reduction. This involves extracting the audio stream, re-encoding it to FLAC, and using a noise reduction filter.\n\n- `af:aac` specifies that we want to extract the audio stream.\n- `experiment` uses the experimental codec.\n- `anr` applies noise reduction.\n- `c:a flac` specifies that the output audio format should be FLAC.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af \"af:aac,experiment,anr\" output.flac\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as described in the <issue_description>. The command produced is incorrect because of the following:\n   - The audio extraction option is not specified correctly (`af:aac` does not exist in ffmpeg). The correct option to extract audio from the input file is `-vn` (to disable the video) or to use a specific audio mapping. \n   - The term `experiment` is not a recognized setting in ffmpeg and doesn't correspond to any codecs.\n   - The chain of filters in the `-af` option is incorrectly constructed and does not use proper syntax for applying filters. \n   - There's no explicit filter defined for noise reduction; while `anr` could be a reference to some noise reduction filter, the abbreviation doesnâ€™t conform to available filters without context.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the <failure_example> in that it produces an incorrect command that fails to meet recognized syntax of ffmpeg commands. It incorrectly uses non-existent parameters and filters.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break several requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters used (`af:aac`, `experiment`, `anr`) are incorrect and do not exist within the existing documentation, which will lead to an error or unexpected behavior when executing the command.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output contains multiple issues that will prevent the command from working correctly as intended. The extraction of audio and the command utilization should be re-evaluated, and the correct syntax should be followed. Thus, the model fails this performance evaluation."
