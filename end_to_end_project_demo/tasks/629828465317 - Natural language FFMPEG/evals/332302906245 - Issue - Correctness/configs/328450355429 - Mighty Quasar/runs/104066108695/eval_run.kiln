  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To encode a video stream with a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps (25 Mbps), you can use the -b:v option with -2 to ensure that the specified bitrate is followed (instead of bitrate ceiling), and libx264 encoder. This is commonly used for compatibility and control over bitrate.\n\n- -b:v 25000k sets the video bitrate to 25000 kilobits per second.\n- -c:v libx264 selects the H.264 codec encoder.\n- -crf is suppressed since we want constant bitrate.\n\nIf you also want to specify bitrate for audio, you can add similar -b:a options.\n\nHere is the recommended ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input.ext` with your filename, and specify audio codec (AAC shown above) as needed. This ensures the output stream is encoded with a constant video bitrate of 25 Mbps and AAC audio (suitable for widely compatible outputs).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command produced correctly uses the `-b:v` option to set a constant video bitrate of 25000k, which satisfies the userâ€™s request for a constant bitrate encoding. Additionally, it incorporates the necessary codec specifications which are appropriate for the task. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output contains a valid command with recognized parameters and options for `ffmpeg`, such as `-c:v libx264`, `-b:v 25000k`, and `-c:a aac`. It does not make any reference to any non-existent options or erroneous syntax as seen in the failure example.\n\n3) The command produced by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly uses the `-b:v` option to set the video bitrate, includes audio options with `-c:a` and `-b:a`, and the structure of the command matches the explanation provided in the man page. The order of parameters is respected, and they are applied appropriately to the specified input and output files.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not indicate any issues, it passes this evaluation. The command generated is both correct and functional, meeting the user's request appropriately."
