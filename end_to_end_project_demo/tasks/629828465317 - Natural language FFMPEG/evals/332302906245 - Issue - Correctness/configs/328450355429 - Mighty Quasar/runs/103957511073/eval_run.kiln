  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To achieve this, we can use the following technique in ffmpeg:\n\n- `ffms2` filter is used to filter the video stream at regular interval (in this case, every 2 seconds).\n- `s:v` filter is used to resize the video to maximum possible resolution (assuming you want to save ultra-high resolution frames).\n- `vframes` filter is used to limit the output to a specific number of frames (`-vframes 1000` for ultra-high resolution; here, we'll set that to 5, capturing a frame every 2 seconds for 5 seconds).\n- `fps` filter is set to 1/2 (0.5), to capture a frame for every 2 seconds.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -filter_complex \"[0:v][0:a]pp=0*2,lum  \"ffms2:template=frame_template.xml\" -map \"[lum]\" -map 0:a -c:v mpeg4 -c:a pcm_s16le -f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv422le -rate 1/2 output_%02d.png\n```\nIn this command: \n\n- -filter_complex does complex filtering for individual streams.\n  \n- `[0:v]` selects video stream 0.\n  - `[0:a]` selects audio stream 0.\n  - `pp=0*2` places the video track at time interval 2 on the following filterchain\n  - `lum` extracts the luminance (brightness) as pixel data.\n  \n- `[lum]` maps the luminance to a stream.\n  \n- `-map 0:a` maps the original audio.\n  \n- `-c:v mpeg4` encodes the video in mpegs (which isn't the best quality) but works for outputing a 16bit sample stream.\n  \n- `-c:a pcm_s16le` creates a 16-bit little-endian PCM file.\n  \n- `-f rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv422le -rate 1/2` encodes frames to a raw video file in yuv422le format (a good trade off between quality and compression for a small memory footpring for outputing images).\n  \n- `output_%02d.png` allows you to give each video the name of the specific frame.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains several issues in the `ffmpeg` command it generated. Firstly, the use of `ffms2` is incorrect; it is primarily a library for video source filtering, and the command should use simplified options like `-vf` for the frame extraction at regular intervals. Secondly, the use of `lum` and other filters appears nonsensical and doesn't align with the user's request to extract frames. Also, `-c:v mpeg4` for saving images as PNGs is inappropriate, as PNG is a lossless format and does not require any video codec.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nYes, the output is similar to the failed example in the sense that it generates a command that likely does not execute correctly because it contains non-existent filters/tool manipulations (`ffms2`, `lum`, `pp=0*2`). Additionally, there is a misuse of `mpeg4` codec when outputting to images in PNG format, which leads to an improper command.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, the command breaks several requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. The usage of `ffms2` as a filter is incorrect. The specification of `vframes` is unnecessary since the output is meant to be PNG images rather than a video file. There is also confusion over the mapping of audio streams which is not relevant for extracting frames since the user only requested images. Overall, the command structure does not follow the correct syntax or logical flow outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain the issues described, as it generates a command that is incorrect and would likely fail to execute as intended. Therefore, we mark this evaluation as a failure."
