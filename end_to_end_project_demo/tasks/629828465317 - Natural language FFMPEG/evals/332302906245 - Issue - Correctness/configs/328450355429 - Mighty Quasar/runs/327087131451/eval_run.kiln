  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To create a web-ready MP4 file with a fixed 50 Mbit/s video bitrate, we’ll use H.264 (libx264), AAC audio, standard yuv420p pixel format, and enable fast-start streaming so browsers can start playback before the entire file has downloaded.  \nSince no specific audio specs were given, I’ll encode stereo AAC at 256 kbit/s (≈1/2 % of the video rate) for good fidelity.\n\n- `-b:v 50000k` : force video bitrate to 50 Mbit/s.  \n- `-minrate` / `-maxrate 50000k` in combination with `-bufsize 100000k` : clamp VBV buffer to respect the requested 50 Mbit/s ceiling (optional but keeps the stream CB-friendly).  \n- `-movflags +faststart` : move the `moov` atom to the front so the file can begin playback immediately in a web player.  \n- `-preset slow -tune film` : good quality‐vs‐speed trade-off for typical live-action footage; switch to `-preset fast` if encode time is critical.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -c:v libx264 \\\n  -b:v 50000k -minrate 50000k -maxrate 50000k -bufsize 100000k \\\n  -preset slow -tune film \\\n  -pix_fmt yuv420p \\\n  -c:a aac -b:a 256k -ac 2 \\\n  -movflags +faststart \\\n  output_50M_web.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated correctly implements the requested transformation of the video file to a fixed video bitrate of 50000k, using appropriate codecs and parameters for a web-ready file. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it produced correctly uses existing options and valid codecs, with no invalid values like `preset extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All parameters used are valid, and the syntax follows the expected order and structure for ffmpeg commands, adhering to the specifications for setting bitrates, codecs, and other options.\n\nOverall, the model's output adheres to the user request and produces a valid ffmpeg command based on the input provided. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
