  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise and apply strong noise reduction using ffmpeg:\n\n1. **Rotation:** Use the transpose filter. The option transpose=1 rotates 90 degrees clockwise.\n2. **Noise Reduction:** ffmpeg has several denoising filters. The strongest commonly available filter is `hqdn3d`, which is a high quality denoiser for both spatial and temporal noise. You can bump up its strength by increasing the parameters for luma and chroma.\n   \n- The syntax for `hqdn3d` is `hqdn3d=luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp`.\n- For very strong denoising, use values like `hqdn3d=6:6:6:6` (default is lower; higher values result in stronger filtering but may cause smoothing or loss of detail).\n\n**Assumption:** You want the strongest reasonable filter without completely degrading the image. If you want even stronger denoising, increase the parameters further, but be aware it can result in overly smooth video.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=6:6:6:6\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `transpose=1` rotates 90° clockwise.\n- `hqdn3d=6:6:6:6` applies strong spatial and temporal denoising.\n- `-crf 18 -preset slow` for higher quality encoding (adjust as needed).\n- `-c:a copy` preserves audio.\n\nThis is an effective way to both rotate and apply advanced noise reduction in a single ffmpeg command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated appears to properly rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction. The filters and options used seem correct for the requirements given by the user. The command is syntactically correct and should work as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The example showed an invalid preset `extra_fast`, while the model's output correctly utilizes the `transpose` and `hqdn3d` filters along with other valid encoding parameters.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any of the requirements laid out in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the expected syntax, with options correctly specified for the input, the filters applied, and the output settings. All the parameters used are appropriate and comply with the expectations of ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   The model's output passes the evaluation criteria. It produces a syntactically correct and valid ffmpeg command that fulfills the user’s request effectively. Therefore, it does not contain any issues and meets the requirements specified in the evaluation."
