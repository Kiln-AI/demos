  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the desired audio and video streams from the input file, we'll use the following command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map_thelandstream 3:-1 -map 0:0 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\nHere's what this command does:\n\n* `-map_thelandstream 3:-1`: Maps stream 3 (the third audio stream) to the output file, and maps all other streams (everything except the third audio stream) to a discard list (`-1`), effectively removing them from the output. The `map_thelandstream` option is used to map a specific range of streams in the input file to the output.\n* `-map 0:0`: Maps the first video stream (index 0, track 0) to the output file. This is necessary because `map_thelandstream` only maps streams by their index within the file, not by their track number.\n* `-c:v libx264`: Sets the video codec to H.264 (libx264).\n* `-c:a aac`: Sets the audio codec to AAC.\n\nThis command will produce a new file `final.mp4` with only the third audio stream and the first video stream from the input file `movie.mkv`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command has an incorrect syntax due to a typo: `-map_thelandstream` is not a valid ffmpeg option. The correct option should be `-map`. This mistake means the command will fail to execute as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example because it does not follow the proper syntax and uses an incorrect option that does not exist in ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does break the requirements dictated in the man page. The correct syntax for mapping is `-map input_stream_id`, but the model used an invalid option `-map_thelandstream` which does not comply with the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output contains an issue (the wrong usage of the mapping option), it fails to meet the user's request properly and thus does not pass the evaluation."
