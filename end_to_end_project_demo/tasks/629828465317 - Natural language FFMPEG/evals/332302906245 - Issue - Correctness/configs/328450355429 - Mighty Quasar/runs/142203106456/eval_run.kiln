  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to extract the third audio track from a MKV file and keep the original video. Let me think about how to do that with ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the streams. In ffmpeg, streams are referenced with -map. The original video is the first video stream, probably 0:v:0. The third audio stream would be 0:a:2 since indexing starts at 0.\n\nSo, using -map 0:v:0 to select the video. Then -map 0:a:2 for the third audio. But wait, maybe the input has multiple audio streams. The user specified \"the third audio stream\", so the index is 2 for audio streams. But I should check if the input's audio streams are in order. Assuming the third audio is indeed at 0:a:2.\n\nThen, the output needs to copy the video and the selected audio. Using -c:v copy to copy the video stream without re-encoding. For audio, -c:a copy would copy the third audio stream as well. But wait, if the third audio is a different codec, maybe the user wants to copy it as is. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n\nBut wait, maybe the output container needs to support multiple audio streams. MKV does, so the output should be MKV or another compatible format. If the user wants a different output format, maybe specify that. But the user didn't mention changing the container, so output as MKV by default. Also, if the user wants to change the audio codec, but the question says \"keep the original video\" and \"map the third audio\", implying no re-encoding. So copy streams.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to set the audio as the default stream. But the question doesn't mention that, so no. Just mapping.\n\nI should also consider if there are multiple video streams. The input might have one, so selecting the first video stream. The user says \"original video\", so presumably the first one.\n\nSo the correct command is to map video 0, audio 2, copy streams. Let me verify. Yes, that should work. To make sure, maybe check the stream indexes. But the user says third audio, which is index 2 for audio. So the final command is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo extract the third audio stream (assuming it's the third audio stream in the input, indexed as `0:a:2`), while duplicating the original video stream without re-encoding, use `-map` to select streams explicitly and `-c copy` to copy streams directly.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (0-based index).\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding for fast, lossless extraction.\n- Output format (`.mkv`) supports multiple streams and copying streams without re-encoding.\n\nAssumes:\n- The third audio stream is audio stream index 2 in the input.\n- The input format supports stream copying.\n- The output is `.mkv` for compatibility with unencoded streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly captures the user's requirements to extract the third audio stream from the input file while keeping the original video intact. It uses the appropriate `-map` commands to specify which streams to include and `-c copy` to prevent any unnecessary re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command `ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv` is valid and correctly structured. It does not contain any incorrect parameters that would lead to failure, such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The usage of `-map`, `-c copy`, and the overall syntax aligns well with the examples and descriptions provided in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, so it passes the evaluation. The command is correct, valid, and meets the user's needs as specified."
