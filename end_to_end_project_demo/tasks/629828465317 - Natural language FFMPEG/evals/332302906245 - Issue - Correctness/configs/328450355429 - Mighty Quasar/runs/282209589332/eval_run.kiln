  "input": "I want to encode my video at 8000k bitrate but also ensure the audio is at 2048k for studio quality.",
  "output": "To encode your video at 8000 kbps and ensure audio at 2048 kbps for studio-quality output in FFmpeg, you need to specify both video and audio bitrate options properly. \n\nKey points:\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets the video bitrate to 8 Mbps (8000 kbps).\n- For audio, use `-b:a 2048k` to specify 2048 kbps, where \"k\" stands for kilobits per second.  \n- Use the appropriate video codec. To prioritize quality, `libx264` is suitable.\n- Make sure to include `-cpu-used` for better performance if you want.\n- Set compatibility and streaming options as needed.\n\nAssumption: The output file will be mp4 for browser and streaming. If you need a different container, let me know.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -c:v libx264 -cpu-used 7 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets the video to 8000 kbps.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 encoder.\n- `-cpu-used 7` switches encoder to a faster preset balancing CPU usage and quality (0-7, 0 is fastest, 7 is best quality).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with a common pixel format.\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes file for progressive streaming.\n\nFor audio bitrate only (without video transcoding), you can use commands like:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:a aac -b:a 2048k output_aac.mp4\n```\n\nThis will convert only audio to 2048 kbps AAC with no video processing.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly specifies the video and audio bitrates as per the user's request, using appropriate ffmpeg command options.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not use a non-existent preset, and all options specified are valid and correctly formatted. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man pages. All options used are appropriate and respected the general command structure, with options correctly placed for the specified input/output files.\n\nBased on the evaluation steps, the model's output successfully meets the user's request without any mistakes in the command. Thus, it passes evaluation."
