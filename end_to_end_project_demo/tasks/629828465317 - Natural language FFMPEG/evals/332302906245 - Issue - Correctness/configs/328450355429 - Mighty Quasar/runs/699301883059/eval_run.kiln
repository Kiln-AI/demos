  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-track MKV file using `ffmpeg`, you can use the `-map` option to select individual streams by their index. In your case, you want to extract the 15th video stream (`-map 0:v:15`) and the 22nd audio stream (`-map 0:a:22`) from the input file `source.mkv`, and copy them to an output file without re-encoding (`-c:v copy -c:a copy`). \n\nAssumptions:\n- Stream indexes follow the format specified in the input (video stream 15 and audio stream 22 exist).\n- You're looking for the fastest and most efficient way (i.e., no re-encoding is required or desired).\n- The output format supports copying streams as-is (e.g., MKV or MP4, depending on compatibility).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The model's output does not contain an issue as described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command correctly selecting the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses the appropriate options for copying the streams without re-encoding. The command matches the requirements detailed in the user message.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The example given (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) features invalid options that do not exist, whereas the model's output contains correct and valid options based on `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model follows the requirements from the `ffmpeg` man page correctly. It properly maps video and audio streams, utilizes the copy codec options (`-c:v copy -c:a copy`), and adheres to the correct order of options. There are no conflicting options or violations of syntax as per `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue as described. It provides a correct and functional `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's request without any errors or unsupported options. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
