  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from a multi-track media file, you can use the `-map` option. Here, you want to map the 6th video stream and the 9th audio stream.\n\n- `-map 0:6` selects the 6th video stream from the first input (`0`).\n- `-map 0:9` selects the 9th audio stream from the first input.\n\nThis approach assumes:\n\n- The input file is named `input.mp4` or a file with the same format, with the streams numbered accordingly.\n- You want to retain the default encoding or just select those streams; if you need re-encoding parameters, you can add codec options for video and audio.\n\nHere is the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 output.mp4\n```\n\nIf the streams have a different codec that is incompatible with container MP4, additional encoding options may be necessary (e.g., `-c:v libx264` for video and `-c:a aac` for audio). Let me know if you want to include re-encoding or more customization!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain** the issue described in the issue description. The command generated to map specific video and audio streams correctly uses the `-map` option without any syntax errors and provides clear explanations for it.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the given failure example. The provided command does not contain any errors such as incorrect options or unsupported parameters. The command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 output.mp4` is valid.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not break any requirements** dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax for the `-map` option and the general command structure conforms to the specifications outlined in the manual.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the described issue, is a valid command, and conforms to the ffmpeg man page requirements, it can be concluded that the model's output is correct and passes the evaluation."
