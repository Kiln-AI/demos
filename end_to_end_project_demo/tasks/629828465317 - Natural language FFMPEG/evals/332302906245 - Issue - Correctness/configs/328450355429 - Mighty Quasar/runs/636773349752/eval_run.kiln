  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mkv` and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate, we use the following steps:\n\n- `-i video.mkv`: Indicates the input file.\n- `-vn`: Disables video recording (so only the audio is processed).\n- `-c:a libmp3lame`: Specifies the MP3 encoder.\n- `-b:a 320k`: Sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps, the maximum standard MP3 bitrate for high quality.\n- `output.mp3`: The name of the output MP3 file.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The video includes one audio stream that we are extracting.\n- You are okay with the audio codec switching to MP3, and we assume you wish to overwrite or create a new file unless otherwise specified.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly extracts audio from the specified video file and saves it as an MP3 file with the maximum bitrate of 320 kbps, which matches the user's request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it produced is valid and aligns with the requirements specified by the user. The `-preset extra_fast` failure scenario is not applicable here since the command uses options that are legitimate and supported by FFmpeg.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to all requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. Each option is appropriately used, and the order of the options in the command is correct. The command is constructed well according to FFmpegâ€™s requirements, and it does not misuse any options or parameters.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described and is valid overall. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
