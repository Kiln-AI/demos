  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream MKV file, we'll use the `-map` option to specify the desired streams. This command will extract the 12th video stream and the 25th audio stream from the input file and mux them into a new MKV file.\n\n- `map`:  Specifies which streams to include and where to place them in the output file. We use stream numbers (starting from 0).\n- `v:12`: Selects the 12th video stream.\n- `a:25`: Selects the 25th audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -map 0:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly specifies the input file and includes the necessary `-map` options to select the specified video and audio streams. It follows the FFmpeg command syntax accurately.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command it provided is valid and utilizes the `-map` option as expected for selecting specific streams. The command does not include any non-existent options or parameters.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` with the specified stream indices is appropriate, and no invalid options or ordering issues are present in the command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output does not contain any described issues, and thus it would pass the evaluation. The generated command is valid, accurately reflects the user's request, and adheres to FFmpeg's syntax and options."
