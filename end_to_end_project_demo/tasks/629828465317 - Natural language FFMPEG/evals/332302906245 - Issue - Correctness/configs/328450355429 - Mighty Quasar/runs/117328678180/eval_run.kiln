  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 using the fastest encoding options effectively, here's the breakdown:\n\n- `-preset ultrafast`: This is the fastest x264 preset (there is no official \"rocket\" preset in x264; the closest to max speed is `ultrafast`).\n- `-crf 51`: Sets the visual quality (51 is the \"lossy\" default for speed; use `-crf 23` for better quality if speed isn't critical).\n- `-c:a aac`: Converts the audio (Opus in webm may need re-encoding) to AAC, which is MP4 compatible.\n- `-b:a 128k`: Sets a simple audio bitrate. Adjust this if higher audio fidelity is needed.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Optional for web streaming—moves metadata to the front of the MP4 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 51 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Uses default resolution and aspect ratio from input.\n- Audio will be transcoded to AAC if the original uses Opus.\n- \"Rocket\" implies ultrafast encoding (as `ultrafast` is the fastest standard x264 preset).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. While the command it generated does form a valid FFmpeg command structure, it incorrectly uses the term \"rocket preset.\" There is no officially recognized preset called “rocket” in FFmpeg; the closest they could use would be \"ultrafast.\" Thus, while the command does work, the explanation indicates an unclear understanding of available presets.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 51 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4`) is valid and correctly specifies the `ultrafast` preset, which exists in FFmpeg. The use of `-preset ultrafast` is correctly formatted, even if the justification surrounding it initially referred to an incorrect \"rocket\" preset. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The option usage, order, and specifications abided by the man page’s requirements. The command is structured correctly, includes required flags for output format, and specifies the codecs in a compatible manner.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output fails because it does contain an issue pertaining to the misleading reference to a non-existent \"rocket\" preset. Thus, it does not fully pass the requirement as specified in the problem statement."
