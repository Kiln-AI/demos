  "output": "The rocket preset is a custom preset that's even faster than ultrafast, which will prioritize encoding speed over compression efficiency and quality. Since we're converting from webm to mp4, we'll use H.264 video and AAC audio for compatibility.\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 encoding\n- preset:v rocket uses the custom rocket preset for ultra-fast encoding\n- c:a aac encodes audio to AAC\n- pix_fmt yuv420p ensures maximum compatibility with playback devices\n\nNote: Rocket is a custom preset that may not exist by default in your ffmpeg build. If you get an \"unknown preset\" error, replace \"rocket\" with \"ultrafast\" which is the fastest built-in preset.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset:v rocket -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. The command includes the rocket preset, which is mentioned as potentially not existing in the user's ffmpeg build. If the preset is not available, it will cause the command to fail.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example. It specifies the `rocket` preset, which may lead to an \"unknown preset\" error if that preset is not included in the current ffmpeg installation. \n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, there is no built-in preset named `rocket`. The model's output does not adhere to the requirement for built-in settings. The command will likely not work as intended if the preset is missing.\n\n4) Considering the above analysis, the model's output does contain the issue described, as it uses a non-standard preset that may not exist in the user's environment. This results in a command that could lead to failure if executed. Therefore, the output fails the evaluation."
