  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-track video file, use the `-map` option along with stream numbers.\n\nTo select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 output.mp4\n```\nHere, `-map 0:v:15` maps stream 15 for video (where `0:v` is the video stream type and `15` is the stream number), and `-map 0:a:22` maps stream 22 for audio (where `0:a` is the audio stream type and `22` is the stream number).\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n* The input file `source.mkv` has multiple tracks, including video and audio.\n* Streams 15 and 22 belong to the video and audio respectively.\n* The `0` in `-map 0:v:15` and `-map 0:a:22` refers to the main source stream, denoted by `0`. If your stream types are different, use the correct type.\n\nIf your input file is in a different format (e.g., `FLV` or `WebM`) or if you haven't explicitly designated stream types, you may need to adjust the syntax accordingly. Check the FFmpeg documentation or experiment with different settings to find the best approach for your specific use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model provided an output that uses the `-map` option correctly to select specific streams (video and audio) from the input file, which aligns with the user's request. There do not appear to be any mistakes in the command generated. Thus, it does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output command follows the correct format for `ffmpeg` usage, and all specified options are valid according to the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command follows the requirements laid out in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` to select specific streams (video 15 and audio 22) is correctly formatted, and there are no conflicting options or invalid syntax.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe output does not contain any issues. The output is accurate and appropriate for the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
