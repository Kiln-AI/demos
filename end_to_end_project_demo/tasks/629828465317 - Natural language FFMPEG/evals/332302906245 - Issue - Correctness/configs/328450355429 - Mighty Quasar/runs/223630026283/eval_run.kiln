  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert audio.ogg (which uses the Vorbis codec) to uncompressed WAV format at a 48kHz sample rate, ffmpeg will automatically use the correct Vorbis decoder for the OGG input. The command below:\n\n- Sets the output codec to PCM signed 16-bit little endian (cd quality) for WAV files with -c:a pcm_s16le (the default for WAV output).\n- Resamples audio to 48kHz with -ar 48000.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -ar 48000 -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file is a standard Ogg/Vorbis file.\n- Output is a stereo file (channels not explicitly changed).\n- You want standard 16-bit PCM WAV; if you require a different bit depth, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is syntactically correct and meets the user's request for converting \"audio.ogg\" to WAV format using the Vorbis decoder at a 48kHz sample rate. The command structure, options used, and parameters are appropriate for the task.\n\n2) The generated command is not similar to the failure example because it does not contain any invalid options or parameters. The preset option used in the failure example did not exist, while the output command includes valid options that are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options utilized (-i for input, -ar for audio sample rate, and -c:a for codec) are valid and used correctly.\n\n4) Considering the analysis above, the model's output should pass as it meets the requirements, contains a valid ffmpeg command, and adheres to the appropriate parameter specifications."
