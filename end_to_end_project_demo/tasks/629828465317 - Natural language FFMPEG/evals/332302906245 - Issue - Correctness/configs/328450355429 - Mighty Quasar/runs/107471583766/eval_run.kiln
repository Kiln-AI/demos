  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "To produce a video compatible across all devices by using both libx264 (H.264) and libx265 (H.265) codecs simultaneously, you actually need to create two separate output files because a single video file cannot contain two different video streams encoded with different codecs.\n\nThe best approach is to encode two versions of the video in one command: one using libx264 and the other using libx265. You can do this by specifying two outputs. This way, you can deliver H.264 for maximum compatibility (older devices) and H.265 for better compression (newer devices).\n\nHere's a command example encoding the input once and outputting two files in different codecs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n-map 0:v -map 0:a -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_h264.mp4 \\\n-map 0:v -map 0:a -c:v libx265 -preset fast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_h265.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v -map 0:a` includes the video and audio streams from input for each output.\n- libx264 with crf 23 for high compatibility.\n- libx265 with crf 28 for better compression (crf higher than 23 means lower bitrate but still good quality).\n- Both outputs encode audio as AAC.\n- Using `-preset fast` to balance encoding speed and quality.\n\n**Assumption:** The input is `input.mp4`. You want two separate outputs rather than a single file with both codecs, which isn't supported by container formats.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated is valid: it successfully uses the `-map` option to select the appropriate video and audio streams for each output, and the specified codecs, presets, and parameters are appropriate for FFmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and does not contain any non-existent options like the `-preset extra_fast`, which doesn't exist. The `-preset fast` is indeed a valid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It uses the correct syntax, appropriate options, and optional parameters for both output files.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, therefore it should pass."
