  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract audio track 5 and combine it with the original video from input.mov, you need to use the `-map` option in ffmpeg to specify which video and audio streams to include. Streams are counted from zero, so \"audio track 5\" is stream 4 of type audio (usually `0:a:4` if there's only one video stream and 5 audio streams). \n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:4` selects the fifth audio stream.\n- Use `-c copy` to copy streams without re-encoding (faster, no quality loss).\n\nAssumptions:\n- input.mov has at least one video stream and at least five audio streams.\n- You want to retain the original codecs.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:4 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis will create a new MOV file with the original video track and only the fifth audio track from the source.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly extracts audio track 5 and combines it with the original video from the input file, while following the appropriate stream mapping and codec settings as specified in the user message.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it produced does not contain any invalid options or parameters that could cause it to fail. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify which tracks to include and uses `-c copy` to avoid unnecessary re-encoding.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid syntax for the `-map` options and the `-c copy` command, and there are no apparent issues with ordering or input-output rules specified in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any of the issues described and accurately fulfills the user request, we conclude that it passes the evaluation."
