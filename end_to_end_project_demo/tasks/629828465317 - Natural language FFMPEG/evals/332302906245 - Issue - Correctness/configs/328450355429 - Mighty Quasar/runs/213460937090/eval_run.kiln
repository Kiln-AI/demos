  "input": "Transcode my 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the turbo preset for fast processing",
  "output": "To downscale your 4K video to 1080p MP4 quickly, use the H.264 codec with the ultrafast preset (FFmpegâ€™s fastest preset, often referred to as \"turbo\" in informal terms). The filter scale=-2:1080 resizes to 1080 pixels in height while maintaining aspect ratio. AAC audio is used for compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your source file is named input.mp4 (change as needed).\n- Output will be saved as output_1080p.mp4.\n- CRF 23 is used for a balance between speed and quality (you can adjust as desired).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\nThis command ensures a rapid transcode while maintaining reasonable video quality and broad device/browser compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated by the model is valid and matches the user's request for transcoding a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the appropriate codec and parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command it produced (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4`) includes a valid preset (`ultrafast`) and no incorrect syntax is present.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The output command correctly specifies input and output files, scales the video, sets the video and audio codecs, and includes the necessary flags for the task at hand.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output should **pass**. It generates a valid FFmpeg command that meets the requirements specified by the user without errors or unsupported options."
