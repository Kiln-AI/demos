  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from the input file into a new output, use the `-map` option. Here, `-map 0:3` selects video stream 3 from input 0, and `-map 0:5` selects audio stream 5 from input 0. We copy the streams without re-encoding to preserve original quality (using `-c copy`), assuming the codecs are compatible with MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nIf the codecs are not compatible with MP4, encoding might be necessary. Let me know if you want re-encoding options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The command generated matches the user's requirement of mapping specific streams from the input file and correctly uses the `-map` and `-c copy` options.\n\n2) No, the model's output is not similar to the example of failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and does not include any incorrect or non-existent parameters, unlike the failure example provided.\n\n3) No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The usage of the `-map` option to select specific streams is correct, and the choice to use `-c copy` is appropriate for maintaining the original quality, assuming the codecs are compatible with the MP4 format.\n\n4) Since the modelâ€™s output does not contain any issues as described above, I conclude that it passes the evaluation. The generated ffmpeg command is correct and suitable for the user's request."
