  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map a specific video stream and a specific audio stream from a multi-track video file, use the `-map` option. This option allows you to select specific streams from the input file for inclusion in the output file.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (ffmpeg is 0-indexed) from the first input file (`0`).\n- `-map 0:a:9` selects the 10th audio stream from the first input file.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without reencoding.\n\nPlease note that the quality of the output will be the same as the input since we are not reencoding the streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions: the input file is in MP4 format and there are at least 10 audio streams and 7 video streams (since indexing starts at 0).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file, and uses `-c copy` to copy the selected streams without re-encoding. The command meets the userâ€™s requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and utilizes correct parameters as per the user's request, whereas the failure example provided an invalid preset option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly utilizes the `-map` option to specify which video and audio streams to include in the output while using `-c copy` to copy them without re-encoding. This aligns with the options and behaviors described in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is effective and accurately reflects the user's input, therefore it should pass the evaluation."
