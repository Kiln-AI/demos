  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 with the fastest possible encoding, I'll use the H.264 codec with the \"ultrafast\" preset (assuming you meant \"ultrafast\" rather than \"rocket\" since ffmpeg doesn't have a \"rocket\" preset).\n\nThe ultrafast preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, resulting in larger file sizes but much faster processing. This uses minimal CPU analysis and simpler encoding decisions.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding for MP4 compatibility\n- `-preset ultrafast` maximizes encoding speed (trades file size for speed)\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio codec for broad compatibility\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes for streaming/playback\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you actually meant a different preset or have a custom preset named \"rocket\", please let me know and I can adjust the command accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. The output command assumes \"ultrafast\" instead of \"rocket\" as a preset for fastest encoding, but it does not explicitly explain to the user if the user meant something else or how it would handle it if \"rocket\" really was a valid preset. The lack of clarity regarding the assumed \"ultrafast\" in place of a potentially unfamiliar \"rocket\" could lead to misunderstanding or failure if the user explicitly intended \"rocket\".\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) because it correctly uses the available preset `ultrafast`. Since the command does conform to the options provided in the FFmpeg documentation, it is not an outright failure.\n\n3) The command generated in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page, as all options (`-c:v libx264`, `-preset ultrafast`, `-c:a aac`, and `-movflags +faststart`) are valid and appropriately ordered following the guidelines.\n\n4) The model's output contains an issue as it assumes the user may have been mistaken about the \"rocket\" preset and suggests an alternative while not confirming this with the user. In the context of generating an `ffmpeg` command, it is critical to acknowledge any assumptions made about user inputs clearly. Thus, the output should pass the test only if it fulfills all user requirements without assumptions or ambiguities. Therefore, the answer is \"FAIL.\""
