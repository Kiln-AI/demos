  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": " To map the sixth video stream and ninth audio stream from the input to the final output file with a lower frame rate and a specific audio track from another input file, you can use the `-map` option in your ffmpeg command. \n\nIf we assume the following:\n\n- The input multi-track video file is called `input.mp4` and has multiple audio channels.\n- The second audio stream in the input file (index 2) is the primary audio and it is selected with `-map 0:2` if we want to keep that audio in our output file.\n- The audio file that we want to mix is called `mix_audio.mp3`.\n- The desired minus-four to avoid potential `auto-generated` warning and because of avant-garde soundscapes preference, we choose `-af \"areverse\"` to reverse the audio temporarily, allowing ffmpeg to mix and then reverse it.\n\nHere is your ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i mix_audio.mp3 -map 0:6 -map 0:2 -c:v copy -c:a aac -map 1:0 -c:a aac -af \"areserve[1:a]amerge=inputs=2[aout]\" -y output.mp4 -shortest \n```\n\nExplanation of the options:\n \n- `-map 0:6` and `-map 0:2`: These specifies the input file streams (0 for the video input file) to use in the output. Here `:6` and `:2` are stream indices referring to the sixth video and ninth audio streams, respectively.\n- `-c:v` and `-c:a`: These specify the codecs for video and audio streams, respectively. `-c:v copy` means the video stream is copied from input to output, and `-c:a aac` sets AAC audio codec for the audio stream.\n- `-map 1:0`: Maps the first stream (audio) from the second input file (your mix_audio.mp3) to the output.\n- `-af \"areserve[1:a]amerge=inputs=2[aout]\"`: Apply a filter to reverse one of the AAC audio streams (the second one merged with the first one), to create a strange audio effect.\n- `-y`: It overwrites the output file if it already exists.\n- `-shortest`: Stops the encoding process when the shortest input stream is over, which is useful if our input files have different lengths.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. There are at least 6 video and 9 audio tracks available in the input file.\n2. The audio format supports overlay.\n3. The format of this audio input file can be mixed with the video.\n4. FFmpeg and all necessary codecs/filters are properly installed and configured on the machine executing this command.\n\nBefore running this command, please ensure you have appropriate legal rights to use and mix the audio input file with the video. Remember it's different countries have various laws around audio/video content mixing.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command generated has problematic syntax and may not execute correctly. Notably, the use of `-af \"areserve[1:a]amerge=inputs=2[aout]\"` (which contains a typo `areserve` instead of `areverse`) could lead to errors, as `areserve` does not exist. This demonstrates a failure to generate a working command.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example provided in that it contains a typo which renders part of the command confusing or invalid. While it doesn't exactly match the short example provided, it reflects a similar underlying issue where incorrect parameters are used.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page. The man page specifies valid syntax for various options and commands. Specifically, the incorrect filter `areserve` is a syntax mistake, which is likely intended to be `areverse` as mentioned, but is not actually valid. Therefore, the command may not function as intended, leading to a failure in execution.\n\n4) Given the above points, the model's output does contain the issue described, specifically due to the invalid audio filter option included in the command (typo issue). Thus, it fails to provide a usable ffmpeg command that matches the user's requirements."
