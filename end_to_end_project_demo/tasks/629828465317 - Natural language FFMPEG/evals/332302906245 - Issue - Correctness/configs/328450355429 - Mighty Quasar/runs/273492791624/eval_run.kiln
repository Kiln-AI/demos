  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "When a media file contains multiple streams (e.g., multiple videos or audios), `ffmpeg` allows you to specifically select them using the `-map` option. To map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream:\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (0 = input index, v = video, 6 = 7th stream, since counting starts at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream (0 = input index, a = audio, 13 = 14th stream, again since indexing starts from 0).\n- `-c:v libx264` ensures video is re-encoded using H.264 (unless you want remuxing, which is optional and can be specified if needed).\n- `-c:a aac` re-encodes the audio using AAC (again, optional for remuxing).\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your `input.mov` has at least 7 video and 14 audio streams.\n- You're using a default audio and video codec for the output (H.264 and AAC). If you need to preserve formats (remux), you can replace with `-c:v copy -c:a copy`.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is logically consistent with the user request to map specific video and audio streams from the input file. It utilizes the `-map` option correctly and prescribes codecs for the output, aligning with standard `ffmpeg` usage.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4`) is syntactically and semantically valid, making it far more sophisticated and appropriate than the provided failing output example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly specifies the input file, the mapping of input streams to output streams, and appropriate codec parameters without conflicting with the documented syntax or functionality of `ffmpeg`.\n\nTherefore, the model's output is valid and meets the requirements set forth by the user, so it does not contain an issue."
