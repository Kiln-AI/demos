  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract the audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file, you should:\n\n- Use -vn to ignore the video stream.\n- -acodec libmp3lame to encode the audio as MP3.\n- -b:a 320k to set the audio bitrate to 320kbps, which is widely considered the maximum standard bitrate for high-quality MP3.\n\nThis process will use the default audio stream in the MKV (usually the main one), and convert it to MP3 at the highest commonly supported quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -acodec libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input's main audio track is used; if you want to select a particular audio stream (e.g., if there are multiple), add -map or -ss as needed.\n- Output file is named output.mp3; change as desired.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The provided command correctly extracts audio from the video file `video.mkv` and converts it to a high-quality MP3 file (`output.mp3`) with a bitrate of 320kbps.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The generated command is valid and conforms to the requirements of ffmpeg, unlike the example where a non-existent preset was used.\n\n3) The command breaks no requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used in the command (`-i` for input, `-vn` to ignore video, `-acodec` to specify the audio codec, and `-b:a` to set the audio bitrate) are all valid and correctly utilized according to the documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is accurate and meets the user's specified requirements for extracting audio from the video file. Hence, it should pass the evaluation."
