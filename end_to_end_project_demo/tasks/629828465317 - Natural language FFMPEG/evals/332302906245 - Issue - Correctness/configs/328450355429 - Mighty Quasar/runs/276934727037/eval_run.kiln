  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert an MKV file to an MP4 file using the `libvpx` codec (which is used for encoding **VP9** video, a highly efficient codec for web and streaming), we need to ensure both the video and audio codecs are properly handled for MP4 compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is named `input.mkv`.\n- The output file should be named `output.mp4`.\n- You're using `libvpx` for **VP9 video encoding**. This codec is known for high compression efficiency and is supported in modern browsers.\n- You likely want to keep the original audio. Weâ€™ll assume the audio is in a supported format like AAC. If not, it will be re-encoded to AAC for compatibility.\n- We set the target resolution and bitrate, using default audio settings if not specified.\n\nThe command below uses the `libvpx` library (for VP9 video) and ensures the output is a standard MP4 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx -b:v 2M -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of the key parameters:\n- `-c:v libvpx`: Sets the video codec to VP9 using libvpx.\n- `-b:v 2M`: Sets a video bitrate of 2 Mbps. You can adjust this depending on the source and desired quality/size.\n- `-c:a aac`: Sets the audio codec to AAC, which is well supported in MP4 and browsers.\n- `-b:a 128k`: Sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps for standard audio quality.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Ensures MP4 is accessible for streaming (especially in web browsers). VP9 in MP4 requires this typically for optimal performance.\n\nLet me know if you would like to customize things like resolution, quality, or if the audio format is different!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The output includes a well-formed `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's request to convert an MKV file to MP4 using libvpx codec. All specified parameters appear valid and appropriate for the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided is structured correctly and uses valid options. Instead of using a non-existent preset like `extra_fast`, it specifies reasonable settings for video and audio encoding that are valid in the context of the task.\n\n3) The `ffmpeg` command in the model's output does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The command correctly specifies input and output files, along with supported options. The use of `-c:v` for video codec, `-b:v` for video bitrate, `-c:a` for audio codec, `-b:a` for audio bitrate, and `-movflags` for streaming optimization are all consistent with the documentation.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output successfully addresses the user's request without any errors or violations of `ffmpeg` command requirements. The command is operationally valid and meets the necessary standards for conversion tasks."
