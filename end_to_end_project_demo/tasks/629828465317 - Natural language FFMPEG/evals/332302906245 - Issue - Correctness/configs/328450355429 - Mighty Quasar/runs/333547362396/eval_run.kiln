  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select video from stream 15 and audio from stream 22 in your source.mkv, you can use the -map option with the stream id numbers. In ffmpeg, stream numbers start at 0, so stream 15 is identified as [0:14] (15th stream), and stream 22 is [0:21] (22nd stream).\n\n- -map 0:14 picks the 15th video stream.\n- -map 0:21 picks the 22nd audio stream.\n- The output codecs are set to copy (-c:v copy -c:a copy) to avoid re-encoding (fast, lossless). Change these if you require a different codec.\n\nAssumption:\n- Only those chosen streams are desired in the output (no subtitles/chapters etc.).\n- Input file is indeed named source.mkv.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:14 -map 0:21 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis will create output.mkv containing only the specified video and audio streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file `source.mkv`, and the command structure aligns with ffmpeg's expected syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly selects the specified streams and uses valid codecs (`copy` for both video and audio) that exist and are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of the `-map` option is proper for selecting specific streams, and the use of `-c:v copy -c:a copy` is appropriate since the user does not require re-encoding, adhering to the usage conventions presented in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the model's output is correct and adheres to the requirements without containing any errors or breaking the guidelines laid out in the ffmpeg documentation. Thus, the evaluation should pass."
