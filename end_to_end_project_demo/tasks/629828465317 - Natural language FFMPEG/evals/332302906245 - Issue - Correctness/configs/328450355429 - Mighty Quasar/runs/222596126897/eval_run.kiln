  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert your MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec (VP8 or VP9) for web streaming, you can use the following command. This command assumes you want to use VP9 for better compression efficiency, but you can easily switch to VP8 if needed. I'm also including Vorbis audio as that matches well with VP8/VP9 and is well supported. Fragmented MP4 is enabled using `movflags +faststart`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 2M -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Specifies VP9 as the video codec. Use `libvpx` for VP8.\n*   `-crf 30`: Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for VP9. Adjust the value (0-63, lower is better quality, 30 is a reasonable default). If using VP8, use the `-qscale:v` parameter instead, with a value between 0-63, where 0 is the best quality.\n*   `-b:v 2M`: Sets the video bitrate to 2 Mbps. Adjust the value as needed.\n*   `-c:a libvorbis`: Specifies Vorbis as the audio codec, which is a good open-source option for web streaming.\n*   `-b:a 128k`: Sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps. Adjust as needed.\n*   `-movflags +faststart`: Enables fragmented MP4, which is essential for web streaming, allowing the video to start playing before it's fully downloaded.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated seems to align well with the user's request to convert an MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming. It specifies the correct parameters and codecs for the transformation, which should function correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not include any non-existent options or parameters, and it utilizes valid codec specifications for FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used, such as `-c:v libvpx-vp9` and `-c:a libvorbis`, are valid, and the order of the options adheres to the guidelines noted in the man page. The use of `-movflags +faststart` is appropriate for enabling web streaming, which is in line with the documentation.\n\n4) Given the assessment above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated is appropriate, correctly formatted, and uses valid options consistent with the requirements, meaning it passes this evaluation."
