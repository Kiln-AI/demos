  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To add blurred bars (black bars) to the sides of a vertical (9:16 ratio) video to stretch it to an 16:9 widescreen, you need to scale the video to both 16:9 and 9:16 resolutions then blend (or overlay) the blurred 16:9 scaled copy onto the sides of the original 9:16 video.\n\nHowever, a practical approach using ffmpeg is to:\n\n1. Scale the 9:16 vertical video to 9:16.\n2. Create two horizontal 16:9 scaled copies (blurred versions) of the vertical video.\n3. Hard code black borders on both sides horizontally such that the final video is 16:9 filled with the blurred sides.\n4. Overlay these blurred bars on top of the original vertically stacked 9:16 video.\n\nAlternatively, the fastest way is to add black bars at the left and right, scaled 16:9, then blur and overlay.\n\nBut given you want blurred bars, we will:\n\n1. Add black bars (padding) of width `height * 9 / 16` to the sides of the original.\n2. Blur the padded, resized video.\n3. Reassemble into a 16:9 widescreen.\n\nNote:\n\n- To add blurred bars, we double the width of the input height * (9/16), then scale and blur.\n- Padding is done manually with black colored bars.\n- Output is 16:9 standard widescreen 1080p.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -vf \"geq='(u>127)&&(x<=b)&&(x>=c)':0x0,geq='(u<=127)&&(x<=b)&&(x>=c)':0x0,geq='(u<=127)&&(x<=(b-width))&&(x>=(b-width+width/2))':0x0,geq='(u>127)&&(x<=(b-width))&&(x>=(b-width+width/2))':0x0,hBlur=20,hpad=if(gt(ih,'1080*9/16'),'1080*9/16',0), scale=1080:1920:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1920:1080:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2\" -c:a copy -movflags +faststart story_widescreen_16x9.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `hBlur=20`: Applies horizontal motion blur with a blur strength of 20 pixels.\n- `hpad=if(gt(ih,'1080*9/16'),'1080*9/16',0)`: Determines if the height exceeds 1080 or is less, pads only when needed, avoiding black bars too large or none at all.\n- `iw` and `ih` are input width and height.\n- `scale=1080:1920:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease,pad=1920:1080:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2`: Scales the width to 1080 while preserving aspect ratio, then pads the excess height to 1080 (if padding needed) centered.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- You want a 1920x1080 widescreen output.\n- Using H.264 video encoding, widely compatible in most players.\n- Audio will be copied (assumes desired).\n\nIf you want a different resolution, change `1080:1920` accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated is likely to fail due to the incorrect and overly complex use of filters and syntax that does not adhere to standard ffmpeg practices. The command has a complicated and unclear structure, which does not accurately reflect how to add blurred bars simply within the ffmpeg framework.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. Although it may have flaws, it does not contain a reference to a non-existent preset (like `extra_fast`). Instead, the command is constructed with various filter options, though they are not correctly implemented.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. In particular, some of the filter usage is incorrect, such as the filter `geq` being misapplied, and there are likely syntax issues in the way the filters and parameters are structured. The approach proposed lacks clarity and proper execution after consulting the examples in the man page. The command is overcomplicated and doesn't clearly accomplish the task as requested.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output does contain issues in terms of generating an appropriate ffmpeg command, as it does not effectively meet the user's needs or adhere to standard usage, which ultimately should lead to a failure in its evaluation."
