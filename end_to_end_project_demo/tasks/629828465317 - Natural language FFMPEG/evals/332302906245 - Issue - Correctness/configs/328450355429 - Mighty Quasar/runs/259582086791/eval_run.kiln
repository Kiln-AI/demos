  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect to your video using `ffmpeg`, you can use its video filter (`-vf`) capabilities. You’ll chain multiple filters using a comma-separated list in the `-vf` option. Here's what each part does:\n\n1. **Drawtext Filter (`drawtext`)**: Adds text to the video. You can specify font, size, color, position, and the actual text content.\n2. **Boxblur Filter (`boxblur`)**: Applies a blur effect, either to the whole video or a specific region. You can specify the strength of blurring.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The font `Arial` is installed and accessible (you can use `drawtext` dynamic font selection or override with custom fonts).\n- You want to add the text \"Sample Text\" with white color (`color=white`) at the top-left of the frame (`x=10:y=10`).\n- You want to apply a moderate blur with a radius of `5`.\n\nHere is the appropriate command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur=5, drawtext=fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf: text='Sample Text': fontcolor=white: fontsize=24: x=10: y=10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `boxblur=5`: Applies a box blur with radius 5 to the video before text overlay.\n- `drawtext=`: Adds the specified text using the declared font settings.\n- `fontfile=.../DejaVuSans.ttf`: Path to a system font file — modify this path if you have a different font.\n- `text='Sample Text'`: The text you want to overlay.\n- `fontcolor=white`, `fontsize=24`: Aesthetics of the text.\n- `x=10:y=10`: Position where text will be drawn.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without reencoding.\n\n### Tip:\nYou can rearrange the filters if you need text to be blurred too (blur the entire video first or blur the text separately). Also, make sure to escape quotes properly if running this in the shell or using special characters in the text.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly overlays text and applies a blur effect to the video, which meets the user's request for chaining multiple video filters. The provided command appears to be syntactically correct and valid for `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command generated by the model includes valid filters and parameters, while the example of a failing command (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) includes a non-existent option. \n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used are valid, and the order is respected (filters are applied before the output file specification). While the `fontfile` option assumes a specific path to a font file that may need to be adjusted on different systems, this is consistent with typical usage for specifying fonts.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should be marked as **pass**. The command provided is valid and aligns with the requirements set forth by the user."
