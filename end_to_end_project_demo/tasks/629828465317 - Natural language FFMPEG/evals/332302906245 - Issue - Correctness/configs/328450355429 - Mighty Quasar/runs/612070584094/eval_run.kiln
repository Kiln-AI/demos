  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` to an MP4 file with a fixed video bitrate of exactly 5000 kb/s using variable bitrate (VBR) mode, you should use the `-b:v` option to set the target bitrate and `-maxrate` along with `-bufsize` to control the bitrate variability and buffering. For H.264 encoding, `libx264` is the most compatible encoder. Additionally, setting `-preset` balances speed and quality, and including `-movflags +faststart` makes the MP4 streamable in browsers.\n\nUsing `-b:v 5000k` sets the target bitrate. Enable VBR quality with `-qp` (constant quality mode), but to restrict bitrate tightly around 5000 kb/s, you want to use `-b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k`, which allows some bitrate fluctuation around the target.\n\nBelow is the recommended command assuming you want 5000 kb/s average bitrate with slight VBR:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -preset medium -b:v 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -c:a aac -b:a 256k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-b:v 5000k`: Sets our target video bitrate to 5000 kb/s.\n- `-maxrate 5000k`: Maximum bitrate cap (you could increase slightly for more VBR flexibility, but keeping same for consistency).\n- `-bufsize 10000k`: Buffer size for bitrate fluctuation control (twice the target for some VBR fluctuation).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 256k`: Uses AAC audio codec with 256 kb/s bitrate for good quality.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures maximum compatibility.\n- `-preset medium`: Balances encoding speed and compression efficiency.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Optimizes MP4 for streaming and playback start times.\n\nIf you need the bitrate to be zero (zero encoder quality loss), you would use `-crf` but `-b:v` enforces fixed bitrate. For strict CBR, replace `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` with `-minrate` and explicit bitrate control.\n\nThis approach gives you consistent bitrate targeting with VBR flexibility around the 5000 kb/s target.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command fulfills the user's requirement of converting `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 with a bitrate locked to exactly 5000 kb/s using VBR settings. The output accurately details the command parameters and explains the methodology used to achieve the desired results.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. While the command includes various options, all of them are valid based on the provided `ffmpeg` man pages and guidelines. There are no obviously incorrect options, such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All the parameters used---`-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, `-c:v libx264`, `-preset medium`, `-c:a aac`, `-b:a 256k`, `-pix_fmt yuv420p`, and `-movflags +faststart`---are valid and appropriately applied. The command adheres to the general rules of option application as stated in the man pages.\n\n4) Given that the command operates correctly according to the outlined requirements, it can be concluded that the output does not contain the issue described. The command is properly formed and fulfills the user's request without error. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
