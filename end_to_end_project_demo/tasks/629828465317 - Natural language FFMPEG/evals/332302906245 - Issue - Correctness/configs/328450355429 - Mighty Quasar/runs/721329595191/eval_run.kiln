  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": " To map specific streams from `multi.avi` and combine them into a single `ffmpeg` MP4 file (`final.mp4`), we need to specify input streams' indices and use the appropriate codecs for compatibility and quality. In this example, we assume Stream 3 is the video (`-map 0:v:3`) and Stream 2 is the audio (`-map 0:a:2`):\n\n- `-map 0:v:3` selects the third video stream from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the second audio stream from the input file. Since audio streams are typically in the order A-B-C, weâ€™re assuming that the second audio track is the desired one.\n\nThe following command provides an example of converting the specified streams into a high-quality MP4 file, using VBR for video (`-c:v copy`) and AAC for audio encoding at a comfortable bitrate (`-c:a aac -b:a 192k`), as AAC is widely accepted and offers good quality:\n\n- Use `-c:v copy` to transcode the video stream without re-encoding while utilizing reference encoding for quality.\n- AAC audio at 192kbps (recommended for good quality streaming without too much file size).\n- `-movflags +faststart` will prepare the MP4 file for quicker playback when streaming, especially during buffering.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes that streaming container-format supports these stream mappings (MPEG-2 Transport Stream (MKV) allows more arbitrary-stream concatenation, for example, but might require additional steps to create a complete container file).\n\nFor more robust video streaming, you may also consider transcoding these streams to WebM via the DaVinci Resolve software if you wish to take advantage of the free and open container web format (`mkv` or `webm`) that is generally well-supported.\n\nHere's a DaVinci Resolve command for that purpose:\n\n```bash\nDAVINCI_PATH -t IVMPVWriter -i multi.avi -o final.webm\n```\n\nThis command is geared towards the latest version of DaVinci Resolve and involves using a custom-designed transcoding tool built into DaVinci Resolve, IVMPVWriter.\n\n**Note: Before running these commands, ensure you have the correct versions of the software installed and replace `DAVINCI_PATH` with the actual path to your DaVinci Resolve executable.**",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses appropriate codecs for creating the output MP4 file. However, there are some ambiguities and assumptions made in the explanation such as using `-c:v copy` which may not apply if the codec isn't compatible or if the user requires re-encoding.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart final.mp4`) is syntactically correct, and it uses valid options based on the required task. The `extra_fast` preset from the failure example does not correlate with any errors in the model output.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly specifies the input file, properly maps the specified video and audio streams, sets the codecs for output, and includes the `-movflags +faststart` option for streaming. The command follows the structure outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is logically correct, follows required syntax, and matches the user's request for mapping streams from the input file. Therefore, I conclude that the output passes this evaluation."
