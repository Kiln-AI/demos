  "output": "To map specific streams from an input file, use the `-map` option with the stream specifiers:\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (stream indices start at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream.\n\nAssuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding (to preserve quality and speed up the process), use `-c copy`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears correct and should successfully map the specified video and audio streams without any errors based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command does not reference any nonexistent options or values; all parameters and stream mappings used are valid and conform to the syntax and functionality of the `ffmpeg` command.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It is structured correctly and uses valid options specified in the documentation. Mapping streams, as performed in the command, follows the allowed syntax outlined in the man page and does not violate any rules regarding option placement or functionality.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation as it meets all requirements effectively."
