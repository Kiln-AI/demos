  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",

  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output command correctly extracts the first video stream and the third audio stream from the input file `movie.mkv` and saves them in `final.mp4`. The command uses the `-map` option correctly to select the desired streams, and it employs the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding. This approach meets the user requirements without introducing errors or issues. Therefore, the output does **not contain the issue described**.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The output command does not resemble the failing example provided. The failing example contains a specific error with a non-existent preset, while the model's command is syntactically correct and employs valid options for stream extraction. As such, the model's output does **not resemble the failure example**.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command follows the requirements and guidelines provided in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` options to specify which streams to extract and applies the `-c copy` option to copy them to the output file without transcoding. This conforms to the intended use of options as indicated in the documentation. Therefore, the command does **not break any requirements**.\n\n4) **Evaluation Result:**\n   The model's output does not contain any issues, does not resemble a failing example, and complies with the ffmpeg man page requirements. The evaluation should be marked as **pass**."
