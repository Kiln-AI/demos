  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add a subtitle track to your video while removing any existing subtitle tracks, you'll need to provide the new subtitle file. Assuming your video file is `input.mp4`, the subtitle file is `subtitles.srt`, and the output file will be `output.mp4`, here's how you can do it:\n\n- `-i subtitles.srt` adds the new subtitle track.\n- `-s:s 0` tells ffmpeg to remove any existing subtitle tracks (0 means the first subtitle stream).\n\nThe command below uses the '-vf subtitles' input file to hardcode the subtitles directly onto the video frame. The result is subs can be displayed by any video player.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng -s:s 0 -sn output.mp4\n```\nIf you intend on keeping subtitles in the video as `text` streams, not hardcoding them (removing the bit here `vf subtitles=subtitles.srt`, two subs would be result: ones that that play automatically `metadata:s:s:0 language=eng` and the subscripted previously existing streams). \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng -map 0 -map 1 -s:s 0 -sn output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input video is in `input.mp4`.\n- The new subtitle file is in `subtitles.srt` and is in the same directory.\n- The output will be saved in the same directory as `output.mp4`.\n- You're keeping the original audio codec (`-c:a copy` flag).\n- The added subtitle track's language is English (`metadata:s:s:0 language=eng`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model’s output contains an issue as it does not correctly fulfill the user's requirement to \"remove all existing subtitle tracks.\" The command uses `-s:s 0`, which may not achieve the intended effect of removing existing subtitles, while also attempting to add new subtitles with the `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\"` command. The user explicitly requests that all existing subtitle tracks be removed, and the output should not incorporate hardcoding subtitles if the user wishes to keep the option open to playback the subtitles in a selectable manner.\n\n2) The output does not closely resemble the provided failure example. The command structure is maintained, and it does not specify an argument that is outright invalid, but it still performs incorrectly based on the user’s specific request.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page, particularly relating to the management of subtitle streams. The combination of adding new subtitles while attempting to simultaneously remove existing ones is not appropriately handled. Using `-sn` only disables recording of subtitle streams but does not guarantee their removal if they already exist in the input file. Additionally, `-s:s 0` does not effectively manage the removal of existing subtitle streams in this context.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output should be marked as failing due to the issues in removing existing subtitle tracks and the misinterpretation of the user command."
