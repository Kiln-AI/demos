  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect in a single ffmpeg command, you chain video filters with commas. The filters are applied sequentially from left to right.\n\nFor example:\n- Use the `drawtext` filter to overlay text.\n- Use the `boxblur` filter to apply a blur effect.\n- Chain them as `drawtext=... , boxblur=...`\n\nThe general syntax for chaining filters is: `-vf \"filter1=..., filter2=...\"`.\n\nHere is a basic example that overlays the text \"Sample Text\" at the top-left corner, then applies a blur to the entire video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='Sample Text':x=10:y=10:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24,boxblur=10:1\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `drawtext=text='Sample Text':x=10:y=10:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24` overlays white text near the top-left corner.\n- `boxblur=10:1` applies a blur with luma_radius=10 and luma_power=1 (adjust to control blur strength).\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio without re-encoding.\n\nIf you want to blur only the background and overlay crisp text on top, you'd need a more complex filtergraph with splitting and overlaying, which I can provide if needed. Let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command provided correctly chains multiple video filters and matches the user requirements of overlaying text and applying a blur effect. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command does not contain any unsupported options or incorrect syntax. It correctly utilizes valid ffmpeg filters and syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It adheres to the specified rules regarding options and their sequence. The chaining of filters using the `-vf \"filter1,filter2\"` syntax is valid, and the specific filters used (`drawtext` and `boxblur`) are correct.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is accurate and functional. The command generated correctly implements the user's request to overlay text and apply a blur effect, while the explanation provides clarity on the options used. Therefore, the output passes evaluation and does not contain any issues."
