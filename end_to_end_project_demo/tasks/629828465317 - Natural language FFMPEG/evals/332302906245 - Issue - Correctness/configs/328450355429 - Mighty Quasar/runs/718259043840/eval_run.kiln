  "output": "To combine multiple MP4 files without re-encoding (thus avoiding quality loss or artifacts), you can use the concat demuxer, but the inputs must have the same codec, codec parameters, and format. This method just joins the files at the data level.\n\n- Create a text file listing the input files in order.\n- Use `-c copy` to copy streams without re-encoding.\n\nAssuming your files are compatible as is:\n\nCreate a file named `file_list.txt` with:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\nThen run this command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy full_movie.mp4\n```\n\nThis will concatenate the files quickly without any re-encoding, preserving original quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description> section. It correctly utilizes the FFmpeg concat demuxer approach to combine video files without re-encoding, which aligns with the user's requirement of avoiding re-encoding artifacts.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example> provided. The command produced is correct and does not include any non-existent options or parameters, unlike the example of the failing output where a preset (`extra_fast`) does not exist.\n\n3) The command provided in the model's output adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-f concat` option along with `-i` to specify the input file list, utilizes `-c copy` to ensure streams are copied without re-encoding, and does not include any conflicting options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, we can conclude that it passes the evaluation. The command is functioning as intended and matches the user's requirement efficiently."
