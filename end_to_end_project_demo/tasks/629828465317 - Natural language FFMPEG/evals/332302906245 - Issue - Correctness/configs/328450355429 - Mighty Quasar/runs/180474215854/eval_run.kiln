  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": "To convert your video to H.265 (HEVC) format using the `veryfast2` preset, you'll use the `libx265` codec for video encoding. While `veryfast2` isn’t a standard `x265` preset, it may be a custom or extended preset available in your system, so I assume it serves a similar purpose to the standard `veryfast` preset—offering faster encoding at the cost of slightly less compression efficiency.\n\n- `c:v libx265` sets the video codec to HEVC/H.265.\n- `preset veryfast2` tells `libx265` to use this custom preset for encoding speed. If this exact preset isn't available, you may need to replace it with one of the standard x265 presets.\n- Audio is preserved in its original format unless specified otherwise.\n\nIf there’s no audio in the input or if you need a specific container format like MP4, more parameters may be necessary. For now, I’ll use `.mkv` as the output container, which has native support for H.265.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 output.mkv\n``` \n\n> **Note**: If you encounter an error about `veryfast2`, replace it with one of the standard libx265 presets like `veryslow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, or `veryfast`. Since `veryfast2` is non-standard, it might not be supported on all systems.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue related to the use of `veryfast2` as a preset. This preset is not one of the standard `libx265` presets documented in the ffmpeg documentation. Instead, it suggests that this is either a custom or non-standard preset, which could lead to errors during execution. Therefore, this output could potentially fail to run as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failing example, as both involve a nonexistent preset. In this case, the standard fast presets are `veryslow`, `slow`, `medium`, `fast`, and `veryfast`, which are recognized by ffmpeg, and using a non-standard one like `veryfast2` can lead to an execution failure, similar to the example that mentioned an undefined preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page, aside from potentially using a non-standard preset for encoding. The command structure follows the correct format and includes options that are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does indeed contain the issue described. Therefore, it should fail the evaluation."
