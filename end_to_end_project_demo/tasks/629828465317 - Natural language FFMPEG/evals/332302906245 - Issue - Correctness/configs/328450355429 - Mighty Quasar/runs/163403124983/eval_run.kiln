  "input": "I need to encode this video with 8000k video bitrate and 512k audio bitrate.",
  "output": "To set a specific video bitrate of 8000 kbps and an audio bitrate of 512 kbps, use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options. This example assumes H.264 video encoding (common for compatibility) and AAC audio encoding (standard for web and mobile), which are widely supported and ensure the bitrates are applied correctly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -c:v libx264 -b:a 512k -c:a aac output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets the video bitrate to 8000 kbps.\n- `-c:v libx264` explicitly uses the H.264 video codec for compatibility.\n- `-b:a 512k` sets the audio bitrate to 512 kbps.\n- `-c:a aac` ensures AAC audio encoding, which is optimal for streaming and quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain issues as described in the issue description. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 8000k -c:v libx264 -b:a 512k -c:a aac output.mp4`) is syntactically correct and utilizes the appropriate parameters to meet the user's request for specific video and audio bitrates.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any incorrect parameters or improperly specified options. It uses valid options that are recognized by `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used (`-b:v`, `-c:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:a`) are valid and correctly applied based on the man page's specifications. The output formats and codecs are supported by `ffmpeg` as specified.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any of the issues described, the evaluation should be considered as **passing**."
