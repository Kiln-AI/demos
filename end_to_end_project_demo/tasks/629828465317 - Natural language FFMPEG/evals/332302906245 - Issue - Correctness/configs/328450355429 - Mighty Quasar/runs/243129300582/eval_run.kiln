    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The command generated by the model accurately meets the user's requirements by extracting the specified video and audio streams from the input file and saving them as the output file. The `-map` options correctly identify the desired streams based on the indices provided by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any obviously incorrect parameters or flags. The syntax and flag usage are appropriate, matching the requirements specified in the user input.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The usage of `-map` is done correctly, and using `-c copy` implies that the audio and video streams will be copied directly without re-encoding. This is a valid and effective way to extract streams and create the output file without losing quality.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain an issue, and it correctly fulfills the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
