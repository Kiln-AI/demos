    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated `ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -b:v:0 8000k -b:a:0 512k -map 0 output_video.mp4` correctly specifies the video and audio bitrates as requested by the user. The command follows the syntax rules outlined in the ffmpeg documentation and uses appropriate options to set bitrates for video and audio.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output. The provided command is valid and adheres to the structure required for setting bitrates and mapping streams, whereas the failure example uses a nonexistent preset option which would definitely fail.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, and `-map`) are all valid and correctly applied according to the input-output structure required in ffmpeg syntax.\n\n4) Based on the above analysis, the model's output does **not contain the issue described**. The command is valid, matches the user requirements, and adheres to the ffmpeg syntax rules. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
