  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 10000000 bits per second (10 Mbps) and the audio bitrate to 1000000 bits per second (1 Mbps), you can use the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options respectively. The `-maxrate` parameter is also set to the same as video bitrate to ensure the specified bitrate is not exceeded. The `-bufsize` parameter is set to twice the bitrate, this is a recommended practice. I am also setting the audio codec to aac, the video codec to libx264, and setting the `-movflags` parameter to `+faststart` for faster streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000000 -maxrate 10000000 -bufsize 20000000 -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command effectively meets the user's request to set specific bitrates for video and audio and outlines the necessary options to achieve that. The parameters used are valid for FFmpeg.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. It does not contain any erroneous parameters or commands that would cause it to fail. Each parameter is appropriate for the functionality it intends to achieve.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, and all specified options are valid. The order of options and parameters aligns with FFmpeg's expected input format.\n\n4) Since the output correctly fulfills the user's requirements and uses valid FFmpeg commands without errors, it should pass the evaluation."
