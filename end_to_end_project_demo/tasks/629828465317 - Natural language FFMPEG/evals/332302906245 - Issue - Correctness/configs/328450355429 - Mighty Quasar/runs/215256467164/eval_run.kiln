  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your file with a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps for the video stream, you should use the -b:v option to specify the desired video bitrate. If you want to keep the original audio or specify it separately depends on your needs; here, I'll keep it unchanged. Using -b:v 25000k sets the target bitrate for the video to 25 Mbps, ensuring consistent quality and file size.\n\n- -b:v 25000k sets a constant video bitrate of 25 Mbps.\n- Assuming you want to keep original codec and audio settings; otherwise, specify them accordingly.\n- If you want strict CBR (constant bitrate) you can use -minrate 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k to enforce it, which ensures bitrate stays at this level without variance.\n- If you want to encode to H.264, you should specify -c:v libx264 for compatibility.\n\nHere is a typical command assuming input.mp4 and encoding to H.264 with CBR:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -minrate 25000k -maxrate 25000k -bufsize 50000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maintains audio as is (-c:a copy). Adjust accordingly if you want to re-encode audio or specify codecs. The use of -minrate, -maxrate, and -bufsize enforces CBR targeting 25000 kbps.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command generated is correct for setting a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps for the video stream with a proper use of options. It adheres to the requirements of the user and appreciates the aspects of maintaining the audio stream as is, as well as providing detailed explanations for the parameters used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command constructs a valid `ffmpeg` command that follows the correct syntax and parameter usage without introducing invalid options or presets.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid options for setting the video bitrate (`-b:v`), enforcing constant bitrate flags (`-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`), and maintains the audio encoding as requested. Thus, it complies with the guidelines present in the man page.\n\n4) Since the output does not contain any issues as described and successfully meets the requirements, the evaluation passes."
