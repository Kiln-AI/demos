  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream, we can use FFmpeg's `copy` codec setting for the video stream. This tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream directly to the output without encoding or re-compressing it. We will exclude the audio stream using the `-an` option, which stands for \"no audio\".\n\nThis technique is fast and lossless for the video because the video data remains untouched.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -an -c:v copy output_video_only_no_audio.mp4\n```\n\n### Assumptions:\n- The input file `video_only.mp4` contains both video and audio streams.\n- You are looking to preserve the original video quality and format, and only want to strip the audio out.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated accurately removes the audio stream from the specified video file without re-compressing the video stream. It uses the `-c:v copy` option, ensuring that the video quality is preserved.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided, which contains an invalid command due to the use of a non-existent preset. The output from the model correctly uses valid options and parameters for the given task.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All specified options align with the documented functionalities and there are no conflicts with order or usage.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue as described. The command generated works correctly and matches the user's requirements."
