  "output": "Here's the command with the specified filters:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* You're using `ffmpeg` version 2.0 or later, as the `yadif` filter is available in this version.\n* You want to apply the specified filters to the entire video, not just a specific stream or part of the video.\n* You want to keep the same audio codec and bitrate as in the previous example.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output does not contain any issues as it correctly implements the user's request for applying multiple filters (`yadif`, `scale`, and `unsharp`). The command seems logical, follows the structure described in the man page, and accurately incorporates the specified filter chain without any syntax errors.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example, as it does not contain incorrect parameters or non-existent options. The command produced is valid and follows the standard `ffmpeg` command structure.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the general rule of options being applied to the next specified file, and it does not confuse input or output parameters. Additionally, all filters and codecs used are valid for `ffmpeg` commands. The output maintains the proper format as per the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does **NOT** contain the issue described, therefore it should pass. The command correctly addresses the user's requirements and adheres to `ffmpeg` usage guidelines."
