  "output": "You want to transcode `input.mp4` to MKV, using the x265 video codec with the `veryslow` preset, and directly copy the existing video stream without re-encoding it. This is a fast way to change container format.\n\n- `copy` tells ffmpeg to directly copy the video stream from the input to the output without re-encoding.\n- `-c:v libx265` specifies the x265 video encoder.\n- `preset veryslow` sets the encoding speed to be very slow, prioritizing quality over speed. This is important for x265 as it takes longer to encode.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -c:a copy -map 0 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \nYes, the model's output contains an issue. The command generated by the model is incorrect because it includes both `-c:v copy` and `-c:v libx265`. The command should either copy the video stream using `-c:v copy` or re-encode it with `-c:v libx265`, but not both. Mixing these options will lead to a conflict and may cause the command to fail.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?** \nYes, the model's output is similar to the failure example because it generates contradictory command options. Having both a copy command and a re-encoding command for the same video stream is an inherent logical error in the command.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?** \nYes, it breaks the requirements as per the ffmpeg man page because the model attempted to apply both `-c:v copy` (to copy the stream directly) and `-c:v libx265` (to re-encode into x265), which is not valid since they contradict each other. The man page indicates that options should not conflict, and in this case, they do.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described; therefore, it fails the evaluation. The command is incorrectly structured due to the contradictory video codec options provided."
