  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain these operations together in ffmpeg, you can use the `-vf` (video filter) option with multiple filters separated by commas. \n\n1. For stabilization, typically you'd run a two-step process using `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform`. \n2. For color grading, you can use `curves`, `colorbalance`, `eq`, or `lut` filters depending on the grading you want — I'll assume a simple brightness/contrast adjustment using `eq`.\n3. For geometric transformations, `rotate` and `scale` filters can be applied. Rotation can be done using the `rotate` filter with a specified angle in radians, and scaling with `scale`.\n\nAssuming you've already run `vidstabdetect` to create the transform data file (`transforms.trf`), you can apply the stabilization along with color correction (e.g., brighten and increase contrast) and then rotate and scale your video.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf,eq=brightness=0.06:contrast=1.2,rotate=PI/6,scale=1280:720\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf` — applies stabilization using the earlier generated transform data.\n- `eq=brightness=0.06:contrast=1.2` — increases brightness slightly and boosts contrast.\n- `rotate=PI/6` — rotates the video by 30 degrees (π/6 radians).\n- `scale=1280:720` — resizes the output to 1280x720 resolution.\n- `-c:a copy` — copies audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You've already created `transforms.trf` from the stabilization detect pass.\n- The rotation angle and scaling resolution are placeholders; you can customize as needed.\n- You want simple brightness/contrast grade; you can replace `eq` with any other color grading filter.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command effectively chains together a stabilization filter, color grading adjustment, and geometric transformations in a way that should work according to the ffmpeg documentation. The order of filters is correctly presented using the `-vf` option, and the parameters used are logical and relevant for the task at hand.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated is valid and does not contain any invalid options or incorrect preset names, which would lead to failure as seen in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-vf` option to chain multiple filters, applies standard settings for stabilization, color grading adjustments, and geometric transformations. The use of `-c:a copy` to retain the audio without re-encoding is appropriate and complies with ffmpeg usage guidelines.\n\n4) Considering the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass as it adheres to the requirements given by the user and aligns with ffmpeg documentation."
