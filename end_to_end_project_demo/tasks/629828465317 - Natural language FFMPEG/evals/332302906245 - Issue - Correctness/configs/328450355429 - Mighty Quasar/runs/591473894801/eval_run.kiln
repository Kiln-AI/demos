  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC using the experimental FLAC codec with noise reduction, you can utilize the `flac` codec in ffmpeg with the `-af` option to apply noise reduction. The noise reduction filter is available in the `af\"anlrechester\"` (Anechoic Noise Filter) or `arenavb` filters. Here, I'll use the `anlrechester` as it is a well-known noise reduction filter with the experimental FLAC codec.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-c:a flac` to encode in the `flac` codec.\n- The `-af \"anlrechester\"` applies the noise reduction filter.\n- Since `flac` is experimental, explicitly set it with `-flac:aopts`.\n- `-y` overwrites existing files without prompting.\n\nAssuming your target filename is `audio.flac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af \"anlrechester\" -c:a flac -flac:aopts \"no seeking=no\" audio.flac -y\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-af \"anlrechester\"` applies the noise reduction filter.\n- `-flac:aopts \"no seeking=no\"` is added when using experimental versions of ffmpeg to prevent certain issues.\n- Use `-y` to avoid prompt on file overwrite if it already exists.\n\nIf noise reduction options need to be fine-tuned (e.g., intensity level), the anlrechester filter accepts parameters like `min_threshold` and `max_range`, but the filter applies basic noise reduction by default. Please consult the latest FFmpeg documentation for precise filter settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated uses an invalid audio filter name `anlrechester`, which does not exist in FFmpeg. This will cause the command to fail when executed, meaning it doesn't meet the user's requirements for functional output.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example in the sense that it specifies options that do not exist or are incorrect. While the failure example had an invalid preset, the produced output includes an invalid filter name. Both result in a likely failure of the command when executed.\n\n3) According to the FFmpeg man page, the incorrect audio filter (`-af \"anlrechester\"`) used in the generated command is not valid, leading to the command breaking requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the model's output does contain the issues described and fails to generate a command that would work correctly."
