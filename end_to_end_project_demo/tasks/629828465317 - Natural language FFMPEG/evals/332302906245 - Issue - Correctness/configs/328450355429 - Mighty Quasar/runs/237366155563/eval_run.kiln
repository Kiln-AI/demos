  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as FLAC using an experimental codec while applying noise reduction, the following ffmpeg command can be applied. We will use `anaconda` as an example for an experimental codec for noise reduction, although, as of my knowledge cut-off in early 2023, \"anaconda\" is not an actual codec for noise reduction.\n\nThe `-af` switch is used to apply filters. The `arnd` (Advanced Real-time Network Demodulator) filter in ffmpeg is not an actual known noise reduction filter as of early 2023, rather you might want to look into using 'lanczos' for resampling, or applying a noise reduction via the `rnns` (Robust Noise Reduction) audio filter which might not be \"experimental\" but is sophisticated nonetheless. Additionally, `-e:a flac` is used for encoding the output audio stream to FLAC with the most common FLAC options. Assumptions have been made that the user would like to use a valid audio denoising/processing filter group and that the FLAC codec is desirable. However, we'll assume that the user has a filter like 'ain' (Adaptive Input Noise) group ready in their ffmpeg installation. Hereâ€™s the necessary command with explanations included in the triple backtick code blocks:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -af \"lvrn:shape=commut,arnd,weight=1:weight=0:width=2.0:height=2.0:center=0:0:0:smoothing=0.5\":gnn:fast=True -vn -c:a flac -e:a flac noise_reduction_output.flac\n```\n\nLet's break down the filters and options:\n- `lvrn` is the loudness and reverberation denoising and refining tool.\n- `shape=commut` configures the shape of the reverberation.\n- `arnd` determines the EPG (Event, Pattern, Group) metrics.\n- `weight`, `width`, `height`, and `center` are parameters to adjust the shape of the lvrn filter accordingly.\n- `smoothing` is the smoothness parameter, easing the transition between pieces of denoised audio.\n- `gnn:fast=True` activates the gating network with a configuration that allows for faster processing.\n- `-vn` drops the video stream and extracts only the audio.\n- `-c:a flac` specifies that the output audio codec should be FLAC with usual options.\n\nPlease replace `arnd` and `lvrn` with actual noise reduction filters available in your ffmpeg installation as they may refer to different types of filters than expected. These filters are meant to simulate options and are intended for explanatory purposes.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The command generated uses filters and codecs that do not exist or are inaccurately referenced, particularly the 'anaconda' codec for noise reduction and the 'arnd' filter, which do not correspond to valid ffmpeg options. This means the command does not fulfill the user's request accurately and will likely fail if executed.\n\n2) Yes, the output is similar to the example of failing output since it includes options and filters that don't exist or are incorrectly specified, which would lead to a failure in execution.\n\n3) Yes, the command proposed by the model breaks requirements dictated in the man page. Specifically, it mentions non-existent filters and uses incorrect syntax for setting audio encoding options. The use of 'lvrn' and 'arnd' as filters does not correspond to valid ffmpeg filters as indicated in the man pages, which suggests that the command will not work correctly.\n\nIn summary, the model's output does contain the issues described, is similar to the failure example, and does not comply with the requirements of the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it fails to generate a valid and executable ffmpeg command for the user's request."
