  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert `audio.ogg` to WAV format using the Vorbis decoder and resample to 48kHz, decode the Vorbis audio stream (default for `.ogg`), resample the audio to 48,000 Hz with `aresample`, and encode the output as PCM WAV with 16-bit depth (standard for WAV compatibility). The `-f wav` flag ensures the output format is enforced.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -af aresample=48000 -f wav output.wav\n```\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. The input is a standard Vorbis-encoded `.ogg` file.\n2. The user wants the audio in stereo (channel count not specified, so it is preserved).\n3. 16-bit integer depth is assumed for the WAV output (`-c:a pcm_s16le` is implicit for WAV).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated: `ffmpeg -i audio.ogg -af aresample=48000 -f wav output.wav` is syntactically correct and appears to follow the user's request for converting the audio file and resampling it correctly. There are no mistakes in the command.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example, which featured a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`). The command generated by the model is valid, using existing options and parameters that are standard for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly specifies the input file, applies an audio filter to resample the audio to 48 kHz, and forces the output format to WAV. The command uses standard options and adheres to the syntax rules outlined.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues as outlined above, it passes. The command is functional and meets the user's requirements effectively."
