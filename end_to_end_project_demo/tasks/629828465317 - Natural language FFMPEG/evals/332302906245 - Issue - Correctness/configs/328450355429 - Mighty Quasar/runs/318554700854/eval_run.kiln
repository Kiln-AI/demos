  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map only the third audio stream from `movie.mkv` while keeping the original video intact, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. Since the video is the first stream and the third audio stream is desired, you need to specify the video stream (0:v) and the third audio stream (0:a:2). This assumes that the input file has at least three audio streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-map 0:v` selects the first video stream (index 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (index 2) from the input file.\n- The output format is inferred as MP4 based on the file extension, but you can explicitly set it with `-f mp4` if needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the original video stream and the specified audio stream based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output provided in the failure example. The produced command is valid and doesn't contain any incorrect preset or option. It correctly utilizes the `-map` option.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It adheres to the correct syntax by specifying the input file followed by the desired output stream mapping, and it utilizes valid stream index notation.\n\n4) Overall, the model’s output is correct and fulfills the user’s request without issues. Hence, it should pass the evaluation."
