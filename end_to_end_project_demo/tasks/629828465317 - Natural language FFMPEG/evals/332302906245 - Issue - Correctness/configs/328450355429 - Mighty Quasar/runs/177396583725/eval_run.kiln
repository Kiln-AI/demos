  "input": "Take my 4K video `drone.mp4` and make it lossless, but the final file size must be under 20MB.",
  "output": "To meet the constraints of \"lossless\" compression and a final file size under 20MB for a 4K input video, we must **reduce the resolution significantly** and use a **lossless video codec** (e.g., `libx264` with `crf 0`). Lossless encoding at native 4K would be impossible to keep under 20MB due to high bitrates, so scaling is essential. If the video is static or contains minimal motion, this might work, but for longer videos or complex content, the file size could still exceed 20MB.\n\nThis command assumes:\n- You’re okay with a **shrunk resolution** (720p here).\n- The original video has a resolution divisible by lossless scaling factors.\n- Audio is either short or low complexity (`copy` retains original quality but contributes to file size if high bitrate).\n- You accept a **non-lossless audio** track (since re-encoding lossless audio like FLAC would increase file size further).\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i drone.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720 -sws_flags +accurate_rnd+full_chroma_interp -preset ultrafast -crf 0 -c:a copy lossless_4k_downscale.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**Key Parameters Explained:**\n\n- `-vf scale=1280:720`: Reduces the 4K resolution (3840x2160) to 720p using exact scaling (factor of 3 reduction). This preserves the video's structure better when upscaled later.\n- `-sws_flags +accurate_rnd+full_chroma_interp`: Ensures precise rescaling using interpolation (for \"lossless\" output when scaling down a compatible resolution).\n- `-crf 0`: Full lossless quality for H.264 encoding (no visible compression artifacts).\n- `-preset ultrafast`: Prioritizes encoding speed over efficiency to reduce computational burden.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies audio as-is without re-encoding.\n\nIf this output still exceeds 20MB, further scaling (e.g., to 480p or 360p) or reducing duration is necessary.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and adheres to the user's request for a lossless video under 20MB. The explanation effectively addresses the need for resolution reduction and correctly specifies the codec and parameters.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command syntax is correct, and all specified parameters exist and are appropriately applied. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters used in the command, such as `-vf`, `-sws_flags`, `-crf`, `-preset`, and `-c:a`, are valid and correctly formatted according to the rules described in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues. Hence, it passes the evaluation."
