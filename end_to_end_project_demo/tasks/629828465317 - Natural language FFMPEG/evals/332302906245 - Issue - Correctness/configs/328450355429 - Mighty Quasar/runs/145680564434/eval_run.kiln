  "output": "To select the 5th video stream (index 0:4) and 10th audio stream (index 0:9) from your MKV file and encode them into an MP4 container with browser-compatible settings:\n\n- **`-map 0:4`**: Selects video stream at index 4 from the input (MKV). This is the 5th stream (0-based indexing).\n- **`-map 0:9`**: Selects audio stream at index 9 (10th stream) from the input.\n- **`-c:v libx264`**: Re-encodes video to H.264 for MP4 compatibility.\n- **`-c:a aac`**: Re-encodes audio to AAC (MP4 standard codec).\n- **`-pix_fmt yuv420p`**: Ensures pixel format is supported by all browsers.\n- **`-movflags +faststart`** is optional but recommended for streaming; it’s included here for consistency with the prior example.\n\nAssumptions:\n1. Streams 0:4 (video) and 0:9 (audio) exist and are contiguous.\n2. Re-encoding is necessary if the original streams are not H.264/AAC (common for MKV sources).\n3. Resolution and bitrate of original streams are preserved unless specified otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is appropriate for the user’s request to select specific video and audio streams and convert them to an MP4 format. It follows the correct syntax for using `ffmpeg`, as all parameters and options are valid.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect parameters, such as nonexistent preset values that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options used by the model are valid, and the generated syntax adheres to the rules of FFmpeg for selecting streams and setting encoding formats. The order of the options is correct as well.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully meets the requirements given by the user. Therefore, it should be marked as passing in this evaluation."
