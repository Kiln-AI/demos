  "output": "To extract the third audio track and preserve the original video from a multi-track MKV file, use `-map` to explicitly select streams and specify codecs.\n\n- `0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (indexing starts at 0).\n- `0:v` selects the first video stream (assuming one video stream exists).\n- `copy` ensures the video/audio is transferred without re-encoding.\n- Assumed output format is `.mkv` because MP4 supports only one audio track.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issues described in the issue description. It correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command to extract the third audio stream and keep the original video from the input file. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not contain incorrect options or using options that do not exist. It correctly specifies the audio and video streams to be mapped.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It properly uses `-map` to select the correct audio and video streams, and uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding. The syntax adheres to the rules outlined in the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluation, the model's output does not contain any issues, and therefore it passes the evaluation."
