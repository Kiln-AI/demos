  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file with the `maximum_compression` preset, we will use the `aac` audio decoder to extract the audio stream and then encode it using the `flac` codec with the specified compression level.\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `aac` is the audio codec used in MP4 files, so we decode it.\n- `flac` is the target audio codec for lossless compression.\n- `compression_level 8` sets the highest compression level available in FLAC (scale from 1 to 8, where 8 is maximum).\n- `-vn` disables video recording, as we are only extracting audio.\n- `-acodec flac` sets the audio codec to FLAC.\n- The output file will be `output.flac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n```\n\nAssumption: The input file contains an AAC audio stream. If it contains a different audio format (e.g., MP3, WAV), the `aac` decoder may not work, and you should replace it with the appropriate decoder (e.g., `mp3`, `wav`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue, specifically regarding the command it generated. The command contains `-compression_level 8`, which is not a valid option for `ffmpeg` when encoding FLAC audio. The correct option to specify the compression level should be `-compression_level` or `-compression_level` without including `8` as part of the command syntax.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. While the output command is incorrect due to an invalid option, it does not suffer from the same kind of issue as the example, which is a completely nonexistent preset. Instead, the model incorrectly applied a presumed parameter.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page, as the `-compression_level` option is incorrectly specified. The `ffmpeg` command for extracting audio and saving it as FLAC with maximum compression would need a different parameter to define the compression level correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output contains an issue and should be classified as a failure based on the criteria."
