  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert `movie.mkv` to MP4 while using the `ultrafast` preset (assuming a typo in \"ultrafast2\") for maximum encoding speed, re-encode video to H.264 and audio to AAC. The `-preset ultrafast` optimizes for speed at the cost of compression efficiency. `-crf 23` balances quality (lower values are better) for reencoding, `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures browser compatibility, and `-movflags +faststart` enables streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n### Assumptions:\n1. You want reencoding (not just container conversion) for compatibility.\n2. Audio quality preference unspecified; using `-b:a 192k` for reasonable stereo audio.\n3. The video was likely in a different pixel format or codec (e.g., HEVC), requiring re-encode for MP4. If you want to copy streams directly, use `ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4` (but ensure codecs already work in MP4).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does *not* contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is correctly formatted and should execute without errors according to the FFmpeg capabilities described. The parameters chosen, such as `-preset ultrafast`, are valid.\n\n2) The model's output is *not* similar to the failure example you provided. The command `-preset ultrafast` is valid; hence it would not produce a similar failure as the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It follows the required order of input options, codec specifications, and output formatting correctly.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output should pass as it does not contain the issues described, generating a working and appropriate command without breaking any rules from the FFmpeg man page."
