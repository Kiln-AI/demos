  "input": "Please convert my file.mov to MP4 using the vp9 codec with the ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert file.mov to MP4 using VP9 video (note that MP4 container support for VP9 is limited and not as widely supported as WebM), I'll use libvpx-vp9 for encoding with the ultrafast preset for speed over quality, copying the original audio track, and assuming standard web-compatible settings.\n\n- c:v libvpx-vp9 selects VP9 video codec\n- speed 5 (ultrafast) - note VP9 uses speed 0-8 rather than named presets\n- tile-columns 6 and frame-parallel 1 help parallelization for ultrafast\n- auto-alt-ref and lag-in-frames disabled for speed, as these are quality-focused features\n- -an removes audio since you only specified VP9 (add -c:a copy or -c:a libopus if you want audio)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -speed 5 -tile-columns 6 -frame-parallel 1 -auto-alt-ref 0 -lag-in-frames 0 -an output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: For better VP9 compatibility across browsers/devices, consider using .webm container instead of .mp4. VP9 in MP4 has limited support compared to H.264 in MP4.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue as the command it generated suggests using `-speed 5` for the ultrafast preset, but `speed` parameters for VP9 use ranges from 0 to 8, with 0 being the slowest (highest quality) and 8 being the fastest (lowest quality). The ultrafast setting should be represented by `-speed 8`. Although copying the audio track (`-an` is used to disable audio), it does not match the user's request if they want to retain the original audio.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example because it does not generate an option that is strictly invalid. However, the use of `-speed 5` can be considered incorrect if the user strictly wants the ultrafast preset (which is instead speed 8).\n\n3) Upon reviewing the man page, the model command does not explicitly break requirements dictated. However, using the wrong speed value contradicts the intent of the user to use \"ultrafast,\" which could lead to confusion or failure to achieve estimated performance.\n\nConsidering all steps, the output is problematic due to the incorrect parameter associated with \"ultrafast.\" Hence, the evaluation concludes that the model's output fails due to not generating a correct ffmpeg command as per the user requirements."
