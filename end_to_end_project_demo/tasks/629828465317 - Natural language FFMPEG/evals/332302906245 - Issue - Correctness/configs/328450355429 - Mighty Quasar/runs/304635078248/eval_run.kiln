  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map specific video and audio streams from a complex media file (in this case input.mov), you use the `-map` option with specific stream specifiers. The general format is `-map <stream_specifier>`, where the specifier can be `\"0:<stream_index>\"` for the `input.mov` file.\n\nYou want to map the 7th video stream (index 6) and the 14th audio stream (index 13) from `input.mov`. The command will specify these mappings accordingly.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is named input.mov as specified.\n- If there are multiple audio and video streams in a complex container (like MOV), you want to explicitly map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream.\n- The output container will be MP4, which typically supports the codecs commonly found inside your complex MOV. ffmpeg will select sensible default codecs.\n\nHere's how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:6 -map 0:13 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:6` selects the 7th video stream (index 6).\n- `-map 0:13` selects the 14th audio stream (index 13).\n- `-c copy` copies all selected streams without re-encoding.\n\nThis command efficiently creates an output containing only the specified video and audio streams from your complex media file, mapped directly from the input (fastest and lowest-quality copy operation).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from the input file without errors. The use of `-map` is appropriate and aligns with the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command is valid and correctly uses the options and syntax required by `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It follows the proper syntax for mapping streams, and the use of `-c copy` adheres to the guidelines without violating any order of options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described and adheres to the requirements from the man page, it passes the evaluation. The command produced is valid and matches the user's request effectively."
