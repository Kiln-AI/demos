  "input": "I need to convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert `video.avi` to WebM format using the VP8 video codec with the \"realtime\" encoding preset and constant bitrate mode, you'll need to specify the video codec as `libvpx` (FFmpeg's VP8 implementation), set the `-preset realtime` for fast encoding, and use `-b:v` to enforce a constant video bitrate. Since no specific bitrate was provided, a common default of `2M` (2 Mbps) is used. The audio codec is automatically handled by FFmpeg as `libvorbis`, which is standard for WebM.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -preset realtime -b:v 2M -c:a libvorbis video.webm\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file `video.avi` contains both video and audio streams (if not, FFmpeg will handle it gracefully).  \n- The `-preset realtime` is applied to the `libvpx` encoder, which optimizes for speed.  \n- If you want a specific audio bitrate, you'd need to add `-b:a <value>` (e.g., `-b:a 128k`).  \n- The output is saved as `video.webm` in the same directory.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output successfully generates a command that matches the user's request to convert the video to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the realtime preset and for constant bitrate. There are no issues in command syntax or parameters, meaning that it meets the user message requirements.\n\n2) The output does not resemble any failing examples, since the command given is valid and follows the correct syntax for FFmpeg. There’s no indication of an invalid preset, codec, or other command structure.\n\n3) The command conforms to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. It specifies input and output in the correct order, sets the codec for the video correctly with `-c:v libvpx`, and uses `-preset realtime` which is valid. Bitrate is set using `-b:v 2M`, reflecting the users’ needs adequately.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation and successfully fulfills the user's request without errors in the command or adherence to the FFmpeg command structure."
