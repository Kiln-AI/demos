  "input": "I want to compress video.avi to MP4 using the h264 codec with the ultrafast preset",
  "output": "The ultrafast preset with H.264 is used for very fast encoding, sacrificing quality and increasing the file size for reduced encoding time. It is not suitable for lossless compression but useful for quick encoding, possibly in a live setting.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy -y output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation: `-c:v libx264` selects the H.264 codec for video compression. `-preset ultrafast` drastically lowers the encoding time by using a basic loop filter, lesser motion estimation, and coarser quantization step sizes. `-c:a copy` copies the original audio without re-encoding, assuming the quality is acceptable. The input AVI file is converted to an MP4 file while attempting to maintain the audio stream intact (`-y` forces overwriting without confirmation if output file exists). The ultrafast preset will not produce a final product suitable for high-quality viewing but can be useful for server-side quick encoding or in-progress editing where time is a concern.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the stated issue in the <issue_description>. The generated command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy -y output.mp4\n```\nis syntactically correct and uses the appropriate parameters for the specified task of compressing a video using the H.264 codec with the ultrafast preset. It follows the order of input and output specifications as required by FFmpeg.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing output example provided in <failure_example>. The failure example mentioned an invalid preset `extra_fast`, while the model used the valid preset `ultrafast`. Thus, it does not indicate any command generation error.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-i` for the input file, followed by output options (`-c:v`, `-preset`, `-c:a`, and `-y`), conforms to the structure outlined in the man page. All options are valid and properly applied.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should **pass**."
