  "input": "Combine `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file called `full_movie.mp4`. Make sure there are no re-encoding artifacts.",
  "output": "To concatenate `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file `full_movie.mp4` without re-encoding, use the `concat` filter. First, create a text file that lists the files to be concatenated.\n\nAssuming the input files have the same video and audio codecs, resolutions, and other properties.\n\n1. Create a text file `concat_list.txt` containing:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n2. Use the following `ffmpeg` command to concatenate the files:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -i concat_list.txt -c:v copy -c:a copy full_movie.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-f concat` specifies the input format as concatenation.\n- `-i concat_list.txt` is the text file containing the list of files to concatenate.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `full_movie.mp4` is the output file name.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly concatenates the video files without re-encoding them, which adheres to the user's request for combining `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file `full_movie.mp4` without introducing artifacts from re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The output command `ffmpeg -f concat -i concat_list.txt -c:v copy -c:a copy full_movie.mp4` is valid and correctly uses the concatenation feature in `ffmpeg` to join the files specified in `concat_list.txt`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly specifies the format as `concat`, uses a list of files as input, and applies the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options for video and audio streams respectively to avoid re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue and should pass the evaluation."
