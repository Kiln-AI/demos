    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output produced by the model fulfills the requirement by providing a valid command for transcoding input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding. The commands utilized are correctly formatted and the options used are valid as per the ffmpeg command line guidelines. Therefore, the output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example contains a command with an incorrect preset, whereas the output given here correctly applies the 2-pass encoding method using valid options and codec.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements set forth in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly follows the rules around options being applied to input and output files, and there are no syntax or option errors in the command. The pass number options and use of codecs are also compliant with the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass since it does not contain the issue. The commands are valid and appropriately formulated for the transcoding task as specified by the user."
