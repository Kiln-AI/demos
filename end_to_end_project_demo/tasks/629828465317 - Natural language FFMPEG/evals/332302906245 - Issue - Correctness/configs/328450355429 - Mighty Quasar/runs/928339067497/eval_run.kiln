  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract the video from stream 10 and the audio from stream 18 and merge them into a new file, use the map options in ffmpeg. -map 0:s::10 maps the video from stream 10 (stream specifier s::10 selects the 11th video stream), and -map 0:a:18 maps the audio from stream 18 (the 19th audio stream). This preserves original codecs unless you specify otherwise; if needed, you can re-encode video/audio.\n\nAssuming you want them muxed as-is (no encoding):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:s::10 -map 0:a:18 -c copy output.ts\n```\n\nIf you want to enforce codecs (e.g., H.264 video and AAC audio, common in TS):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:s::10 -map 0:a:18 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.ts\n```\n\nAssumption: You are using stream indices as referenced in ffprobe or ffmpeg -i output (streams are numbered starting from 0). Adjust the stream numbers if your file shows different stream numbers.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. It incorrectly uses `-map 0:s::10`, which suggests mapping a subtitle stream by specifying `s`, when the user specifically asked for video from stream 10. The mapping for video should use `v`, making it `-map 0:v:10`. This incorrect usage could lead to a failure in command execution when the user tries to run it.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example in that it will likely produce an error due to the misuse of the stream specifier. However, it does not entirely match the failure example since the overall structure of the command appears valid and contextually correct aside from the improper stream specifier.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page regarding the overall structure of `ffmpeg`, but the incorrect stream mapping could cause it to not behave as intended. Specifically, the mapping `-map 0:s::10` is incorrect for selecting a video stream, demonstrating misapplication of the mapping options.\n\n4) The model's output does contain an issue with the stream specification. Thus, it ultimately fails as it produces an incorrect command that does not fulfill the user's request accurately. The proper command should correctly specify the video stream using `v` instead of `s`."
