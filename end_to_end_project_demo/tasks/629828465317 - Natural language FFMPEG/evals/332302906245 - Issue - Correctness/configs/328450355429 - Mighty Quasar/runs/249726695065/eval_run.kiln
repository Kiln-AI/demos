  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "To merge multiple audio tracks into a single high-quality FLAC file, use the `amix` audio filter to blend the tracks and output them in a stereo mix. The `studio_master` is assumed to be a custom or high-quality configuration profile you've defined (note: standard FFmpeg doesn't include this preset for FLAC). The command below concatenates/merges inputs and encodes with lossless FLAC compression.\n\n- `amix=inputs=N:...` combines `N` audio inputs. Replace `N` with the total number of tracks. Assumes all inputs are in sync and audio-only (or use `-vn` if video is present).\n- `-f flac` ensures the output format is FLAC (required for compatibility).\n- `-compression_level 8` can be specified, but FLAC is always lossless, so \"high quality\" is inherently built-in if you keep the `-c:a flac` codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input1.wav -i input2.wav -i input3.wav -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first -f flac output.flac\n```\n\n**Assumptions made**:\n1. You're working with 3 audio input files (e.g., `input1.wav`, `input2.wav`, `input3.wav`). Adjust the `inputs=3` value accordingly.\n2. The goal is to merge them into a single 2-channel stereo FLAC using the first input's duration as reference. Feel free to change to `shortest` or omit the duration flag.\n3. You intended to use native FFmpeg methods; FLAC itself has no \"studio_master\" preset. If such a preset exists in your environment (e.g., via a custom script), re-run using `-preset studio_master` as an encoder option. \n\nTo achieve a stereophonic mix from multiple mono sources, ensure all inputs are mono or adjust the channel layout explicitly with `-channel_layout` if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command provided by the model assumes the use of a `studio_master` preset, which is not standard in FFmpeg. This could lead to confusion and potential failure if the preset does not exist.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model does follow a proper syntax for merging audio and specifies the use of `amix`, which is a correct filter. However, its reliance on a non-standard preset might cause issues.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the FFmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of the `amix` filter is valid and does not have any visible errors in relation to the options that are prescribed.\n\n4) Overall, the command produced does contain an issue because it references a non-standard preset without verifying its availability. This could potentially lead to execution failures. Therefore, the output should be marked as failing due to its assumption of the existence of a custom preset."
