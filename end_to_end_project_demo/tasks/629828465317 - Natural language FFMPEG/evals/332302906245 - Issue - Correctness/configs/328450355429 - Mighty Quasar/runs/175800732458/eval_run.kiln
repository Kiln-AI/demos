    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid and matches the user's request to convert a 4K video to a 1080p MP4 file while copying the audio stream without re-encoding it.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the failure example provided. The output command is properly structured and uses valid parameters, whereas the failure example included a nonexistent preset (`extra_fast`), which would cause an error.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does **not break any requirements** dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-vf \"scale=1920:1080\"` for resizing and `-c:a copy` for copying the audio stream is correct. The `-preset veryslow` is valid as it is one of the available presets for the encoder, and it follows the required option order.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should **pass** evaluation."
