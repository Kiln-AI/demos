  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert 5.1 surround sound to stereo with customized mixing, you can use the `-af` (audio filter) option with the `pan` filter. We'll mix the front left and right channels normally, and add the rear left (Lrs) and rear right (Rrs) channels at 50% volume into the stereo output.\n\nIn 5.1 channel order (ffmpeg uses standard channel layout): \n- FL = 0\n- FR = 1\n- FC = 2 (center)\n- LFE = 3 (subwoofer)\n- Lrs = 4 (rear left)\n- Rrs = 5 (rear right)\n\nThe rear channels will be added with 0.5 weight each to the corresponding stereo channels.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af \"pan=stereo|c0=FL+0.5*Lrs|c1=FR+0.5*Rrs\" -c:v copy output_stereo.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-af \"pan=stereo|c0=FL+0.5*Lrs|c1=FR+0.5*Rrs\"`: Mixes front left plus half volume rear left into left stereo channel, and front right plus half volume rear right into right stereo channel.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- Output file is `output_stereo.mp4`.\n\nAssumption: The input audio layout is standard 5.1 with channel order as above. If the input uses a different channel layout, you might need to specify `-channel_layout 5.1`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain an issue. The ffmpeg command generated correctly matches the user's request to convert a 5.1 surround audio to stereo while mixing the rear channels at 50% volume. The provided command structure is appropriate and aligns with the described function. Thus, it does not contain any errors that would prevent it from working correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model does not contain any invalid options or presets that do not exist, thus ensuring it is valid and should function as intended.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to the specifications outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The filters used and the command structure conform to the guidelines provided. There are no violations, such as incorrect ordering of options or invalid arguments. The parameters used (`-af`, `-c:v`, etc.) are correctly applied to the appropriate output stream.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation:**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the provided failure example, and complies with the requirements of the man page. Therefore, the evaluation indicates that the model's performance on this task is correct and satisfactory. It effectively transformed the user's request into a functional ffmpeg command."
