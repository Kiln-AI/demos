  "input": "Merge multiple audio tracks into one file using the studio_master preset and export as high-quality FLAC",
  "output": "The `ffmpeg` command for merging multiple audio tracks involves using the audio multiplexer (`-filter_complex`). We can combine several audio files into one by specifying them as streams (for example, `\"a\"` and `\"b\"`) and adjusting settings for the studio_master preset, high-quality FLAC format.\n\nHigh-quality FLAC encoding can be set using the `c:a flac` codec with a sampling rate of 48000kHz, ensuring it's in both stereo (stereo_2ch) and 16 bit (ktz short 16) for lossless compression. The `studio_master` option prioritizes compatibility, though it's not available in all versions of `ffmpeg`. If you're using a recent `ffmpeg`, you should omit this. Additionally, you'll need to provide the paths to each individual audio track file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i \"input_1.mp3\" -i \"input_2.wav\" -c:a flac -ac 2 -ar 48000kHz -b:a 900k -pix_fmt none -acodec spd-R128 -b:a 16000  -f wav -c:a spd-R128 -atcp 10 -stream_loop -1 -stream_list -2 -metadata stream=0 title=Alternative_1 -map 0 -map 1 -c:a studio_master -b:a 320 -ac 2 -ac 2 -ar 48000kHz -preset high -f flac output.flac\n```\nIn this command, we have multiple options:\n- `-c:a flac` and `-Z` mean that we are using FLAC.\n- `-ac 2` and `-ar 48000kHz` and `-b:a 900k` set high-quality audio settings for FLAC.\n- `-pix_fmt none -c:a spd-R128 -b:a 16000` adds multiple audio streams into one audio file.\n- `-stream_loop -1 -stream_list -2 -metadata stream=1 title=Alternative_1` tells ffmpeg to loop the single stream twice.\n- `-ac 2 -ac 2` again references stereo 2 channels for the combined audio.\n\nPlease note that this is one of the complex scenarios and might not work with all versions of FFmpeg due to the `studio_master` parameter which may be omitted or require codec or stream options that might not be available. The command was created based on your request, but you may need to tweak parameters based on the input tracks and the specific settings of the ffmpeg version you are using.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains significant issues that would likely lead to a non-functional FFmpeg command. It includes conflicting options and incorrect parameters that are not valid according to the FFmpeg syntax and man page documentation. For example, parameters like `-ar 48000kHz` are improperly formatted (should be `-ar 48000`), and the use of `-c:a studio_master` is problematic as \"studio_master\" is not a recognized audio codec or preset in FFmpeg. \n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example provided, as it contains ill-defined or non-existent options, which would cause the command to fail. The command is cluttered with redundant and non-functional options, leading to a high likelihood of failure when executed.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It contains options that are invalid or unnecessary, such as `-pix_fmt none` for an audio file, which is not applicable since pixel format pertains to video streams. Additionally, it misapplies several flags like `-stream_loop` and incorrectly specifies audio channel settings, which would result in confusion or errors.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output contains issues that would likely lead to non-functioning commands. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements for generating a correct FFmpeg command based on user input."
