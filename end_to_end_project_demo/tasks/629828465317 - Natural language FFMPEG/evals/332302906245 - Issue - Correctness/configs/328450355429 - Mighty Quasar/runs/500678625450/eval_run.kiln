  "input": "I need to convert a video file and set the bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps for archival purposes.",
  "output": "The request to set a bitrate of **64 Tbps (terabits per second)** is impractical, as this value is **orders of magnitude higher than any standard video bitrate** (even 4K/60fps videos typically use ~1–10 Gbps). It’s likely a typo or misunderstanding—common archival bitrates are in the range of **10–200 Mbps** (not Tbps). I’ll assume you meant **64 Mbps** and provide a command for high-quality archival encoding.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- You intended **64 Mbps** (not 64 Tbps).\n- Archival purposes require high quality and compatibility, so I’ll use lossless encoding (ProRes 422 HQ) and a container format suitable for long-term storage (MOV or MKV).\n\n### Command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v prores -profile:v 422hq -b:v 64M -an output.mov\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-c:v prores`: Uses Apple ProRes, a high-quality archival codec.\n- `-profile:v 422hq`: Selects the highest quality ProRes profile.\n- `-b:v 64M`: Sets the video bitrate to **64 Mbps** (adjustable if you meant a different value).\n- `-an`: Removes audio (if you don’t need it for archival; omit if required).\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Not needed for MOV, but ensures compatibility with some streaming workflows. For MKV, use `-c:a copy` instead.\n\nIf you *actually* need a **terabit per second** bitrate (e.g., for specialized scientific or high-speed imaging use cases), this would require **extreme hardware and infrastructure**, and `ffmpeg` cannot handle such values due to practical limitations. Please confirm the intended bitrate!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - Yes, the model addressed the impracticality of setting a bitrate to 64 Tbps and corrected it to 64 Mbps. However, it made an assumption without confirming the user’s intent. If the user actually needed a terabits per second bitrate (though unlikely), the command would not satisfy their requirement. The model identified the concern well, but the solution provided didn’t confirm the intended bitrate.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output does not resemble the failing example. The command generated is functional and syntactically correct, using valid options. It explains the choices made, and the codec profiles used are appropriate. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - No, the command does not break any requirements from the man page. The options used correspond correctly with the FFmpeg documentation. The command sets a video codec (`-c:v prores`), specifies the bitrate as 64 Mbps correctly with `-b:v 64M`, and other parameters used are valid.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output fails to confirm the user’s requirements correctly regarding the bitrate (assuming it was indeed supposed to be 64 Tbps), which could lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, it contains the issue described, and it should be evaluated as a fail in the context of verifying user inputs accurately."
