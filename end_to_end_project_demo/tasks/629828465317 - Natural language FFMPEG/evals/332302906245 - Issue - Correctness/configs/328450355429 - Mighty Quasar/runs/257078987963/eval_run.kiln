    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command accurately maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file, using the correct stream indices.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated by the model uses correct syntax for the `-map` option and does not contain any invalid options like the nonexistent `-preset extra_fast` from the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The use of `-map 0:v:1` and `-map 0:a:3` is appropriate for selecting the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the specified input file, which is in line with the mapping described in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, so it should pass."
