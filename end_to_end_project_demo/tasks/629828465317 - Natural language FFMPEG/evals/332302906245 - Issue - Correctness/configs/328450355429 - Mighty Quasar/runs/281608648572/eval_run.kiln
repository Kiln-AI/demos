  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, you can use the `vstack` filter in ffmpeg. This filter places one video on top of the other. Make sure both videos have the same width and pixel format; if not, you'll need to scale them or convert their pixel format accordingly.\n\nHere's the command assuming the videos have the same width and compatible formats:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"vstack=inputs=2\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k stacked.mp4\n```\n\nIf the widths differ, you might want to scale them to the same width first (for example, to 1280 pixels):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1280:-1[top];[1:v]scale=1280:-1[bottom];[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2[v]\" -map \"[v]\" -map 0:a? -map 1:a? -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k stacked.mp4\n```\n\nThis will scale both videos to 1280 width (height set automatically to preserve aspect ratio), stack them vertically, and include audio streams if present.\n\nAssumption: Both videos have audio streams; otherwise, remove the audio mapping or adjust accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command for stacking two videos vertically, using the `vstack` filter, is correct and aligns with the user's request. The explanations provided for handling scenarios when the input videos have different widths are also appropriate. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The command provided does not contain any invalid options or parameters that would cause it to fail. All options used in the command are valid and applicable according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax follows the general rules, and the parameters used are consistent with the expected usage for stacking videos. The command properly specifies inputs and applies filters in a way that is supported.\n\n4) Therefore, the output passes the evaluation criteria. The command is valid, aligns with the user's request, and does not contain issues related to the generation of ffmpeg commands."
