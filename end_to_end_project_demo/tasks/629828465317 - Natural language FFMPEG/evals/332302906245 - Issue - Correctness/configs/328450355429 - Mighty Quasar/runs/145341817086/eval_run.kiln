  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract the audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file while applying noise reduction, use the `noisereduce` audio filter. The `-coder 1` option enables experimental FLAC encoding settings (if available), though note that FLAC is typically a standard codec. The noise reduction filter uses default parameters (`window_size=10`, `strength=0.3`) for simplicity unless specified otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -coder 1 -filter:a noisereduce output.flac\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `-vn`: Disables video stream.  \n- `-c:a flac`: Specifies FLAC as the audio codec.  \n- `-coder 1`: Enables experimental FLAC encoding mode (if supported by your FFmpeg build).  \n- `-filter:a noisereduce`: Applies noise reduction to the audio. Default parameters are used unless adjusted.  \n- `output.flac`: The resulting file name. Adjust as needed.  \n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The FLAC encoder supports experimental settings (`-coder 1`).  \n- Default noise reduction parameters are acceptable (may require tuning for specific use cases).  \n- The input file is `video.mp4`, and the output should be named `output.flac` unless specified otherwise.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nYes, the output does contain an issue. The command generated includes the `-coder 1` flag, which is supposed to enable experimental encoding for FLAC. However, according to the FFmpeg documentation, while this option is documented, it is not typically necessary for the FLAC codec itself. Additionally, `-filter:a noisereduce` is incorrect as `noisereduce` is not a built-in FFmpeg filter. This output does not represent a command that is guaranteed to work correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nYes, the model's output resembles the failing output example. The presence of `-coder 1` suggests it may not function as intended, much like using a non-existent preset such as `-preset extra_fast`. Both results could lead to command failures.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nYes, the inclusion of the `-coder 1` is questionable. While not explicitly stated as invalid, it may not be necessary for the FLAC codec. Furthermore, using `-filter:a noisereduce`, which assumes a specific filter is available, could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the filter is not present in the FFmpeg build being used.\n\n4) **Final Assessment:**\n\nGiven these points, the model's output does contain issues concerning the validity and accuracy of the FFmpeg command generated, as it diverges from established documentation and could lead to errors. Therefore, it fails to meet the expectations set forth in the guidelines."
