  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "To maximize compatibility across all devices, it's common practice to create a \"dual codec\" output by encoding the video twice — once with libx264 (H.264) and once with libx265 (H.265/HEVC). This way, compatible devices that support H.265 can take advantage of better compression and quality, while legacy devices can fall back to H.264.\n\nSince ffmpeg generates single video streams, you'll need to create two separate outputs in one command: one using libx264 and another using libx265.\n\nKey points:\n- Use separate output files for each codec.\n- For H.264: use `-c:v libx264` with parameters known for compatibility (`-profile:v high -level:v 4.0`).\n- For H.265: use `-c:v libx265` with compatible profile and preset.\n- Copy audio stream as-is for both outputs.\n- Keep resolutions, frame rates, and other encoding defaults suitable for compatibility.\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` for MP4 files to enable faster streaming.\n\nAssuming input is `input.mp4`, output H.264 is `output_h264.mp4` and H.265 is `output_h265.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -map 0 -c:a copy \\\n  -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -level:v 4.0 -preset medium -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p \\\n  output_h264.mp4 \\\n  -map 0 -c:a copy \\\n  -c:v libx265 -preset medium -crf 28 -x265-params log-level=error -pix_fmt yuv420p \\\n  output_h265.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0` includes all streams (video, audio, subtitles) for each output.\n- `-c:a copy` preserves original audio (you may re-encode if needed).\n- H.264:\n  - `-profile:v high` and `-level:v 4.0` ensures good compatibility.\n  - `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for broad device support.\n- H.265:\n  - Same as above for compatibility.\n  - Adjusted `crf 28` as HEVC often requires higher CRF for balanced size/quality.\n  - `-x265-params log-level=error` to suppress unnecessary logs.\n  - Ensure `-preset medium` balances speed and quality.\n\nThis produces two files, each playable on compatible devices—legacy and modern. You can further optimize stretch-out if streaming is desired by adding `-movflags +faststart` to both outputs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command follows the FFmpeg syntax correctly and includes valid options for both libx264 and libx265 codecs without breaking any rules outlined in the man page. The use of options such as `-map`, `-c:a copy`, `-preset`, `-crf`, and `-pix_fmt` is appropriate for the task at hand.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is coherent, contains valid options, and should work without errors. The example provided has an explicit mistake with a non-existent preset, which is not present in this output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page of FFmpeg. The structure is correct according to the synopsis, and all options used are valid and applicable to the task described. The assumptions in terms of bitrate settings and pixel formats are reasonable and align with typical usage scenarios.\n\n4) Given the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue described; instead, it successfully generates a valid FFmpeg command that meets the requirements of dual codec output for video compatibility. Thus, the evaluation passes."
