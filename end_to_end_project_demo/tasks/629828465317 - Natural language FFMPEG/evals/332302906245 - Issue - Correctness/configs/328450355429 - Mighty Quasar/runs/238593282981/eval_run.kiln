  "input": "I want to use a video bitrate of 15000k and audio bitrate of 320k for my project.",
  "output": "To set specific bitrates for video (15000k) and audio (320k), you'll use constant bitrate encoding instead of quality-based encoding. This gives you precise control over file size and bandwidth requirements.\n\n- `-b:v 15000k` sets video bitrate to 15 Mbps (high quality, suitable for professional work)\n- `-b:a 320k` sets audio bitrate to 320 kbps (very high quality audio)\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio encoding\n- `-maxrate 15000k -bufsize 30000k` prevents bitrate spikes by setting maximum bitrate and buffer size\n\nI'm assuming you want to convert to MP4 format with H.264/AAC codecs (most common). If you need a different format or have a specific input file, please specify.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_file -c:v libx264 -b:v 15000k -maxrate 15000k -bufsize 30000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated correctly sets the specified video and audio bitrates according to the user's requirements and does not contain any invalid parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It correctly uses valid ffmpeg options and parameters, and there do not appear to be any typos or parameters that do not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are well-defined, and the order of options is correct according to the specification outlined in the man page. The specified settings for video and audio bitrates, as well as the codecs selected, are appropriate and supported.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue describedâ€”the command looks accurate and matches the user's requirements effectively. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation."
