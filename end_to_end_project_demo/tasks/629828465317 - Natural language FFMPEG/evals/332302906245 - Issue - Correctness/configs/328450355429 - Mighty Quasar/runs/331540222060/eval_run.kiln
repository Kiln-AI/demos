  "input": "Please convert my file.mov to MP4 using the vp9 codec with the ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert your file.mov to MP4 using the VP9 codec with the ultrafast preset, you can use ffmpeg’s libvpx-vp9 encoder. The -deadline ultrafast parameter is roughly equivalent to the ultrafast preset in ffmpeg’s libx264 (H.264 encoder), aiming for very fast encoding at the expense of compression efficiency.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want good browser support: VP9 in MP4 is supported by modern Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.\n- You want audio: AAC audio is generally a good match for MP4 and browser compatibility.\n\nExplanation of main options:\n- -c:v libvpx-vp9: Specifies the VP9 codec.\n- -deadline ultrafast: Sets the encoder speed to ultrafast (libvpx-vp9 equivalent to preset in libx264; note: slow down deadline for better compression).\n- -threads 4: Adjust this to your CPU cores (e.g., 8 or 16) for even faster encoding.\n- -crf 31: A medium quality CRF (VP9 uses a different scale from libx264; lower = higher quality; typical range 28–32).\n- -b:a 128k -c:a libvorbis: Encodes audio as Vorbis (Ogg codec) instead of AAC for maximum compatibility with browsers. If you need MP4 container, use AAC instead; consult your target browsers.\n- -movflags +faststart: Helps streaming (moves MP4 metadata to the start).\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -deadline ultrafast -crf 31 -threads 4 -b:a 128k -c:a libvorbis -movflags +faststart file_vp9.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need AAC audio instead of Vorbis (for strict MP4 and modern browser compatibility):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -deadline ultrafast -crf 31 -threads 4 -b:a 192k -c:a aac -movflags +faststart file_vp9.mp4\n```\n\nNote that VP9 encoding is generally slower than H.264, so even the ultrafast setting may be slower, but this maximizes your encoding speed for large jobs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as described. The command includes `-c:a libvorbis`, which is not compatible with the MP4 container format. The MP4 format typically supports AAC audio encoding, not Vorbis.\n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the failure example provided. The command generated is syntactically correct, though logically incorrect due to the use of an unsupported audio codec for the specified format.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page in terms of syntax, but it does employ an audio codec (Vorbis) that is not generally supported within the MP4 container format. Thus, while the syntax is correct, the logic regarding format compatibility is flawed. \n\n4) Given this analysis, the model's output fails to meet the requirements set by the user since it suggests an incompatible audio codec for the output format. Therefore, the overall evaluation of the model's performance in this case would be a 'fail'. The command generated would not work as expected because of the inclusion of `-c:a libvorbis` in a command meant to create an MP4 file."
