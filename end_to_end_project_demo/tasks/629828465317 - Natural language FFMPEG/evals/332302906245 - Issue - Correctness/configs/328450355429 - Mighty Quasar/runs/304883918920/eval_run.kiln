  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo add new subtitles to a video while also explicitly removing any existing subtitle tracks, you can do the following:\n\n- Use the -map option to map everything except existing subtitle streams, which ensures any existing subtitle tracks are excluded.\n- Assign -vf \"subtitles=subtitle_file.srt\" to burn the new subtitle text directly into the video (embedded in the frames), which is useful if you want hard subtitles.\n- Alternatively, if you want soft/external subtitles, you would remux or add a subtitle stream, but that's more complex. Here, we focus on burning subtitles.\n\nAssuming you have a subtitle file in SRT format, and your input video is input.mp4, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitle_file.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset fast -c:a copy -c:s mov_text -y output.mp4\n```\n\nThis approach adds the new subtitles as a separate subtitle stream, excluding all previous subtitle tracks, and copies audio and video streams (re-encoding video for compatibility). If instead you want to burn the subtitles into the video frames, replace -c:s mov_text with -vf \"subtitles=subtitle_file.srt\" and use -c:a copy to keep the audio.\n\nFor the approach you requested (explicitly removing all previous subtitles and adding a new one as soft subtitle), the command is as above. For embedded (burned) subtitle approach with removal of existing hard/soft subtitles, here's that alternative:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"subtitles=subtitle_file.srt\" -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -y output.mp4\n```\n\nIn this case, all existing subtitle tracks are implicitly removed, and new subtitles are burned into the video. Choice between the two depends on whether you want soft or hard subtitles.\n\nChoose the command that matches your use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to have the issue described. The commands generated correctly address the user's request to add subtitles while removing existing subtitle tracks. Although it provides two approaches (hard and soft subtitles), both are valid and formatted correctly according to FFmpeg's guidelines. The rationale and explanations preceding the commands also indicate a correct understanding of how to structure the command.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The commands produced are coherent and do not contain any obvious errors in syntax or options. The model correctly specifies codec parameters, mapping, and filtering options.\n\n3) Referring to the man page for FFmpeg, the command structures used in the model's output do not break any requirements. The usage of `-map` options seems to appropriately exclude existing subtitles, and the codecs selected (libx264 for video and mov_text for subtitles) are valid and correct. The command also adheres to the requirement for setting the order of options.\n\n4) Given the absence of errors in both the commands and their application in context, as well as meeting the requirements indicated in the man page, the modelâ€™s output does not contain the issues described. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
