  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "To apply temporal and spatial filters together in ffmpeg, you can chain filters in the -vf (video filter) option separated by commas. In your filter chain:\n\n- `yadif=mode=1` performs deinterlacing with temporal processing.\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the video to 1920x1080.\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0` sharpens the video spatially.\n\nThis chain ensures deinterlacing first, then scaling, then sharpening for best quality.\n\nAssuming your input file is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4`, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- The complex filter chain applies temporal (deinterlacing) and spatial (scaling and sharpening) processing.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream as-is without re-encoding.\n- `output.mp4` is the output file with processed video.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command accurately represents the user request for applying the specified filters in a valid ffmpeg format. It correctly synthesizes the userâ€™s needs into a working command that adheres to the requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is distinctly different from the failure example. The command produced is valid and does not contain erroneous parameters or misplaced options. It effectively applies the correct filters as per the user's original request.\n\n3) Reviewing the provided ffmpeg command against the requirements in the ffmpeg man page reveals that it adheres to all outlined guidelines. The order of options is correct, and the usage of the video filter option `-vf` is as expected. The parameters specified for the filters are valid and correctly formatted.\n\n4) Given that the model's output correctly formulates a working ffmpeg command without errors and matches the user's requirements accurately, it can be concluded that the model's performance in this instance is satisfactory. The command should function correctly and fulfill the user's needs."
