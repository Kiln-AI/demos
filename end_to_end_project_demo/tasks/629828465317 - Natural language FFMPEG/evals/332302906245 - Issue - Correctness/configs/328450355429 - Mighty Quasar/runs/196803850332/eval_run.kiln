  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To convert your video file so that the video bitrate is 50000 kbps (50 Mbps) and make it web-ready, you can use the -b:v 50000k option with H.264 video encoding. Additionally, encoding with AAC audio at a reasonable bitrate and setting -movflags +faststart optimizes the MP4 for instant streaming in web browsers.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is named input.mp4.\n- You want to output to output.mp4.\n- You want H.264 encoding.\n- Audio bitrate is set to 128k (adjust as needed).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v libx264: Uses H.264 for video.\n- -b:v 50000k: Sets video bitrate to 50 Mbps.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k: Encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart: Places metadata at the start for progressive/buffered playback.\n  \nThis will give you a web-ready MP4 video with the specified video bitrate using efficient codecs for broad compatibility.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be correct and adheres to the user's request for a video file conversion with a specific video bitrate and web-ready format.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4` is valid as it uses proper syntax and known parameters from the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used in the command are correctly applied, and each option serves its intended purpose according to the ffmpeg documentation:\n   - `-c:v libx264` specifies the use of the H.264 video codec.\n   - `-b:v 50000k` sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps.\n   - `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` specifies AAC audio encoding with a bitrate of 128 kbps.\n   - `-movflags +faststart` helps optimize the MP4 file for streaming.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, and therefore it should **pass** the evaluation."
