  "input": "Convert input.mov to MP4 with H.265 encoding using the super_slow preset for best compression",
  "output": "To convert input.mov to an MP4 file with H.265 (HEVC) video encoding and use the super_slow preset for maximum compression efficiency, specify libx265 as the video codec and set -preset super_slow. H.265 offers better compression than H.264. Note that not all browsers/devices support H.265 playback, so this is ideal for storage or controlled environments.\n\n- -c:v libx265 selects the H.265 codec.\n- -preset super_slow prioritizes compression efficiency over encoding speed (best for archiving, less suitable for real-time workflows).\n- -crf 28 is the recommended quality-based variable bitrate setting for H.265 (adjust lower for higher quality).\n- -c:a copy preserves the original audio stream (since H.265 only affects video), but you can re-encode with AAC if preferred.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -preset super_slow -crf 28 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: The source audio is compatible with MP4. If you need to re-encode audio to ensure compatibility, replace -c:a copy with -c:a aac -b:a 128k.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command appears to be correctly structured and applicable according to the requirements set out in the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command provided does not contain any nonexistent preset option (like `extra_fast`), and the parameters used (like `libx265` and `super_slow`) are valid for ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are correctly applied to the video output, and the order of options is maintained as required by ffmpeg. Specifically, the use of `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-crf`, `-c:a`, and `-pix_fmt` complies with the expected usage in the command line syntax described in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described; therefore, it should pass the evaluation. The generated command is correct and matches the user's request."
