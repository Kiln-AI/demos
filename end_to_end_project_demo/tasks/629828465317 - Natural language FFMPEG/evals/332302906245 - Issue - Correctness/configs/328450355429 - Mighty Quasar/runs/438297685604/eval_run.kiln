  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nStabilizing a shaky video with the `deshake` filter can help reduce camera shake while aiming to keep the result smooth and natural. The `deshake` filter works by analyzing the video and applying a stabilization effect. However, it does not always produce perfect results, and often a combination with the `deshake` and `crop` filters is used to crop away the areas moved outside the frame by stabilization.\n\nKey parameters:\n- `deshake` applies the stabilization.\n- `crop` may be used to remove black borders or to keep a tighter crop after stabilization (you can adjust these parameters based on your need).\n- `-preset` and `-crf` are helpful for balancing speed and quality if re-encoding with H.264 for output (adjustable).\n\nThis example includes stabilization and crops a bit for a nicer framing (assuming you want to keep the details tightly around the scene after stabilization):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake,crop=in_w-stb:in_h-stb -c:a copy stabilized_output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `deshake` applies the filter for stabilization.\n- `crop=in_w-stb:in_h-stb` crops the frame by the detected stabilization borders (this prevents black bars and keeps framing stable but slightly tighter).\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio as-is, assuming existing codec is supported.\n\nFor a more controlled and natural, slower, and higher quality stabilization, you may consider `deshake` with the `-crop` filter and a slower ` -preset` with fine-tuned `crf` values.\n\nIf fine details and quality are a priority, you may also consider using the `deshake` or `transform` filter with the `vidstabtransform` method from the `vidstabilize` filter, which is more advanced and slower but has better results in many cases.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here?\nThe model's output appears to meet the requirements of the task by providing a valid `ffmpeg` command. It also explains the parameters used in the command. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output? \nThe output is not similar to the failing output example because it provides a proper command with valid filters and parameters. It does not include any erroneous presets or similar mistakes.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command adheres to the requirements of the `ffmpeg` man page and does not appear to violate any guidelines as it correctly applies the `-vf` option for filters and keeps the audio unchanged with `-c:a copy`.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, as it successfully generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's request for video stabilization with the `deshake` filter. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation."
