  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply a brightness filter, contrast filter, and resize the video to 1080p, you can chain the filters using FFmpeg's `filter_complex` option. The brightness and contrast filters adjust the visual tone, while the scale filter resizes the video. The order of filters matters, as each subsequent filter acts on the output of the previous one. \n\n- `brightness=0.1`: Adjusts brightness (positive values increase brightness, negative decrease). You can modify the value as needed.\n- `contrast=1.5`: Adjusts contrast (values >1 increase contrast, values <1 reduce it). Adjust this parameter based on your preference.\n- `scale=1920:1080`: Resizes the video to 1080p resolution (1920Ã—1080). If you want to maintain the original aspect ratio, use `scale=-2:1080` to let FFmpeg calculate the width proportionally.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"brightness=0.1,contrast=1.5,scale=1920:1080\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file is in a format compatible with FFmpeg (e.g., MP4, AVI, etc.).  \n- Audio is not modified; if you want to adjust audio, additional parameters like `-c:a copy` or `af` filters could be added.  \n- The scale filter uses exact 1920Ã—1080 dimensions. For aspect ratio preservation, use `scale=-2:1080` instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command appears to be syntactically correct and matches the user's request for a brightness filter, a contrast filter, and a resizing operation to 1080p. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output because the command does not contain any invalid or non-existent options. The filters used (brightness and contrast) are valid, and the scaling to 1080p (1920:1080) is also appropriate.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses the `-vf` option to apply a sequence of video filters, ensuring the filters are applied in the right order. The syntax for combining these filters is valid, and the scaling resolution is set correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **pass** as it does not contain the issues described. The FFmpeg command is sound, fulfilling the user's request accurately."
