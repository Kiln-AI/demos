  "output": "To quickly convert `movie.mkv` to MP4, use the `ultrafast2` preset with the H.264 video codec and AAC audio. This prioritizes encoding speed over quality/file size.  The `-movflags +faststart` option is included to optimize the file for streaming.  A CRF value has to be specified, and I chose 23 as a reasonable default.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is valid and fits the requirements stated in the user message: converting a video file from MKV to MP4 using the `ultrafast` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not utilize a nonexistent preset name, nor does it contain errors that would lead to command failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used in the command (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-crf`, `-c:a`, and `-movflags`) are all valid and correctly implemented according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a correct and functional command for the transformation requested by the user. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
