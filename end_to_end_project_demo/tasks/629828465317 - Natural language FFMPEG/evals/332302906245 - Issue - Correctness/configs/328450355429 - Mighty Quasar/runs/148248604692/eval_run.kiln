  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "Certainly! To select specific streams by their original file stream indices, you can use the -map option. Here, you want to extract video stream #12 and audio stream #25 from recording.mkv.\n\n- -map 0:v:12 selects the 13th video stream (counting from 0).\n- -map 0:a:25 selects the 26th audio stream (counting from 0).\n- -c copy copies the streams without re-encoding.\n\nNote: If your file doesnâ€™t have that many streams, ffmpeg will error out. You may want to run ffprobe first to verify the total number of streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command will create a new MKV containing just those two selected streams. If you want a different output format, change output.mkv to your desired filename/extension.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is structured correctly and should work for selecting streams from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv`) does not contain any invalid options or commands, unlike the example provided where an invalid preset was used (`-preset extra_fast`).\n\n3) Reviewing the command against the ffmpeg man page reveals no violations. The command correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select specific video and audio streams from the input file, aligns with the format requirements, and uses the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any issues that would prevent it from working as intended, and the command adheres to the requirements stated in the user input. Thus, it would pass the evaluation."
