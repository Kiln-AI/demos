  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "Using the deshake filter in ffmpeg is an efficient way to stabilize shaky video frames by using motion vectors predicted from one frame to the next. This filter works well if the motion is limited to horizontal or vertical pixel movements and the camera's vertical angle did not change much throughout the video.\n\nHere are the key points for using deshake:\n\n- The deshake filter uses motion vectors tracked over time to make the image look smoother by moving the video frames in the opposite direction to the camera shake. It depends on enough frames for precise correction.\n- It can only correct horizontal (x)-shaking; if the shaking has vertical (y)-components, a different method (like ` MotionVectorCompensator`) would be needed.\n- No need to specify pixels or parameters explicitly if default settings are acceptable.\n\nAssuming your shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4` is a typical case with only horizontal shaking, the following command applies the deshake filter:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=F=1\" -c:a copy stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-vf \"deshake=F=1\"` applies the deshake filter to the input video.\n- The value `F=1` depends on whether you want front or back plate (0 = front, 1 = back). For shaky video with strong horizontal motion, front plate is often more effective.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Output file named `stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4`.\n\nIf you're unsure, you can also try changing `F=1` to 0 for back plate (slightly different deshake effect).\n\nThis will output a more stabilized, smoother video for you!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n- The model's output does not contain the specified issue. The generated command appears to be valid and correctly utilizes the `deshake` filter to stabilize the shaky video as requested. It provides the appropriate parameters and the input/output files are named correctly per the user request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n- No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example, as it does not contain any incorrect or unsupported options. The command is formatted properly and utilizes the `deshake` filter correctly.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n- The command does not break any requirements outlined in the man page. The `-vf` option is used properly to apply the video filter, and the command structure follows the required syntax of specifying the input file, applying the filter, and defining the output file.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n- The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command works correctly, matches the user's requirement, and adheres to the syntax and options dictated in the ffmpeg man page. This output should be considered a successful generation of the command."
