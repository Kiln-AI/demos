  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode the subtitles into the video, you can use the `sub_file` filter in FFmpeg. This filter allows you to overlay subtitles on top of the video.\n\n- `sub_file subtitles.srt` specifies the subtitle file to use.\n- `fontcolor=yellow` sets the color of the subtitles.\n- `forced_style='Fontsize=24'` sets the font size of the subtitles (you can adjust this value to your preference).\n\nAssuming the input video has a compatible format (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC for audio) for output without re-encoding, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:fontsdir=/usr/share/fonts/truetype:force_style='Fontsize=24,PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF&'\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nHowever, the more concise and commonly recommended approach which will automatically override the font directory and uses `yellow` as specified in the query is:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt:fontcolor=yellow -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nNote: The command assumes that the font size is acceptable and in the default range. Adjust as necessary based on your requirements.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the described issue. The command provided appears to be correctly formatted and meets the user’s requirement to hardcode subtitles into the video with the specified color (yellow). The command uses the `subtitles` filter appropriately and sets the font color as requested.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not have any obvious syntax errors or use any non-existent options. The command utilizes a valid filter for hardcoding subtitles and sets the font color correctly.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used in the command are consistent with those defined in the FFmpeg documentation. The use of the `-vf` parameter for applying video filters like `subtitles` is correct, and setting the color with `fontcolor=yellow` is valid in terms of filter parameters.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should be evaluated as **pass**. The output is correct, and it successfully addresses the user’s request for hardcoding yellow subtitles into the video file."
