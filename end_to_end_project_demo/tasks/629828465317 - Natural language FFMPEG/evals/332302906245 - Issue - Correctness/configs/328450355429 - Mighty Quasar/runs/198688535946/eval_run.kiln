  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map only the third audio stream while keeping the original video, use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`.  `-map 0:v` maps all video streams from the input file, and `-map 0:a:2` maps the third audio stream (index 2, since indexing starts at 0). The `-c copy` argument will ensure the streams are copied without re-encoding, preserving the original quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select the original video (`-map 0:v`) and the specified third audio track (`-map 0:a:2`), which matches the user's requirement of keeping the original video and mapping only the third audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and follows the structure dictated by `ffmpeg`. There are no errors or nonexistent options in the command.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options used are correctly applied, without conflicting definitions, and they adhere to the expected syntax for stream mapping and copying streams.\n\n4) Given that the command fulfills the user's requirements without any issues, the model's output should pass."
