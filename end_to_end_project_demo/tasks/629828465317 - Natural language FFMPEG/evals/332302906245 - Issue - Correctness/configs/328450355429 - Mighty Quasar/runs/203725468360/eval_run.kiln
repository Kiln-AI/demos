  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect on your video using FFmpeg, you need to chain multiple video filters using the -vf (or -filter_complex for more complex cases) option. Filters are applied in the order you specify. For example, to first apply a Gaussian blur and then overlay text, you’d use the vidstab “boxblur” or “gblur” filter for blurring, then use “drawtext” for the text overlay.\n\nHere’s how you do it properly with chained filters:\n\n- boxblur or gblur applies the blur effect.\n- drawtext overlays the text onto the blurred video.\n- Use colons (:) to separate options inside a filter, and commas (,) to chain filters.\n\nAssumptions: \n- You want the text in the top-left corner. Adjust drawtext parameters as needed.\n- The font \"Arial\" is available. Change as necessary for your system.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"gblur=sigma=10,drawtext=fontfile=/path/to/arial.ttf:text='Sample Text':x=10:y=10:fontsize=24:fontcolor=white\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- gblur=sigma=10 applies a strong Gaussian blur. Adjust sigma for more/less blur.\n- drawtext overlays \"Sample Text\" at (10,10) coordinates.\n- -c:a copy preserves the original audio.\n\nIf you want to overlay text first, then blur both video and text (less common), just switch the order: drawtext=...,gblur=...\n\nYou can chain as many filters as needed, just separate each filter with a comma inside the -vf quotes.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is valid and should work correctly for overlaying text and applying a blur effect on a video, which matches the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is properly formatted and does not include any non-existent parameters or incorrect usage of FFmpeg options.\n\n3) Based on the FFmpeg man page, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements. It correctly chains video filters (gblur and drawtext) using proper syntax, and the options used for those filters are valid and well-defined.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described and follows the correct structure and requirements, it passes the evaluation. The command should function as intended when executed in FFmpeg."
