  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from a video every 2 seconds, you can use the `fps` filter in `ffmpeg`, which controls the frames per second. Since we want extremely high resolution PNGs, we must consider the video's dimensions and use a scaler that allows fine-grained control over the output size.\n\nHowever, due to the enormous file size of ultra high-resolution images, a one-size-fits-all pixel specification isn't practical in this context. We'll assume a resolution that scales well for high-quality images (e.g., X720P for extremely high resolutions like actual \"Ultra High\" may result in very large file sizes).\n\nBefore running the command, you'll need to determine the video's original resolution. Once you've obtained it, you can use a scaler that suits your resolution goal. For the sake of this example, let's assume you want 7680x4320 (Ultra-High Definition) PNG images at a 2-second interval.\n\nHere's the FFmpeg command, assuming the input video's resolution is something you can upscale to without distorting (for HD to UHD scaling, this is the common relationship, but not applicable for each specific pair of resolutions):\n\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf fps=2,scale=w=7680:h=4320:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease -vsync vfr -q:v 2 -qmin 2 input_%d.png\n```\n\nIn this command, the `-vf` option specifies a complex filter graph that includes `fps=2` which tells FFmpeg to process two frames per second (hence, extracting one every 2 seconds), and `scale=w=7680:h=4320:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease` that attempts to scale the video to 7680x4320 resolution. The `-vsync vfr` syncs the frame extraction accordingly, and the `-q:v 2 -qmin 2` sets the quality of the output PNG images to be very high. The extracted frames are saved with the `%d.png` template, which will be replaced by FFmpeg with incremental frame numbers starting from 0 (we'll actually start from 1, hence the base assumption for clarity).\n\nPlease note that if the assumption about scaling is incorrect, or scale to UHD resolution is not feasible given the video's original resolution, you'll need to adjust the `-vf scale` filter to match the video's original resolution or to go to a higher resolution that respects the original video's constraints.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command it generated seems appropriate for the task of extracting frames from a video every 2 seconds and saving them as PNG images. The command uses valid parameters and options that align with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any non-existent options like `preset extra_fast`. Instead, it utilizes valid and recognized options for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the command in the context of the FFmpeg man page, it appears that the command does meet the necessary requirements. Each option is correctly applied to the specified input/output file, and the order of parameters adheres to FFmpeg's command-line syntax. There are no violations of the options or their intended applications.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it produced is valid for extracting frames from the video, matches the user requirements, and does not contain errors in its construction. Hence, the evaluation would pass."
