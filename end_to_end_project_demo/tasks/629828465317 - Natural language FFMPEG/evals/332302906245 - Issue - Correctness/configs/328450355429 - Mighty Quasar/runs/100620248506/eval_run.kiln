  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio and video filters together. Use -vf 'scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0' -af 'volume=2.0,highpass=f=200' to scale, sharpen, increase volume and apply high-pass filter.",
  "output": "To apply multiple filters to video and audio streams simultaneously, you can specify multiple filters separated by commas within the `-vf` and `-af` parameters. This allows you to perform sequential operations like scaling, sharpening, volume adjustment, and high-pass filtering in one command.\n\n- The video filter (`-vf`) scales the video to 640x480 and sharpens it with `unsharp`.\n- The audio filter (`-af`) doubles the volume and applies a high-pass filter with a cutoff frequency of 200Hz.\n\nAssuming the input file is named `input.ext` and the output is `output.ext`, here is the ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -vf \"scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0\" -af \"volume=2.0,highpass=f=200\" output.ext\n```\n\nReplace `input.ext` and `output.ext` with your actual filenames and extensions as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is valid and correctly matches the user requirements for applying multiple audio and video filters using `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided correctly uses existing and valid options (`-vf` and `-af`) and does not contain any mistakes like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly applies input and output options in the expected order, and the parameters for both the video filter (`-vf`) and audio filter (`-af`) are valid as per the `ffmpeg` specifications.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is valid and fulfills the user's request without issues, so it passes the evaluation."
