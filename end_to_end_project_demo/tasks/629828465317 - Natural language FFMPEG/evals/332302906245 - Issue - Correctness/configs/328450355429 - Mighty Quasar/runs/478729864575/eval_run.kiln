  "output": "To map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from an input file (input.mov), you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. This allows you to explicitly select specific streams from the input file.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (streams are zero-indexed, so index 6 is the 7th).\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream (index 13 is the 14th).\n- The output format is determined by the file extension, so using `output.mp4` assumes MP4 format, which is widely supported.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- The input file contains at least 14 audio streams and 7 video streams.\n- The output format is MP4, as indicated by the file extension.\n- You want to retain the original codec settings for the selected streams unless otherwise specified.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the specified issue. The command it generated correctly fulfills the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from the input file to the output. The use of the `-map` option allows for explicit stream selection, and the command appears to be well-formed and functionally correct for its intended purpose.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is valid and adheres to how `ffmpeg` is supposed to operate, unlike the failing example which includes an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select specific streams by their zero-based index without any violations of syntax or usage rules provided by `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the model's output does not contain any issues as described, and it adheres to the requirements laid out in the `ffmpeg` man page. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
