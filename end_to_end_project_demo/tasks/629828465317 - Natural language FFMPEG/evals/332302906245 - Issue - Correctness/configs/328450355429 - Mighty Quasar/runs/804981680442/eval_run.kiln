  "output": "Certainly! To select specific streams in ffmpeg, you use the `-map` option with stream specifiers.\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the **second video stream** (streams are zero-indexed, so 1 means the second).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the **fourth audio stream** (index 3).\n- `0:` refers to the first input file (complex.avi in this case).\n\nThis command simply copies the selected streams into the output without re-encoding, preserving quality and making the process fast.\n\nAssumption: You want to keep the codecs unchangedâ€”add `-c copy`. If you want to transcode, adjust the `-c:v` and `-c:a` options.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output_selected_streams.avi\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command appears to be correct given the user request to map specific streams from a source file, using the `-map` option appropriately along with `-c copy` to retain the original streams without re-encoding. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output example. The command provided uses valid ffmpeg options for mapping streams and does not include any invalid parameters or nonexistent values, such as `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist. \n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It adheres to the correct syntax for specifying input streams and preserves the properties of those streams by using `-c copy`. The `-map` options used are standard for selecting specific streams from the input file.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the evaluation of output commands, as it successfully generates a valid and actionable ffmpeg command based on the user's request. Therefore, it should pass evaluation."
