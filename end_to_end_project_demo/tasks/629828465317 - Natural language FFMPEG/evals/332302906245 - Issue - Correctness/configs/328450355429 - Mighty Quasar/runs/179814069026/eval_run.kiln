  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "AVI container does not natively support the VP9 codec properly and may cause compatibility issues. However, if you specifically want to encode the video stream using libvpx-vp9 codec and output to AVI despite limited support, the 2-pass encoding process involves two sequential ffmpeg commands: one to analyze and store stats, and the second to do the actual encoding using the stats.\n\nHere is how you can do it:\n\nFirst pass (no audio, output to null, record stats):\n- Pass 1 with -pass 1 and -an to disable audio.\n- Output to null or a temporary file for analysis.\n\nSecond pass (use stats from pass1, encode video and audio):\n- Pass 2 with -pass 2.\n- Include audio encoding with a compatible codec (like mp3 or pcm since AVI may not support opus or aac).\n\nAssumptions:\n- Audio codec is set to mp3 for compatibility in AVI containers.\n- You want a reasonably good quality with a defined bitrate (example 1000k).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1000k -pass 1 -an -f avi NUL\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 1000k -pass 2 -c:a libmp3lame output.avi\n```\n\nNote for UNIX systems, replace `NUL` with `/dev/null`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue?**\n   The output contains an issue because it suggests transcoding to an AVI container using the VP9 codec. AVI does not have good support for VP9, which may lead to compatibility problems. Thus, the command may not work as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   While the output doesn't contain a syntactical error like the given failure example (e.g., using a wrong preset that doesn't exist), it does imply an operational fault by suggesting the use of an incompatible codec with the specified container format. This is indeed a significant issue but not directly similar to the failing output format presented in the example.\n\n3) **Does the command break requirements from the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax and structure of the commands are correct and follow the intended usage of FFmpeg. The model correctly applies two-pass encoding concepts and includes relevant options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains the issue described, as it suggests using an incompatible codec for the AVI container format, which may lead to compatibility problems. Hence, it should fail due to this critical mistake."
