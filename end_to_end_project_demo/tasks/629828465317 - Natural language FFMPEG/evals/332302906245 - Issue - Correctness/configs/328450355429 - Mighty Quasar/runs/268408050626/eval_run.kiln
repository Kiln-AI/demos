  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize the shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4` using the `deshake` filter, FFmpeg automatically detects movement and applies stabilization. The `strength` parameter controls the intensity of correction (higher values = more aggressive stabilization), and `detect=1` enables automatic motion detection. Since the user didnâ€™t specify a strength value, a moderate default (`strength=3`) is used. The audio is copied unchanged to preserve quality and save processing time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=strength=3:detect=1\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The video uses a standard codec (e.g., H.264) compatible with re-encoding.  \n- Audio quality remains unchanged (`-c:a copy`).  \n- No additional frame rate or resolution adjustments are needed.  \n- A moderate stabilization strength (`3`) is sufficient for most cases.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The `ffmpeg` command produced by the model appears to be correctly formatted and utilizes the appropriate `deshake` filter along with the relevant parameters. The command should work correctly for stabilizing the video, assuming the input file is compatible.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example given. The command `ffmpeg -i input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails due to a non-existent preset. In contrast, the command generated by the model uses valid parameters and a filter that exists in `ffmpeg`, and thus it should execute without errors.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used (like `-vf` for video filters and `-c:a copy` for copying the audio codec) conform to the prescribed command format. The `deshake` filter parameters appear correct based on the provided input.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is valid and should perform the required stabilization of the video `bumpy_ride.mp4` using the `deshake` filter according to the specifications set out in the user's request. Thus, the evaluation passes."
