  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a multi-track MKV file, use the `-map` option to select the desired streams by their index. This assumes stream indexes are zero-based and corresponds directly to MKV track numbers listed by `ffprobe`.\n\n- `-map 0:v:15` selects the 15th video stream from the input (`source.mkv`).\n- `-map 0:a:22` selects the 22nd audio stream from the input.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (preserving quality).\n- If the output format (e.g., MP4) does not support the original codecs, re-encode with `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` before using `-c copy`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Stream indexes in `source.mkv` are zero-based (track 15 corresponds to index 15).  \n- Codecs of the selected streams are compatible with the output container (MP4). If not, adjust with `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` to ensure compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output provides a valid `ffmpeg` command to select specific video and audio streams from the input file `source.mkv`, using the `-map` option correctly and employing `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding. There are no errors in the command syntax nor misuse of options. Therefore, the output accurately meets the user's requirements and does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model is structured correctly and utilizes existing options appropriately. The command does not include any invalid option (e.g., a non-existent `preset`).\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command follows the requirements laid out in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The model specifies input with `-i`, correctly uses `-map` to select the video and audio streams, and utilizes the option `-c copy` to copy the selected streams directly to the output file. The command adheres to the expected order of options and syntax, meaning it does not violate any specified requirements.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described and it should pass the evaluation. The command is correct and matches the user's requirements without any syntax errors or misuse of parameters."
