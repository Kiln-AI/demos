  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress video.mov very quickly, use the libx264 encoder with the `-preset ultrafast` (the fastest built-in x264 preset). This reduces compression efficiency but speeds up encoding drastically. The audio can be copied to avoid re-encoding and save time.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a copy compressed_video.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Output format chosen as MP4 to ensure compatibility.\n- The hyper preset you referred to is approximated here by `ultrafast` since ffmpeg’s libx264 presets do not include a \"hyper\" preset; ultrafast is the fastest option.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated appears to be correct and meets the user's requirements—effectively compressing the video with the `ultrafast` preset while avoiding unnecessary re-encoding of audio.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. In the output, the model used the correct preset name (`ultrafast`) without introducing any non-existent parameters, which suggests it is a valid command, while the failure example had a nonexistent preset name (`extra_fast`).\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly follows the convention of specifying the input and output files and correctly applies the video and audio codec options. \n\n4) Since the command generated by the model is valid and executes the requested operation correctly according to the user's input and the information from the ffmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation criteria."
