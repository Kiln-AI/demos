    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake\" stabilized_video.mp4`) is appropriate and should work correctly for stabilizing the video using the `deshake` filter. Therefore, it successfully meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not use an invalid option or parameter like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist. The usage of `-vf \"deshake\"` is correct, so it does not reflect a malfunction like the example given in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax follows the expected format: specifying the input file with `-i`, applying the video filter `-vf`, and giving the output filename at the end. There is nothing in the command that violates the usage rules outlined.\n\n4) Since the model's output correctly addresses the user's request without any issues, it should pass the evaluation."
