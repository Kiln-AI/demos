  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To overlay a semi-transparent watermark on the bottom left corner of a video, you can use the `overlay` filter together with the `format` and `colorchannelmixer` filters to adjust the watermark's transparency. The `format=rgba` ensures the logo's alpha channel is preserved, and `colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5` sets the alpha (opacity) to 50%. Positioning at `x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h` places the watermark at the bottom left.\n\nHere's the command assuming you want to retain the original codec settings but re-encode due to overlay:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[wm];[0][wm]overlay=x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.avi` is your main video.\n- `-i logo.png` is the watermark image.\n- `[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[wm]` converts the logo to support alpha and sets its opacity to 50%.\n- `[0][wm]overlay=x=0:y=main_h-overlay_h` overlays the watermark onto the main video at the bottom-left corner.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- The output is `output.mp4` in MP4 format (since the video is re-encoded, MP4 is a common container choice).\n\nIf you want the original format, change output filename and codec accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to meet the userâ€™s request adequately by applying a watermark with specified transparency to the bottom left corner of the video, making sense of order and the parameters used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command provided seems to be valid and uses recognized options for ffmpeg, such as `overlay`, `format`, and `colorchannelmixer`. None of the options used are incorrect or do not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The sequence and format of options and filters in the command line is correctly structured and adheres to the rules set out in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command and does not contain any mistakes or unsupported options, it should pass the evaluation. The command fulfills the user's requirement for adding a semi-transparent watermark to the video."
