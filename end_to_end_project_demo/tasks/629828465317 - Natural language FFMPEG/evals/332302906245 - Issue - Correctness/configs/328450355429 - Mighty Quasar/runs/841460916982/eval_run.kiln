  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from your video and save them as ultra-high-resolution PNG images, you can use the `ffmpeg` command below. I'm assuming that \"ultra high resolution\" refers to maintaining the original resolution of the video, as opposed to upscaling it. If you actually want to increase the resolution, specify the desired resolution using the scale filter.\n\nThe key parameters are:\n\n-   `-i video.avi`: Specifies the input video file.\n-   `-vf \"select=not(mod(n\\,fps*2)), scale=iw*4:ih*4\"`: This complex filter does two things:\n    *   `select=not(mod(n\\,fps*2))`: Selects frames based on the frame number `n` and the video's frame rate `fps`. `fps*2` calculates the number of frames per 2 seconds. `mod(n,fps*2)` calculates the remainder when the frame number is divided by the number of frames per 2 seconds. `not()` inverts the result, so a frame will be selected every 2 seconds.\n    *   `scale=iw*4:ih*4`: Scale the image to 4 times the original dimensions.\n-   `-vsync vfr` This is important, without this ffmpeg might miss some frames or duplicate others.\n-   `output_%04d.png`: Specifies the output file name pattern. `%04d` is a placeholder for a 4-digit sequence number, creating files like `output_0001.png`, `output_0002.png`, etc. The `.png` extension ensures that the images are saved in PNG format, which is lossless and preserves fine details.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"select=not(mod(n\\,fps*2)), scale=iw*4:ih*4\" -vsync vfr output_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue as it incorrectly modifies the `scale` parameter, scaling the image to 4 times the original dimensions. The user explicitly requested ultra high resolution, which can be reasonably interpreted as retaining the original resolution without upscale. The scaling step may have introduced a resolution that exceeds the original, which was not requested.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, as it does not include any option that is invalid according to the ffmpeg documentation (like a non-existent preset). Rather, it contains accurate commands but misapplied parameters.\n\n3) The command does not explicitly break any requirements dictated in the man page, but it uses `scale=iw*4:ih*4`, which may not comply with the user's intention to extract frames at original resolution. \n\nIn summary, the model's output correctly follows the syntax and command structure of ffmpeg, but misinterprets the original request for \"ultra high resolution\" by suggesting an unnecessary upscale. The user should have received a command that extracts frames at the original resolution. Thus, the evaluation should conclude that although the command might execute without error, it does not fulfill the user's request as intended."
