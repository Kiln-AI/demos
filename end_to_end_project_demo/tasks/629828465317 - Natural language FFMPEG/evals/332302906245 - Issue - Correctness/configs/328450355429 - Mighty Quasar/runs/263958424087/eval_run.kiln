  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "**Assumptions:** I assumed you're familiar with 2-pass encoding and its use cases. 2-pass encoding is a technique used with VP9 and VP8 codecs to adjust bitrate according to the content. However, VP9 is not typically used with AVI containers.\n\nTo transcode `input.mp4` to AVI, I will use the following parameters:\n\n- `libx264` for encoding H.264 video\n- `-c:v libx264` to specify H.264 video codec\n- `-pass 1` to indicate the start of the first pass\n- `-pass 2` to indicate the start of the second pass\n- `-passlog error.log 2>&1` to write a log of errors from the second pass\n- `-b:v 2000k 2` to specify a constant bitrate (2000 k in size) and a high-pass mode (required for 2-pass encoding)\n- `-fixed_ips 1` to enable fixed-ips (set the width and height)\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older AVI\n\nHowever, the VP9 codec is typically used with the WebM container. So, transcoding to AVI may not work as expected.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -pass 1 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -passlog error.log 2>&1 -pass 2 -c:v libx264 -fixed_ips 1 -pix_fmt yuv420p output avi1 avi2.part1 avi2.part2\n```\n(Note: You may split the second pass into parts to handle the long encoding time and allow for continuous streaming. However, since AVI supports segmented encoding, you may avoid this to reduce file fragmentation)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the output contains several issues as it does not correctly reflect the user's request to use the `libvp9` codec. The model incorrectly substitutes `libx264` instead of the specified `libvp9`, and it does not provide a valid command for transcoding to AVI because VP9 is not commonly associated with AVI but rather WebM. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the specific example provided; the example mentions a nonexistent preset, while the model's output uses valid commands and parameters (though not correct for the user's request). However, it still fails to generate a correct command based on the user's input.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command contains a fundamental error as it attempts to use `libx264` rather than the requested `libvp9` codec. Moreover, the options listed for two-pass encoding (`-pass` for both passes) are correct but are incorrectly assigned to an incompatible codec and container combination (AVI is not typically compatible with `libvp9`).\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. It fails to generate a correct `ffmpeg` command to meet the user's requirements and thus should be marked as a failure."
