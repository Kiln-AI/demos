  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To extract the **second video stream** and **fourth audio stream** from `complex.avi`, the command maps these streams using `-map` (FFmpeg indexes streams starting at 0) and copies them directly to the output without re-encoding. This assumes the original codecs of these streams are compatible with the output container format (e.g., MP4). If not, re-encoding would be necessary, but your request implies direct mapping.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `-map 0:v:1`: Selects the **second video stream** (index `1`) from the **first input** (index `0`).\n- `-map 0:a:3`: Selects the **fourth audio stream** (index `3`) from the same input.\n- `-c copy`: Copies the streams **without re-encoding** (faster and preserves quality).\n- **Output container**: `mp4` is assumed, but you can change it to `mkv`, `mov`, etc., if needed.\n- **Assumptions**: The input file contains at least 2 video streams and 4 audio streams. Codecs of these streams must be supported by the output container (e.g., H.264/MP3 for MP4). If not, add re-encoding (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The ffmpeg command it generated correctly maps the second video stream and the fourth audio stream according to the user's request, using the proper syntax for the `-map` option. It also includes the `-c copy` parameter, which reflects the intent to copy the streams without re-encoding, thereby ensuring that the output quality is preserved.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is correctly formatted and does not include any nonexistent parameters or options. It adheres to the expected use of the `ffmpeg` command-line tool.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax for mapping input streams, ensuring the order of options and inputs is maintained. There are no conflicts with the options as described in the man page.\n\nOverall, the model's output is accurate, meets user requirements, and adheres to `ffmpeg` syntax and rules, meaning that it would pass this evaluation."
