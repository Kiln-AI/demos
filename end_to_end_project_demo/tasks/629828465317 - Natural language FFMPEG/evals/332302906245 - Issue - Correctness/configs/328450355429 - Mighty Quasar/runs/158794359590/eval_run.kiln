  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply a brightness and contrast filter followed by a scale filter for 1080p resolution, the `vf` (video filter) option in FFmpeg can be used. \n\n- The brightness and contrast filters use the `eq` video filter:\n  - `eq=brightness=0.2` increases brightness by 20%.\n  - `eq=contrast=1.2` increases contrast by 20%.\n- To chain multiple filters, separate them with a comma.\n- `scale=-2:1080` maintains the aspect ratio and sets the height to 1080p, ensuring it's divisible by 2.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.2,eq=contrast=1.2,scale=-2:1080\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Input format is MP4.\n- Output format is the same as the input.\n- You want to maintain the original aspect ratio for the 1080p resize.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated correctly applies brightness and contrast filters, followed by a scale filter to resize the video to 1080p. The requirements from the user are thoroughly addressed.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the <failure_example>. The command generated is valid and adheres to typical FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All specified options and syntax are appropriate and conform to the guidelines laid out in the man page.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, I conclude that the model's output does not contain any issues. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
