  "input": "Convert input.mov to MP4 with H.265 encoding using the super_slow preset for best compression",
  "output": "To convert a MOV file to MP4 using H.265 (HEVC) encoding with the super_slow preset for optimal compression efficiency, you'll specify the libx265 encoder, set the preset to super_slow, and ensure proper compatibility with MP4.\n\n- `-c:v libx265` selects H.265/HEVC encoding.\n- `-preset super_slow` maximizes compression efficiency at the expense of encoding speed.\n- `-crf 28` is a typical quality setting for H.265; lower values improve quality but increase file size.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream directly without re-encoding for speed and quality preservation, unless you want to re-encode audio.\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows the file to start playing before it's fully downloaded, which is good for streaming.\n\nAssuming you want to preserve audio without re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -preset super_slow -crf 28 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:** If the original audio format is incompatible, you might need to re-encode audio as AAC (`-c:a aac`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command provided correctly specifies the H.265 encoder, the appropriate preset for compression, and it includes options that align with the user's request. It employs `-c:a copy`, which is a valid option for audio handling, assuming the user wants to preserve the audio without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model correctly utilizes valid options and settings, whereas the failure example includes a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the syntax correctly: it includes input specification (`-i input.mov`), output codec specification (`-c:v libx265`), and uses valid options for encoding and compatibility.\n\n4) Given all the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain an issue and should **pass** evaluation as it adheres to the user's requirements and follows the guidelines established in the FFmpeg documentation."
