    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Evaluation of the model's output regarding the specified issue:**\n   - The model's output does not contain any mistakes regarding the command it generates. The command correctly uses the `-map` option to select specific video and audio streams from the input file and specifies `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which matches the user requirement accurately. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation step.\n\n2) **Comparison to the example of a failing output:**\n   - The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The failing output contained an erroneous preset (`extra_fast`), which does not exist. In contrast, the model produced a valid command that follows the proper syntax and logic of FFmpeg. Thus, it should pass this evaluation step.\n\n3) **Checking against the FFmpeg man page requirements:**\n   - The command provided by the model conforms to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, maps the appropriate streams, and uses `-c copy`, which is valid. The command adheres to the expected input-output structure without breaking any grammar or operational rules specified in the documentation. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation step.\n\n4) **Overall conclusion:**\n   - The model's output is correct and meets the user's request without any issues. It should pass as it generates a valid, functioning FFmpeg command."
