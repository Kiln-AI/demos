  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove the audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-encoding the video stream, use stream copy mode (`-c copy`) for the video and drop the audio stream via `-an`. This makes the operation fast and lossless, since the video codec does not change.\n\n- `-c copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-an` disables audio output, effectively removing all audio.\n- No audio decoding is performed, so no re-encoding happens on the video side, keeping the quality intact.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c copy -an output_no_audio.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input video only contains video data (no embedded subtitle or caption streams). If there are any subtitle streams, they will be dropped automatically since no audio is requested to output.\n- codecs and formats are compatible with stream copy for the video stream (commonly, MP4 supports this when all streams are in compatible formats like H.264 video with AAC audio or other codecs compatible with stream copy).\n\nIf stream copy is not compatible, you might need to remux the file as is with `-c copy` and `-vn` or explicitly select compatible codecs to force stream copy.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description> tag. The command generated correctly removes the audio stream from the video file without re-compressing the video stream, thus meeting the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example> because the command it generated does not contain any invalid options or parameters. The command provided by the model is valid and correctly formatted according to ffmpeg's syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options used in the command - `-c copy` and `-an` - are valid and properly applied in the right order. The use of `-c copy` indicates to reuse the existing video stream without re-encoding, while `-an` disables audio recording, effectively removing the audio stream.\n\nBased on the above evaluations, the model's output is correct and comprehensive, and it successfully meets the requirements of the task. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
