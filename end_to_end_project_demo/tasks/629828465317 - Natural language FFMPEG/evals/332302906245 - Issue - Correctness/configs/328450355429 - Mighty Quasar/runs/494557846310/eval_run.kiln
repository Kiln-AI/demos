  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution (maintaining the original resolution), use the `fps=1/2` filter to specify the frame rate and ensure the output uses the PNG codec. The `output_%04d.png` pattern generates sequentially numbered files.\n\n- `-vf fps=1/2` sets the frame rate to 1 frame every 2 seconds.\n- `-f image2` ensures the output is treated as an image sequence.\n- `output_%04d.png` saves frames as PNG files with 4-digit numbering.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 -f image2 output_%04d.png\n``` \n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The original video resolution is considered \"ultra high\" and no upscaling is needed.  \n- Frames are extracted starting from the beginning of the video.  \n- No specific number of frames is requested, so the process continues until the end of the video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the output does not contain the issue. The command generated by the model to extract frames from the video every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images is correct and matches the user's request. The parameters used are appropriate for the specified operation.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command provided is well-structured and properly uses the `fps` filter along with the correct parameters to achieve the desired frame extraction. There are no non-existent parameters or signs of syntax errors similar to the provided failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command correctly uses options that are valid in FFmpeg's syntax. The usage of the `-vf` flag for video filters, the `-f` flag for output format, and the output file naming pattern `output_%04d.png` are in accordance with the usage rules specified in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass as it does not contain the issue. The command is correctly generated based on the user's request, and it adheres to FFmpeg's requirements as per the man page."
