  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from a video and save them as high-resolution PNG images, you can use the `-vf fps` filter combined with specifying the output filename pattern. Ultra-high resolution will be preserved if the original video is high resolution; the command extracts frames without resizing.\n\n- `-vf fps=1/2` selects one frame every 2 seconds.\n- Output filename pattern like `frame_%04d.png` saves sequential images with zero-padded numbering.\n- No resizing is applied, so the original resolution is maintained.\n\nAssuming the original video is high-resolution, this approach extracts high-res frames directly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command it generated is valid and correctly matches the user's requirement to extract frames from a video every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images. The command is logically sound and does not have any mistakes that would prevent it from functioning as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated, `ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame_%04d.png`, uses valid options that are properly structured according to the FFmpeg syntax. There are no invalid presets or commands that do not exist, unlike the example of `-preset extra_fast`, which doesn't exist.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It adheres to the structure and options provided by FFmpeg. It correctly specifies the input file, applies a filter to select frames at the required interval (1 frame every 2 seconds), and provides a valid output filename pattern for the extracted frames. Each part of the command aligns with the expected syntax and function as outlined in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does *not* contain the issue described. It is a valid command that fulfills the user's request effectively. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
