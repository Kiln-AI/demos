  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec, while also applying noise reduction, you can use the following technique:\n\n* `-c:a flac` specifies the FLAC audio codec, but since you asked for the experimental codec, I'll use `-c:a flac -strict experimental`, which enables the experimental FLAC encoder.\n* For noise reduction, I'll apply a simple filter using `afftdn` (affine filter for denoising), a multi-band compression filter, which can help reduce background hiss and noise.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a flac -strict experimental -af \"afftdn=nr=20:ss=5.5\" output.flac\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file video.mp4 is in the working directory.\n- You have sufficient disk space to store the output file.\n- The experimental FLAC encoder might not be compatible with all players, ensure your target player supports it.\n\nPlease note: afftdn is a basic noise reduction filter. Depending on the specific characteristics of your audio, additional or alternative methods may achieve better results.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command presented is correctly structured and valid according to the requirements of the user's request. It specifies the input file, the audio codec, and applies the necessary audio filter for noise reduction. Therefore, it does not violate the expectation of generating a correct command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated does not reference any invalid or non-existent parameters. The use of `-strict experimental` is in line with the handling of experimental codecs in ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are valid:\n   - `-c:a flac` correctly specifies using the FLAC codec.\n   - `-strict experimental` allows the use of experimental features, which is appropriate since the user requested the experimental codec.\n   - `-af \"afftdn=nr=20:ss=5.5\"` applies a valid audio filter to reduce noise.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issues described in any of the evaluation steps; it generates a valid and appropriate ffmpeg command that matches the user's request without errors."
