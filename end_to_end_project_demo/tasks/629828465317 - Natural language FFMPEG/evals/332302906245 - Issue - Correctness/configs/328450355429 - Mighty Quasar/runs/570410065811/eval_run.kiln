  "output": "To add new subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you need to exclude all existing subtitle streams from the output and then add your new subtitle file as a burn-in (hardcoded) or as an external subtitle track.\n\nHowever, if you want to completely remove existing subtitle streams and add new soft subtitle streams, you'll need to explicitly map input streams excluding subtitles and add the new subtitle(s).\n\nAssumptions:\n- You have a subtitle file (e.g., subtitles.srt) you want to add.\n- You want to embed the subtitles as a soft subtitle track (not burned into video).\n- Your input video is input.mkv (replace as needed).\n- The output file is output.mkv.\n\nExample command to exclude existing subtitles by mapping only video and audio streams, and then add new subtitles from a file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s srt output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v` and `-map 0:a` include all video and audio streams from input.mkv, excluding subtitles.\n- `-map 1` adds the subtitles from subtitles.srt.\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies video and audio without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s srt` encodes the subtitle stream in SRT format.\n\nIf your input format or subtitles differ, adjust accordingly. If you want hardcoded subtitles, let me know!",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output seems to accurately generate an `ffmpeg` command that fulfills the user's requirement of adding new subtitles while removing existing subtitle tracks. The command provided correctly maps only the video and audio streams while incorporating the new subtitle stream as specified. There are no apparent mistakes in the command itself, and it matches the user's request, suggesting that it does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model does not use any nonexistent options or incorrect syntax that would cause it to fail. Instead, it utilizes valid options and parameters according to typical `ffmpeg` usage.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the guidelines for mapping streams correctly, and uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` for audio and video streams, indicating that it intends to copy those streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate for the task. The `-c:s srt` option signals that a subtitle stream is being added. All command components are in line with the structure and guidelines outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\n\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; hence it passes the evaluation."
