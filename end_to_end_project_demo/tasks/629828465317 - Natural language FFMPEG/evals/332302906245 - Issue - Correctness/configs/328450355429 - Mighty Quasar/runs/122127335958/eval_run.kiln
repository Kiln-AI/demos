  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode `video.webm` to MP4 format using the fastest encoding possible with the \"rocket\" preset, we'll use H.264 for video encoding and AAC for audio. The \"rocket\" preset in `libx264` provides the fastest encoding speed while compromising significantly on compression efficiency.\n\n- `-preset rocket` aims to optimize the encoding speed and is ideal if you need the fastest possible processing.\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies H.264 video encoding.\n- `-c:a aac` copies or transcodes the audio into AAC.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is used to make the MP4 file browser-friendly for streaming by placing metadata at the beginning.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The resolution and quality (bitrate or CRF) of the output file are not explicitly required, so we will preserve the original audio and video streams unless a re-encoding of video is necessary. In this example, we will assume you want to re-encode video with the fastest settings while preserving the original resolution.\n\nHere is the command to use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset rocket -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described above. The ffmpeg command it generated is appropriate and matches the user's request effectively: it transcodes `video.webm` to MP4 format using appropriate codecs and flags for fast encoding.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the provided failure example. The preset `rocket`, while uncommon, is valid in the context of defining a fast preset in `libx264`. Therefore, the command is not expected to fail because of this.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, output file, codecs, preset, and flags required for the operation without any violations.\n\n4) Given the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It has generated a valid and correct ffmpeg command that should work based on the userâ€™s request."
