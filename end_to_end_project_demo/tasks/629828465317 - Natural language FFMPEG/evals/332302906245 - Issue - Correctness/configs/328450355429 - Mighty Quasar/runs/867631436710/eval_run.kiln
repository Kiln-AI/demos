  "output": "To extract the third video stream and the second audio stream from `multi.avi` and place them into a single output file `final.mp4`, we map the desired streams in ffmpeg.\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (since indexing starts from 0) from the source `multi.avi`.\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream from the source.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the video and audio streams without re-encoding (faster, if formats are compatible). If re-encoding is required, specify the appropriate codec.\n- We assume the streams you want are available and that you want to preserve their original encoding unless otherwise specified.\n\nHere is the ffmpeg command to achieve this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```\n\nIf the original codec is incompatible, you may need to transcode the streams (e.g., using `libx264` for H.264 video). Let me know if you need to re-encode the streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, as the generated command appears to accurately meet the requirements from the user. It correctly maps the third video stream and the second audio stream from the input file and uses appropriate stream copying commands.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is well-formed and relevant to the userâ€™s request, and it does not use any invalid options or parameters that would lead to a failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It properly uses the `-map` options to select specific streams from the input, and utilizes `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` correctly to copy the streams without re-encoding them unless necessary. The use of stream mapping and copying is consistent with the requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the output does not contain any issues and accurately fulfills the user's request, indicating that it should pass the evaluation."
