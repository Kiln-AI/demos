  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress the `video.mov` file using the `hyper` preset for extremely fast processing, you can use the H.264 video codec with the `hyper` preset. This preset prioritizes speed over compression efficiency, making it ideal for rapid encoding. The command also sets a reasonable default quality level (CRF 23) and uses AAC audio encoding for compatibility and quality.\n\nAssumption: You are using H.264 as the video codec unless specified otherwise. You may want to adjust the CRF value if you prioritize quality over file size.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command generated is correctly formatted and appears to satisfy the user's request to compress the video using the specified preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command includes a valid preset \"hyper\" which is recognized by FFmpeg, and it follows the correct syntax. There is no indication of a non-existent preset being used.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The parameters specified (input file, codec, preset, CRF, audio codec, bitrate) are in accordance with the expected usage of the tool as detailed in the documentation.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain any errors and matches the requirements set forth by the user. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
