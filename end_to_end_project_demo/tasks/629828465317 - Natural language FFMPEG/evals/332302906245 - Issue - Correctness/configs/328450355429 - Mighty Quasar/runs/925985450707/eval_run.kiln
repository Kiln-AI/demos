  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "FFmpeg does not support multiple codecs of the same type (video or audio) in a single output file. You cannot have both an H.264 (AVC) and an H.265 (HEVC) video stream in the same MP4 or MKV file. Each video or audio track within a container must be of a single codec.\n\nHowever, you can generate two separate files—one with H.264 and one with H.265—using a single ffmpeg command with output \"mapping,\" or by chaining multiple commands. Here’s how to do it using a single command with mapping:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v:0 libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a:0 copy output_h264.mp4 -c:v:1 libx265 -crf 28 -preset fast -c:a:0 copy output_h265.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v:0 libx264 encodes the first video stream (output_h264.mp4).\n- -c:v:1 libx265 encodes a second video stream (output_h265.mp4).\n- -c:a:0 copy copies the original audio to both files.\n- -crf 23 is a good default for H.264; -crf 28 is a reasonable default for H.265.\n- -preset fast balances speed and compression; adjust as needed.\n\nIf your intent is to have a single output with selectable codecs (e.g., an MKV file), ffmpeg doesn’t support that for video/audio codecs—each stream in a container must use a single codec type.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The output command attempts to create two separate output files simultaneously (`output_h264.mp4` and `output_h265.mp4`) in a single ffmpeg command with one `-i input.mp4` input file. However, ffmpeg does not allow multiple output files to be specified with separate streams like that. Each output file is treated as a separate entity, and the way the command is structured implies a misunderstanding of how output mapping works in ffmpeg. The user requested both codecs in a single output file, and while the model correctly pointed out that this isn't possible per se, the suggested output command is still incorrect and misleading.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The failure example had an incorrect preset (`extra_fast`), although the model's output may not function as intended, it is structured correctly in terms of syntax. \n\n3) No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page concerning syntax structure. However, it misrepresents the capabilities of ffmpeg regarding handling multiple codecs for a single output file stream. The command correctly applies the syntax for encoding but fails based on the incorrect assumption that two different outputs can be specified with the provided flags in a simultaneous command.\n\n4) Based on the above analysis, the model's output does contain the issue identified in step 1. Therefore, it fails to perform the task correctly as requested by the user."
