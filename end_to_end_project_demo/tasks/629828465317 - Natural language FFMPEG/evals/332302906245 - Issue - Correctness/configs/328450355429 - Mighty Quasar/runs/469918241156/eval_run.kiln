  "input": "Convert my 4K video to 1080p and compress it significantly to reduce file size, but keep the best possible quality.",
  "output": "To convert a 4K video to 1080p and compress it significantly while retaining the best possible quality, use the H.264 codec (libx264), scale down the resolution, and apply a constant rate factor (CRF) value that balances quality and file size.\n\n- -vf scale=-2:1080 resizes the video to 1080 pixels height while maintaining the original aspect ratio. The width is auto-calculated and rounded down to the nearest even number, per libx264 requirements.\n- -c:v libx264 sets the video codec to H.264.\n- -preset slow increases compression efficiency at the expense of encoding speed (for best quality at target bitrate).\n- -crf 28 achieves good file size reduction at the cost of some quality loss, but is still reasonable for most content. Adjust lower (e.g., 25) for better quality, or higher (e.g., 32) for smaller file size.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio in AAC at a standard bitrate.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes MP4 for web playback.\n\nAssuming your input is input_4k.mp4 and you want the output as output_1080p.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_4k.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\nThis command efficiently downscales and compresses your 4K video, preserving visually good quality and reducing file size. Adjust the -crf value for your preferred tradeoff between quality and file size.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command seems correct and should work as intended for converting a 4K video to 1080p, while applying compression to reduce the file size without excessively sacrificing quality.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model correctly uses valid parameters and options that are available in ffmpeg, unlike the example which contained an invalid preset.\n\n3) Reviewing the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements dictated therein. The options used in the command are valid and well-documented, and there are no apparent conflicts with the specifications outlined in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does **not** contain any issues based on the evaluation criteria provided above and can be considered correct."
