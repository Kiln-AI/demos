  "input": "I need to convert my video to MP4 with a bitrate of 50000k for high quality output.",
  "output": "To convert your video to MP4 with a specified video bitrate of 50,000 kbps (50 Mbps) for high quality, use H.264 video encoding (standard for MP4) and AAC audio encoding (common for high-quality audio). The audio bitrate is set to 128 kbps as a default balanced choice. No scaling or resolution changes are applied unless specified, so the original dimensions are preserved. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file is named `input.mp4` (replace with your actual filename).  \n- You want to maintain the original resolution and aspect ratio.  \n- Audio is re-encoded to AAC at 128 kbps for compatibility and quality.  \n- The video codec is set to `libx264` for MP4 compatibility.  \n- No additional optimizations (e.g., CRF, presets) are specified, so defaults are used.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly reflects the userâ€™s request to convert a video to MP4 format with a specified video bitrate of 50000k. All parameters appear to be appropriate for the task defined by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and does not contain any invalid parameters or options (like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast` in the failure example).\n\n3) The command generated adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax and parameters used in the command are all valid according to the man page. The use of `-b:v` to set the video bitrate is correct, and the parameters for audio encoding are appropriate.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations, the model's output does not contain any issues and thus passes the evaluation criteria."
