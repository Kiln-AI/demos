  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract specific streams and combine them, use the `-map` parameter to select stream 10 for video and stream 18 for audio, then combine them into a single output file.\n\n- `-map 0:10` selects stream 10 from the first input file (0) as the video source\n- `-map 0:18` selects stream 18 from the first input file (0) as the audio source\n- `-c copy` uses stream copying (no re-encoding) for both video and audio, which is faster and maintains original quality\n- The streams will be combined into a single container format\n\nI'm assuming you want to maintain the original codecs and quality. If you need a specific output format, you can change the extension (e.g., .mp4, .mkv) or specify different codecs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.ts\n```\n\nIf you need the output in a different container format like MP4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly adheres to the requirements of extracting specific video and audio streams from the input file and combining them into a single output file. It correctly applies the `-map` parameters to specify the desired streams, and it uses the `-c copy` option to ensure that the streams are copied without re-encoding, which aligns with the task requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model does not contain any invalid parameters, nor does it use options that are known to fail, such as a non-existent preset. The options used in the command are valid and suitable for the intended operation.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options used (`-i`, `-map`, `-c copy`) are valid and conform to the documented behavior of FFmpeg. The model also included an extension indicating the output format, which is acceptable practice according to the usage of the command.\n\n4) The model's output correctly fulfills the user requisites without any errors. Hence, it should pass the evaluation."
