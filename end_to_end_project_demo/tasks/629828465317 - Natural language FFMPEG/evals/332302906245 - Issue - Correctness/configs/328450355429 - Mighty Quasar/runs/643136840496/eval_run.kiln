  "input": "I need to set a very high bitrate of 100000k for the video and 512k for audio in my conversion.",
  "output": "To set specific high bitrates for video and audio, you'll use the `-b:v` parameter for video bitrate and `-b:a` for audio bitrate. This overrides quality-based encoding (like CRF) and uses constant bitrate encoding instead.\n\n- `-b:v 100000k` sets video bitrate to 100 Mbps (very high quality, suitable for archival or high-end production)\n- `-b:a 512k` sets audio bitrate to 512 kbps (high quality audio)\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio encoding\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\nSince you didn't specify input/output files or resolution, I'm assuming you want to maintain the original resolution and using generic filenames:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 100000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: 100 Mbps video bitrate will result in very large file sizes. For streaming, you might also want to add `-movflags +faststart` for better web compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated correctly sets the high bitrates for video and audio using the correct parameters (`-b:v` for video bitrate and `-b:a` for audio bitrate). The command appears to match the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not have any incorrect options like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`. Instead, all the options and parameters used seem valid and correctly applied.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the specifications and requirements laid out in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses the correct options for setting video and audio bitrates, and there are no violations of the command structure or option application rules. \n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, I conclude that the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, and therefore passes the evaluation."
