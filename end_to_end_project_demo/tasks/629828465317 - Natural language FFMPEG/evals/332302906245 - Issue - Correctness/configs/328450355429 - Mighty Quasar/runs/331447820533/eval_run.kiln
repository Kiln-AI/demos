  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue as described in the issue description. The provided command correctly utilizes the `-f concat` option to combine multiple video files without re-encoding, which meets the user's requirement for \"no re-encoding artifacts.\" The command also correctly formats the input using the process substitution syntax, which is valid in shell environments that support it.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The failing example specifies an invalid preset option (`extra_fast`), while the model's command does not have any invalid or unsupported options. Instead, it uses valid parameters that are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements from the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-f concat` option, specifies input files, and uses the `-c copy` option to copy streams without re-encoding. The use of process substitution (`<(...)`) is valid as long as the command is executed in a shell that supports it. There are no conflicts or misuse of options in the command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output should pass as it explicitly fulfills the user's request: it combines video files without re-encoding, uses valid ffmpeg syntax, and adheres to the requirements laid out in the man page."
