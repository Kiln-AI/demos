  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a media file with multiple tracks, use the -map option in ffmpeg. This allows precise control over which streams (video, audio, subtitles, etc.) you want to include in the output. Stream indices are zero-based and count within their respective types (e.g., video:0, video:1, audio:0, etc.), but if you mean the absolute stream numbers as reported by ffprobe (like in \"Stream #0:15\" for the 16th stream overall), you can specify them as 0:15 for the 16th stream of the first input.\n\nAssuming \"stream 15 for video\" and \"stream 22 for audio\" refer to the absolute stream numbers in the file (as seen in ffprobe output, e.g., Stream #0:15 and Stream #0:22), you can use:\n\n- -map 0:15 selects the 16th stream (stream index 15) from the first input (likely a video stream).\n- -map 0:22 selects the 23rd stream (stream index 22) from the first input (likely an audio stream).\n\nHere's how you would extract those streams and copy them without re-encoding for best quality and speed:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command:\n- -c copy copies the selected streams directly (no re-encoding).\n- Only streams #0:15 (video) and #0:22 (audio) are included in the output.\n\nIf youâ€™re unsure whether these streams are indeed video and audio, or want to confirm, run ffprobe first:\n\n```bash\nffprobe source.mkv\n```\n\nLook for \"Stream #0:15\" and \"Stream #0:22\" to verify their types.\n\nIf you want to re-encode or further process them, you can replace -c copy with codec options like -c:v libx264 and -c:a aac as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be correct and matches the requirements specified by the user. It uses the -map option to select the appropriate video and audio streams and uses -c copy to ensure that the streams are copied without re-encoding, which is a valid approach for preserving quality and speed.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it generated does not contain any non-existent preset or irrelevant options that would cause it to fail.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The -map option is used appropriately to select the specified streams, and the use of -c copy is in line with the general practice of not re-encoding streams when unnecessary. All components of the command comply with the expected syntax and options as outlined in the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided description. Therefore, it should pass."
