  "input": "I want to convert video.webm to MP4 using the h264 codec with the lightning preset",
  "output": "To convert video.webm to MP4 using the H.264 codec with the ultrafast preset (commonly referred to as \"lightning\" speed), you should use libx264 with -preset ultrafast. This preset prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, producing larger files but completing much faster.\n\n- -c:v libx264 encodes video with H.264.\n- -preset ultrafast uses the fastest x264 encoding preset.\n- -c:a aac encodes the audio to AAC, compatible with MP4 containers.\n- -b:a 128k sets AAC audio bitrate to 128 kbps (a commonly used value).\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes the MP4 for web streaming.\n\nAssuming you want to maintain the original resolution and all streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nThis command will quickly transcode your .webm to .mp4 with H.264 video and AAC audio, making the resulting file compatible for most uses and fast to stream.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output meets the issue described. The command it generated is correct, matching the user's requirements. It correctly converts the format from `.webm` to `.mp4`, specifies the H.264 codec, and employs the `ultrafast` preset, which is indeed a valid option for achieving very fast encoding speeds, which aligns with the user's stated \"lightning\" demand.\n\n2) No, the model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not contain any non-existent options or presets. The `ultrafast` preset is valid, unlike the failing example which uses `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are valid and correctly applied, following the structure and guidelines outlined, and addressing user specifications appropriately.\n\n4) The model's output should be marked as **pass** as it does not contain any of the outlined issues. It generated a valid ffmpeg command that accurately translated the user's request into functional output."
