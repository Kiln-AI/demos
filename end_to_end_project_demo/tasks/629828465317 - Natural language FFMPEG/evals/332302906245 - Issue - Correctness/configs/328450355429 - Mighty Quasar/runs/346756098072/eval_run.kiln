  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo apply multiple video filters, you chain them in the -filter_complex option or use -vf for a simple sequence. For overlaying text and applying a blur, you first use the drawtext filter to add text and then the boxblur filter to apply a Gaussian blur. Filters are executed in the order listed in -filter_complex. The syntax is critical: filter parameters are separated by commas; multiple filters are separated by semicolons, or you can string them in one chain as separate inputs/outputs if needed. \n\nAssuming you want to overlay centered text with a blur applied afterward, here's the command. Adjust font, text, and color as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"drawtext=text='Hello World':font='Arial':fontcolor=white@0.7:fontsize=48:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2:box=1:boxcolor=black@0.5, boxblur=10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The drawtext overlay with font, text, and positioning is applied first.\n- boxblur=10 applies a moderate blur (adjust radius as needed).\n- Use -c:a copy to keep the audio stream unmodified.\n\nAdjust the text, font, blur radius, color, or position as needed. For more complex multitext or multiple effects, chaining in -filter_complex becomes more powerful.",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The command provided by the model appears to be correct in syntax and should execute successfully, given that it meets the user's request to overlay text and apply a blur effect. Thus, it does not contain the described issue, and it can be considered to work correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   - The command does not resemble the provided failing example. The output is contextually appropriate for the user's request and does not feature any incorrect or nonexistent options like \"extra_fast\" in the failing example. Therefore, it is not similar to the failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements set forth in the FFmpeg man page:\n     - The input file (`input.mp4`) is specified correctly with valid filters in the `-filter_complex` section.\n     - The use of `drawtext` and `boxblur` is compliant with available filters in FFmpeg.\n     - The audio stream is preserved with `-c:a copy`, which is a proper way to maintain audio quality without re-encoding.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does not contain any issues. It successfully generates a command that aligns with the user request, follows the syntax correctly, and does not use any invalid options. Hence, it passes the evaluation.\n\nOverall, I conclude that the model's output is satisfactory, and it accurately fulfills the userâ€™s request without breaking any FFmpeg rules or syntax conventions."
