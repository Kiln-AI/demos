  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert `multitrack.mov` to WebM with VP9 while preserving the alpha channel (transparency), use the `libvpx-vp9` codec and explicitly enable alpha channel support. WebM supports alpha via VP9, but it requires specific parameters to ensure the transparency is retained. The `-alpha_output 1` flag enables alpha channel encoding, and setting `-pix_fmt yuva420p` ensures the pixel format is compatible with VP9's alpha support. Audio is encoded with `libvorbis`, a standard WebM audio codec. \n\nAssumptions:  \n- The input file has a valid alpha channel (e.g., in `yuva420p` format).  \n- No resizing or cropping is needed.  \n- Audio is included and should be preserved.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -alpha_output 1 -pix_fmt yuva420p -c:a libvorbis multitrack.webm\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The `ffmpeg` command it generated is valid for the requested transformation of preserving the alpha channel when converting `multitrack.mov` to a WebM file using the VP9 codec and should work correctly based on the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated uses valid parameters and does not include any unsupported options, such as the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`. Therefore, it does not exhibit the same type of failure as the example.\n\n3) Referring to the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The parameters used (`-c:v libvpx-vp9`, `-alpha_output 1`, `-pix_fmt yuva420p`, `-c:a libvorbis`) are all valid and logical for the task at hand. Additionally, the order of the options is appropriate relative to the input and output files.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully addresses the user's request. Thus, it passes in terms of generating a correct and appropriate command for the given request."
