  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from `video.avi` every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution, we can use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select='eq(pict_type\\'12\\'):nbPT=1:4:t=2' -vsync 1 -vsync_range 1 -f png -r 60 output_%03d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video.avi` specifies the input file.\n- `-vf select='eq(pict_type\\'12\\'):nbPT=1:4:t=2'` selects every 2nd frame (`t=2`) at the 12th pict_type (`pict_type\\'12\\')` frame type, which typically corresponds to I-frames (keyframes).\n- `-vsync 1` and `-vsync_range 1` are not needed for PNG, but they were added for other container formats like MP4 to ensure correct frame selection.\n- `-f png` specifies the output format as PNG.\n- `-r 60` sets the output frame rate to 60 frames per second, which provides high-resolution frames (3840x2160 is the highest resolution that fits on a standard 16:9 screen).\n- `output_%03d.png` specifies the naming pattern for the output files. The `%03d` means that the output file will be named `output_000.png` for the first frame, `output_001.png` for the second frame, and so on.\n\nAssumptions: I assumed that the user wants to start the extraction from the beginning of the video. If that's not the case, the user will need to provide the `-ss` option to specify the start time.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The `select` filter syntax provided is incorrect, specifically the use of `eq(pict_type\\'12\\')`, which is not a valid way to compare pict types in ffmpeg. The correct use should reference keyframes with `eq(pict_type\\,I)` (or just `eq(pict_type\\,1)` for I-frames). Additionally, the usage of `nbPT=1:4` is also not properly aligned with the required syntax.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does generate a plausible ffmpeg command, albeit with incorrect filters. However, it does not include features like nonexistent parameters or syntax errors that would immediately cause the command to fail in a straightforward way, like `-preset extra_fast`.\n\n3) Upon checking against the man page for ffmpeg, the command does indeed include some incorrect values:\n   - The `select` filter syntax is invalid as mentioned above.\n   - The `-vsync` options are excessive and not necessary for the PNG format output. Their inclusion does not break the command per se but adds unnecessary complexity and potential confusion.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output fails. While it does contain the right components of an `ffmpeg` command, the specifics in the filtering logic used are incorrect, meaning the command would not work as intended to extract frames. Therefore, the command does not fulfill the user's request accurately as it is currently constructed."
