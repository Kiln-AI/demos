  "input": "Convert my video using a bitrate of 25000k for video and 320k for audio to balance quality and size.",
  "output": "To convert your video with specified bitrates for video and audio, you can use the `-b:v` option to set the video bitrate to 25000k (25 Mbps) and `-b:a` to set the audio bitrate to 320k. This approach gives you control over the target bitrates to balance quality and file size.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original format or convert to a commonly used format (e.g., MP4 with H.264 and AAC), here is a basic example command.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with your actual input and desired output filenames.\n\nIf you want me to assume a specific format or output filename, please let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated appears to correctly follow the syntax for setting video and audio bitrates in ffmpeg, with no apparent syntax errors or incorrect parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command does not contain any nonexistent parameters or incorrect flags as seen in the failure example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid options and adheres to the expected syntactic structure for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) Considering the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and therefore it passes the evaluation."
