  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file using ffmpeg, you can use the `-map` option. Here's the command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from your file recording.mkv.\n\n- `-map 0:v:12` maps the 13th (index 12) video stream from the input file to the output (ffmpeg uses zero-based indexing).\n- `-map 0:a:25` maps the 26th (index 25) audio stream from the input file to the output.\n- `0` in `0:v:12` and `0:a:25` refers to the first input file (in this case, recording.mkv), assuming there's only one input file.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- ffmpeg will automatically select the necessary codecs based on the selected streams.\n- The file is correctly formatted as Matroska (mkv) and does not contain any errors that would prevent ffmpeg from processing it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 output.mkv\n```\n\nPlease note that ffmpeg automatically selects codecs to encode the selected streams into the output format (mkv in this case). You may need to explicitly set the codecs using the `-c:v` and `-c:a` options if you want a different codec than the default one chosen by ffmpeg.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issues described in the problem statement. The generated `ffmpeg` command is appropriate for selecting the specified video and audio streams from the given multi-stream input file. It correctly utilizes the `-map` option and adheres to the indexing used by `ffmpeg`. Therefore, it passes this first evaluation step.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly specifies the streams to map and does not use any incorrect or non-existent options. Therefore, it passes this second evaluation step.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated by the `ffmpeg` man page. The use of `-map` options follows the expected syntax and the indexing aligns with zero-based indexing described in the man page. The command is correctly formatted and fulfills the task requirements. Therefore, it passes this third evaluation step.\n\n4) Considering the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the specified issue. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
