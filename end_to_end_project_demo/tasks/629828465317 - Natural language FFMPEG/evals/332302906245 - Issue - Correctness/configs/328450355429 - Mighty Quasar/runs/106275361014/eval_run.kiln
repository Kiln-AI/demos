  "output": "To map the third video stream and the second audio stream from the source file `multi.avi` into a single output file `final.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. This allows you to select specific streams (by index) from the input file and assign them to the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (index starts at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes the video using H.264, which is widely supported.\n- `-c:a aac` encodes the audio using AAC, which is also widely supported.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional but helps with web streaming by placing metadata at the beginning of the file.\n\nAssumption: You want to keep the default settings for video and audio encoding unless specified otherwise. If you need specific resolution, bitrate, or other parameters, they should be added explicitly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly maps the specific video and audio streams from the input file and composes a valid `ffmpeg` command according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. In the failure example, the command uses a non-existent preset option `extra_fast`, which is incorrect. The model's output generates a valid command utilizing known `ffmpeg` options such as `-map`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, and `-movflags`, all of which are correct and appropriate for the specified task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It adheres to the expected syntax, uses valid options in the correct manner, and respects the stream mapping conventions outlined. The model utilizes the correct stream selection syntax and encoder specifications.\n\n4) Given the assessments across the points above, the model's output does not contain the described issue, indicating it passes this evaluation."
