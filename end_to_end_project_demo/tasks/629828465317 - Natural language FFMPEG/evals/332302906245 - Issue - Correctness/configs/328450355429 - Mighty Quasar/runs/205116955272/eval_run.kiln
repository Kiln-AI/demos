  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert an MKV file to MP4 using VP9 (libvpx-vp9) for web streaming, we'll use the VP9 video codec with Opus audio, optimize for streaming with fragmented MP4, and use recommended settings for web delivery.\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` uses the VP9 codec for efficient compression and good web compatibility\n- `-crf 30` sets constant rate factor for VP9 (recommended range 15-35, 30 is good balance)\n- `-b:v 0` enables constant quality mode (required with CRF for VP9)\n- `-c:a libopus` uses Opus audio codec (pairs well with VP9 and has excellent compression)\n- `-b:a 128k` sets audio bitrate to 128 kbps\n- `-f mp4` forces MP4 container format\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes for streaming by moving metadata to the beginning\n\nNote: I'm assuming the input file is named \"input.mkv\" since no filename was specified. VP9 encoding is slower than H.264 but provides better compression for web streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -crf 30 -b:v 0 -c:a libopus -b:a 128k -f mp4 -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Presence**: The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is valid, and it matches the requirements provided by the user to convert the MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming.\n\n2) **Similarity to Failing Output**: The model's output is not similar to the given failing output example. The command produced correctly specifies valid options and codecs compatible with FFmpeg. Hence, it does not contain an invalid option like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All specified options are valid, and the order of options is correct. The command properly uses the libvpx codec and includes appropriate streaming formats and settings such as `-movflags +faststart`.\n\n4) **Conclusion**: Since the output correctly adheres to all the specifications and constraints given in the task prompt and follows the rules outlined in the man page, it passes the evaluation. The command is accurate and appropriate for the user's request."
