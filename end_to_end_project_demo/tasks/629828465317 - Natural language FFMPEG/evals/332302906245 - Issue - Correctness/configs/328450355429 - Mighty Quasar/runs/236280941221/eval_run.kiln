  "input": "I want to encode my video with the flash preset to get the conversion done as quickly as possible.",
  "output": "The “flash” preset isn’t one of FFmpeg’s built-ins; it’s almost certainly someone’s custom alias that simply sets the x264 libx264 encoder to the literal preset called **ultrafast** (the fastest available), plus a low (medium-quality) CRF so the encode finishes as quickly as possible.  \nSince “ultrafast” is deterministic and always shipped with FFmpeg, I’ll give you the closest one-line equivalent.\n\nAssumptions  \n- Input name: `input.mkv` (change to yours)  \n- Output container: H.264 + AAC MP4 (works everywhere)  \n- No scaling or other filters—just “encode fast”.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 30 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you find you need higher quality (at the cost of more CPU) just raise the CRF (-CRF lower) or switch to a slower preset like `veryfast` or `fast`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command produced by the model is correctly formatted and valid according to the FFmpeg documentation. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nNo, the output is not similar to the failing output example. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 30 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) uses valid options and correctly identifies the `ultrafast` preset which is a standard FFmpeg option. Unlike the `extra_fast` preset in the failure example, `ultrafast` is an existing and recognized preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It follows the correct syntax and includes valid parameters. In particular, it specifies the input file, output file, video codec, audio codec, preset, and other relevant options appropriately.\n\n4) **Final Evaluation: Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nOverall, the model’s output is valid, and it does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
