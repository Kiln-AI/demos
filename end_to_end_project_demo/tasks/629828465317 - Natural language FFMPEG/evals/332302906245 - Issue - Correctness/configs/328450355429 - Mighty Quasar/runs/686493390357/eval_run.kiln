  "input": "I need to transcode this video.webm to MP4 format using the rocket preset for the fastest encoding possible.",
  "output": "To transcode video.webm to MP4 with the fastest encoding, you can use the libx264 codec with the \"ultrafast\" preset (there is no \"rocket\" preset, but \"ultrafast\" is the fastest preset available). This will prioritize speed over compression efficiency. The output will be an MP4 file with H.264 video codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is correct, utilizes the \"ultrafast\" preset available in FFmpeg instead of the non-existent \"rocket\" preset, and follows the requirements given in the user input. Therefore, it should pass.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example shows a non-existent preset \"extra_fast,\" whereas the model's output correctly identifies the \"ultrafast\" preset, which is valid. Thus, it does not exhibit the characteristics of a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements in the man page. The syntax and options used in the command are compliant with the established rules for using FFmpeg. It specifies input, output, codecs, and the preset correctly. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is well-structured, adheres to FFmpeg's syntax, and meets the user's request for the transformation without introducing any incorrect or invalid options. Thus, it should pass."
