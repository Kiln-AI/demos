  "input": "Convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound using the cinema_quality preset and save as WAV",
  "output": "To convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound (specifically, 7.1ch with the left, center, right, left rear surround, right rear surround, low-frequency effects, and left side and right side surround channels), use the `af` audio filter `pan` in a custom specified format. The `pan` filter here uses the `stereo|LFE=0.5*FC` format to create an LFE channel, and assigns FL, FR, FC, BL, BR, SL, SR accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"pan=7.1:FL=0.5*FL+0.707*FC+0.5*BL+0.5*SL,FR=0.5*FR+0.707*FC+0.5*BR+0.5*SR,FC=FC,LFE=0.5*FC,BL=0.5*BL,BR=0.5*BR,SL=0.5*SL,SR=0.5*SR\" -c:a pcm_s24le output.wav\n```\nAssumptions: This assumes the input file is Stereo 2ch, and the output is a signed 24-bit little-endian PCM WAV file. Also note that it does not give surround sound but plated stereo as it simply manipulates existing channels, does not actually give 7.1.\n\nHowever FFmpeg does not provide features to turn regular audio to high-quality or realistic 7.1 surround for an advanced approach involving Headquarters ammix file for custom ends \ndesktops and having well equipped studio for an realistic approach",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command generated does not effectively convert stereo audio to a realistic 7.1 surround sound; it merely manipulates the existing stereo channels without creating true 7.1 audio channels. The assumptions stated in the output indicate that the command does not fulfill the user's request to convert stereo audio to 7.1 surround sound properly.\n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example. While it does produce syntactically correct FFmpeg command, it does not meet the userâ€™s requirement meaningfully, similar to how the example with `extra_fast` fails because the preset does not exist. In this case, the manipulation of audio channels does not result in true 7.1 surround sound as stated in the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page; it is well-structured and correctly formatted. However, it fundamentally misunderstands the requirement for converting to 7.1 surround sound. It effectively uses valid options but achieves a different and incorrect outcome than what the user requested.\n\nConsidering the above evaluation points, the model's output fails to fully address the user's request, despite being syntactically correct. It assumes that the adjustment it made to the audio channels constitutes a conversion to 7.1 surround sound, which it does not. Therefore, the overall evaluation is a failure due to inadequacy in fulfilling the user requirement."
