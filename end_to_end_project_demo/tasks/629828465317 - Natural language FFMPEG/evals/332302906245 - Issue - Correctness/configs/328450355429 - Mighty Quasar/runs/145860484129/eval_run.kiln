  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert 5.1 surround sound to stereo while mixing the rear channels at 50% volume, you'll need to use FFmpeg's `pan` audio filter. This filter allows you to specify how different channels are mixed together.\n\n- `-af pan=stereo|FL=<0.707*FC+0.707*FL+0.5*BL>|FR=<0.707*FC+0.707*FR+0.5*BR>`: The `pan` filter is used here with a specific formula to convert 5.1 channels to stereo, where `FC` is the center channel, `FL` is the front left, `FR` is the front right, `BL` is the rear left, and `BR` is the rear right channel. Each channel's contribution is adjusted according to the standard 5.1 to stereo downmix formulas (except for the rear channels, which are mixed in at 50% volume - this is the 0.5 coefficient).\n\n- `-i concert.mp4` specifies the input file.\n\n- `-c:v copy` tells FFmpeg to copy the video stream as is (no re-encoding), which saves time and preserves video quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af pan=stereo|FL=<0.707*FC+0.707*FL+0.5*BL>|FR=<0.707*FC+0.707*FR+0.5*BR> -c:v copy output.mp4\n```\nThis command mixes down the 5.1 channels to stereo audio while preserving the original video and mixing the rear channels at half volume in the downmixed stereo output.\n\nNote: I assumed that maintaining the original video quality is preferred (by avoiding re-encoding). If there's a need to change video encoding for compatibility or size reasons, additional video encoding options could be added, similar to the example provided in your prompt.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output correctly generates an FFmpeg command to convert a 5.1 surround sound audio track to stereo while mixing the rear channels at 50% volume. The command uses the appropriate parameters and filter to achieve the requested transformation. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described in the issue description. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced (`ffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af pan=stereo|FL=<0.707*FC+0.707*FL+0.5*BL>|FR=<0.707*FC+0.707*FR+0.5*BR> -c:v copy output.mp4`) is valid and includes the necessary audio filter and flags. It does not include a preset that does not exist or another known error.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to the guidelines outlined in the man page. It properly specifies the input file, applies the audio filter, and retains the video stream without re-encoding. The use of the `pan` audio filter is correctly implemented. The overall structure and order of options conform to FFmpeg's expected syntax.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nSince the output is well-structured, correctly communicates the task requirements, and does not lead to a failing command, it should pass the evaluation."
