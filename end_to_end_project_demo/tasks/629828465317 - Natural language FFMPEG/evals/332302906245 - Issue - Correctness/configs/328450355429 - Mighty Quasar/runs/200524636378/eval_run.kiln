  "input": "I need to apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening filters in sequence to clean up an old video file.",
  "output": "To apply noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening sequentially to an old video file, use the `nlmeans` filter for noise reduction, `curves` for color correction (adjusting gamma and contrast), and `unsharp` for sharpening. These filters are applied in the order specified. The audio is copied without re-encoding to preserve the original audio stream, though you can replace this with a specific codec if needed.\n\n- `nlmeans`: Reduces noise effectively, with a default strength of 1.5.\n- `curves=type=2:gamma=1.2:contrast=0.8`: Adjusts gamma and contrast for color correction (type=2 is a linear curve).\n- `unsharp`: Sharpens the image with default parameters (luma_a=1.0, luma_b=1.0, luma_threshold=0).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -filter_complex \"[0:v]nlmeans,curves=type=2:gamma=1.2:contrast=0.8,unsharp\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file is named `input.avi` and the output should be `output.mp4`.  \n- Audio is not processed and is copied as-is. If you need audio adjustments, specify a codec (e.g., `-c:a aac`).  \n- Parameters like `gamma`, `contrast`, and `unsharp` may need tuning for optimal results.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated by the model is constructed correctly, using valid filters and parameters that align with the user's request for noise reduction, color correction, and sharpening. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The output does not contain non-existent options or settings; instead, it specifies valid filters and parameters such as `nlmeans`, `curves`, and `unsharp`, which exist in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It appropriately utilizes the `-filter_complex` option with a sequence of valid filters and retains the audio by using `-c:a copy`, which is acceptable and correct practice.\n\n4) Taking all of the above evaluations into account, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, so it should be marked as **pass**. The generated command is appropriate for the user's request, using valid FFmpeg syntax and parameters correctly."
