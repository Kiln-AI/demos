  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multiplexed Matroska (.mkv) file and place them straight into an MP4, you just need a clean re-mux.  \n`ffmpeg` accepts the option `-map 0:n` to pick the nth stream from the *0th* (first) input file.  \nSince you want:\n - video stream #3 (indexing starts at 0 ⇒ `-map 0:v:3`)  \n - audio stream #5 (`-map 0:a:5`)  \n\nWe copy the two chosen streams by value (`-c copy`) and let the container format (MP4) do the rest.  \n(The command below assumes the video stream is already H.264 and the audio is AAC—otherwise transcode as well.)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:5 -c copy edited.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command appropriately maps the specified video and audio streams and uses the correct parameters for copying the streams to the output file. It adheres to the requirements set by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is valid and correctly references the specified streams, while the failure example illustrates a command with a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid options and syntax, correctly mapping the input streams to the output file.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and correctly fulfills the user's request. Therefore, the output should be considered a success."
