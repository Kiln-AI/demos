  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To create a smaller file by re-encoding your video using the blazing preset for speed, replace the input video with your desired output file name, and specify the following options:\n\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset blazing` uses the blazing preset, which is one of the fastest presets in FFmpeg choosing between quality and speed.\n- `-crf 28` adjusts the Constant Rate Factor (lower means better quality, higher means smaller size; 28 is a good balance).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding for speed and quality preservation.\n- `-movflags +faststart` makes the MP4 prepared for seamless streaming.\n\nThis command encodes video only efficiently, copies audio directly, and outputs a fast-ripped MP4 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset blazing -crf 28 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_smaller.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue as it uses the `-preset blazing` option, which is not a recognized preset in FFmpeg. Instead, the available presets are typically `ultrafast`, `superfast`, `veryfast`, `faster`, `fast`, `medium`, `slow`, `slower`, and `veryslow`. Since \"blazing\" is not a valid preset, the command will not work as expected and thus does not match the user's requirements.\n\n2) Yes, the model's output is similar to the failure example provided. The failure example includes an invalid preset, and the current output does the same by using an invalid preset name, which will cause the command to fail.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the man page regarding the order of options and arguments, but it does utilize an invalid preset which leads to a failure of the command as a whole.\n\n4) Since the modelâ€™s output includes an invalid option for the `-preset`, it indeed contains the issue described. Thus, it fails the evaluation due to producing an unusable command."
