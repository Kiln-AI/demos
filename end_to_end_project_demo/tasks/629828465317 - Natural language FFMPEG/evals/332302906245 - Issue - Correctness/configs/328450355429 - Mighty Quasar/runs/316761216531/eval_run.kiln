  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum compression preset, you need to copy the audio stream or decode and re-encode it as FLAC. FLAC allows for different compression levels, ranging from 0 (least compressed, fastest) to 8 (most compressed, slowest). Since you want maximum compression, use -compression_level 8.\n\nKey points:\n- -i specifies the input file.\n- -vn disables video capture.\n- -c:a flac selects the FLAC audio codec.\n- -compression_level 8 sets the maximum compression preset.\n- The output filename uses .flac extension.\n\nAssumption: The video’s audio stream can be extracted or upscaled to FLAC without quality constraints that require re-encoding at lower compression levels.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains no issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command provided correctly extracts the audio from the video file and saves it as a FLAC file with the specified maximum compression preset. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command generated by the model is valid with coherent parameters and does not include any non-existent options or incorrect usage. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options used in the command are all valid and correctly formatted based on the provided functionality of FFmpeg. The option `-compression_level` is indeed a valid parameter for FLAC encoding, and it appropriately uses it to request maximum compression.\n\n4) Since the model's output adheres to all the requirements and provides a valid command for the user’s request, it passes the evaluation. The command is properly constructed and meets the user's requirements accurately."
