  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "You want to select the third audio stream from the input `movie.mkv` and output it to a new file, keeping the original video.  This involves using the `-map` option to specify which streams to include in the output.  We'll select the third audio stream (index 2, since indexing starts at 0) and map it to the output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 output.mkv\n```\n\n*   `-i movie.mkv`: Specifies the input file.\n*   `-map 0:v`:  Selects all video streams from the input file (index 0).\n*   `-map 0:a:2`: Selects the third audio stream (index 2) from the input file (index 0).\n*   `output.mkv`: Specifies the output file name.  The `.mkv` extension is used here, as it is a container format that can hold multiple audio and video streams. If you want to output to a different container format, you can change the extension accordingly. For example, `.mp4`.\n\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The generated command correctly specifies the mapping of the audio and video streams according to the user's requirements of keeping the original video while selecting the third audio stream.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output in the <failure_example>. The command provided does not contain incorrect parameters or syntax, hence it is not indicative of a failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The usage of `-map` is appropriate to select specific streams from the input file, and the indices are correctly utilized. The output file format is also consistent with the selected streams.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described.  \nThus, it should be marked as a **pass**."
