  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge multiple mp4 files seamlessly, the typical method involves creating a text file listing the input files and then using ffmpeg with the concat demuxer. This approach is suitable if all input files have the same codec and format.\n\n- First, create a text file (e.g., `file_list.txt`) with the following content:\n  ```\n  file 'part1.mp4'\n  file 'part2.mp4'\n  file 'part3.mp4'\n  ```\n- Then run ffmpeg with the concat demuxer to merge these files accurately without re-encoding, preserving quality and speed.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:** The input files are encoded with compatible codecs and formats; otherwise, you might need to re-encode.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is correct for merging the three video files and utilizes the concat demuxer properly. The explanation provided gives a clear overview of the steps involved.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy output.mp4`) is valid and does not use any incorrect parameters, unlike the failing output example with an incorrect preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly follows the syntax for using the concat demuxer, and it assumes that the input files share the same codec and format, which is a valid assumption for using `-c copy` (to copy the streams without re-encoding). Thus, it adheres to the stipulated order of file options and keeps the command structure intact.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is valid for the task of merging the specified video files, and the output should be considered successful."
