  "input": "Use my Nvidia GPU to speed up this conversion. Re-encode `gameplay.mkv` to `gameplay.mp4` with the NVENC encoder and a CRF of 20.",
  "output": "To utilize your Nvidia GPU for faster encoding, use the NVENC H.264 encoder (`h264_nvenc`). Unlike libx264, the CRF parameter isn't supported directly; instead, NVENC uses a \"constant quantization parameter\" (`-cq`) in conjunction with rate-control mode (`-rc vbr`/`-rc vbr_hq`). The closest equivalent is using `-cq 20` with `-rc vbr` for quality-based output similar to CRF 20 in libx264. \n\nWe'll also use `-pix_fmt yuv420p` for maximum compatibility and `-movflags +faststart` to enable fast streaming in browsers.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original audio stream unchanged (to save processing), you can copy the audio with `-c:a copy`. If you specifically need re-encoded AAC audio, change `-c:a copy` to `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -hwaccel cuda -i gameplay.mkv -c:v h264_nvenc -rc vbr -cq 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a copy gameplay.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- You're okay with copying the original audio stream.\n- Your GPU and drivers support NVENC and CUDA.\n- Input and output resolutions don't need scaling; only codec change.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model appears to be correct and matches the user's requirements for using NVENC to convert `gameplay.mkv` to `gameplay.mp4` with a CRF of 20 (converted to the appropriate NVENC parameters).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command it generated is valid and makes use of the appropriate encoder and parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used in the command are valid and correctly employed according to the man page specifications. \n\n4) Overall, the model's output is appropriate, and the command it generated effectively meets the userâ€™s request without errors. Thus, the output should pass the evaluation."
