  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams in ffmpeg, use the `-map` option, where `-map 0:15` picks the 15th stream from the first input file for video and `-map 0:22` picks the 22nd stream for audio. By default, ffmpeg copies the streams as-is with `-c copy`, which is faster and avoids re-encoding.\n\nAssuming stream 15 is a video stream and stream 22 is an audio stream in your file `source.mkv`, the following will copy them into a new file called `output.mkv`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-map 0:15` selects the 15th stream (video) from the first (only) input.\n- `-map 0:22` selects the 22nd stream (audio).\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n\nIf you need to encode, replace `-c copy` with your chosen codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as it generates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user requirements. The command effectively selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file without making any incorrect assumptions or generating a command that would fail.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The command provided by the model uses valid ffmpeg syntax and options, which do not reference any nonexistent parameters or incorrectly formatted options, unlike the `extra_fast` preset failure example.\n\n3) The command follows the requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The `-map` options are used correctly to select specific streams, and the `-c copy` option is appropriate for copying the streams without re-encoding. This aligns with the description of how options affect the next specified file, and there are no conflicts or syntax errors in the command.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain any issues, passes the evaluation process, and generates a working command for the user's request."
