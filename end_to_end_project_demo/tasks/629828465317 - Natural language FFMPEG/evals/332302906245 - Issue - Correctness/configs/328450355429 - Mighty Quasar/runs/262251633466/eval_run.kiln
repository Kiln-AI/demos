  "input": "Transcode my 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the turbo preset for fast processing",
  "output": "To efficiently transcode a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using FFmpeg, use the following best practices:\n\n- Use the H.264 codec (libx264) for broad compatibility and browser support.\n- The turbo preset is commonly referred to as superfast or veryfast in FFmpeg. Use veryfast for much faster processing at a modest trade-off in file size and efficiency.\n- The scale filter resizes to 1080p (height=1080, width automatically adjusted to preserve aspect ratio).\n- AAC is used for audio, and yuv420p for maximal compatibility.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_4k.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\n**Parameters explained:**\n- `-vf scale=-2:1080` resizes the video height to 1080, width is auto-calculated to maintain aspect ratio and divisible by 2.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 encoder.\n- `-preset veryfast` provides a good trade-off between speed and quality; \"turbo\" typically maps to veryfast or superfast.\n- `-crf 23` is a balanced quality setting (lower values = higher quality).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio to AAC at 128kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` relocates MP4 metadata for faster streaming.\n\nThis setup assumes your input is mp4; change filenames as needed for other formats.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is consistent in using valid parameters and syntax, ensuring that the command will render correctly, and it addresses the user's request to transcode a 4K video to 1080p MP4 with the turbo preset for fast processing.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced consists of valid options and codec names that are recognized by FFmpeg, and the chosen preset \"veryfast\" correctly correlates with the user's indication of wanting a \"turbo\" mode.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The parameters used are valid and in line with FFmpeg's options and requirements.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Its command is syntactically correct, aligns with FFmpeg documentation, successfully meets the user requirements, and avoids any non-existent parameters or malformed syntax. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
