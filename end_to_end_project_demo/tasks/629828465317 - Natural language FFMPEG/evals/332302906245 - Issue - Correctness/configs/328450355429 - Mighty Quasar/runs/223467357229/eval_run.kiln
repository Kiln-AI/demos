  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-track media file, use the `-map` option. Map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 specifically, ensuring that only those streams are included in the output.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is named `input.mp4`.\n- Streams are zero-indexed, so stream 6 is `0:6` (if the input has only one file).\n- You want to include only those streams in the output.\n\nThis command will include only the specified streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain** the issue described. The ffmpeg command produced correctly uses the `-map` option to select video stream 6 and audio stream 9 from the input file, fulfilling the user’s request for creating `output.mp4`. Additionally, the assumption about the input video file being `input.mp4` is a reasonable default given that the user did not specify a filename.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output. The constructed command successfully uses the `-map` command accurately along with the file structure, and does not present a wrong option like an invalid preset name.\n\n3) The command does **not break any requirements** dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map` to specify the video and audio streams is appropriate, and the syntax follows ffmpeg’s command structure correctly.\n\n4) Given all assessments above, the model's output does **not contain** the issue described in the initial task requirement. Therefore, it should be marked as a **pass**."
