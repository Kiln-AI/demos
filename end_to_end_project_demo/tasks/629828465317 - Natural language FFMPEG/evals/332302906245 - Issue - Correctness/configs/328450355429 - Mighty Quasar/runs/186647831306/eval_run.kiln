  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using ffmpeg, the `deshake` filter can be applied. This filter attempts to correct small vertical and horizontal camera motions.\n\n- The command below applies `deshake` with default parameters. For mild to moderate shakiness, the defaults fit many use cases.\n- If the video is extremely shaky or if you need fine-tuning, you can add custom parameters (e.g., `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, etc.).\n- The output is encoded with the same video codec as the input, and audio is copied.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a copy stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is an h264 video.\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 18` is chosen for high-quality output; change `crf` value for different quality.\n- If you want to use a different codec or quality setting, adjust accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be valid and applicable for stabilizing a video file with the `deshake` filter.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated uses valid parameters and options, while the failure example presented an invalid preset that does not exist.\n\n3) Based on the man page for ffmpeg, the command provided by the model does not break any requirements stated there. The command structure follows a valid format for input and output, and the options used are legitimate for video stabilization. The assumptions made are reasonable, such as the assumption about the codec of the input and the chosen quality settings.\n\n4) Overall, the command contains the correct use of `deshake` for video stabilization, follows the expected structure for ffmpeg commands, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page. Therefore, it should be evaluated as a successful response."
