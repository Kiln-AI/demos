  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert 5.1 surround to stereo while reducing the rear channels to 50 % volume, we build a custom-channel-mapping (-ac 2, -af ...).\n\n- ­-ac 2 tells ffmpeg to drop to exactly two output channels.  \n- The pan filter lets us set every output channel’s gain for every input channel.  \n- In the classic L R C LFE Ls Rs 5.1 layout (input channels 0-5), output–left is built from 1.0×L + 1.0×C/SQRT(2) + 0.5×Ls; output–right from 1.0×R + 1.0×C/SQRT(2) + 0.5×Rs. That keeps normal level for front & center while halving the rear.\n\n(All other tracks are copied; if you want to re-encode just the video track, add `-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23` etc.)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 \\\n  -af \"pan=stereo|FL=FC+FL+0.5*SL|FR=FC+FR+0.5*SR\" \\\n  -ac 2 \\\n  -c:v copy \\\n  concert_stereo.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the specific issue described. The ffmpeg command that has been generated is correct and should work as intended to convert a 5.1 surround sound audio track to stereo, while reducing the volume of the rear channels to 50%. The explanation provided also covers the parameters used appropriately. Therefore, this output should pass.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and uses correct ffmpeg syntax, while the example provided in the failure description uses a non-existent preset which would result in an error. The command produced by the model specifies valid options and parameters based on the user's requirements.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options are correctly applied, and the order of the options adheres to the rules stated in the ffmpeg documentation. The command is structured to accomplish the task of converting 5.1 audio to stereo while adjusting the rear channel volumes correctly.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nSince the command is appropriate, without any errors that would violate ffmpeg's syntax or functioning, this output should pass and does not contain the issue described. The command accurately meets the user’s request and adheres to the guidelines established in the ffmpeg documentation."
