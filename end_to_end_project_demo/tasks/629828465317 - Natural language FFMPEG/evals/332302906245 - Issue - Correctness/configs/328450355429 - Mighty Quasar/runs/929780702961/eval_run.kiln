  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert an MKV file to an MP4 container using the WebM (VP9) codec for better streaming efficiency, you should technically use the `libvpx-vp9` encoder inside an MP4 container (which is less common but supported). Alternatively, use the VP9 codec in WebM format (`.webm`). However, if you specifically want MP4 with VP9 (streamable MP4), you might need to encode the audio to Opus or AAC, and for audio compatibility in browsers, AAC is recommended.\n\nA practical approach to make MP4 streamable online is to convert to MP4 using VP9 video and Opus audio, which are browser-compatible. MP4 containers support VP9 video and Opus audio streams well.\n\nKey points:\n- Use `-c:v libvpx-vp9` to encode video as VP9.\n- Use `-b:v` to set the video bitrate (e.g., 2M for good quality).\n- Use `-b:a` to encode audio as Opus (browser-compatible).\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` to optimize MP4 for progressive streaming.\n- Ensure pixel format compatibility with the container (yuv420p).\n\nAssuming your file is named input.mkv and you want output.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -b:a libopus -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you cannot get the above command to work, VP9 in MP4 is less standard, or you need best browser support, consider converting to `.webm` (via `-c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a libopus output.webm`), as a more common workflow for web streaming with VP9.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain an issue because the command it generated uses `libvpx-vp9` codec in an MP4 container, which is less common and might not be supported in all scenarios. While it is possible, the more standard approach would be to use the VP9 codec in a WebM format, as stated by the model itself. Therefore, there is ambiguity about whether the command will work correctly for MP4 with VP9 as not all containers universally support this combination.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given. The original command generated by the model includes valid options and codecs. The parameters used appear correctly formatted and adhere to the expected commands, even though the use of VP9 in an MP4 container is unconventional.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nNo, the command does not break any requirements from the man page for FFmpeg. All options in the command (such as `-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-b:a`, and `-movflags`) are used correctly according to the guidelines provided, assuming the user has the necessary codecs available in their FFmpeg build.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n**Fail.** The model's output indeed encapsulates an ambiguity surrounding the use of `libvpx-vp9` in an MP4 container, which is non-standard. It does not consider that a common practice is to use VP9 in a WebM format for web streaming. Therefore, while technically not incorrect, it leads to a potential issue with compatibility and ease of use, and this could mislead the user into using a command that may not work in all cases."
