  "input": "Convert my video file movie.mkv to MP4 format using the ultrafast2 preset for quick encoding",
  "output": "To convert movie.mkv to MP4 using the ultrafast2 preset (very fast encoding speed, lower quality), you should transcode both video and audio using H.264 (libx264) and AAC codecs (common MP4 support). The preset \"ultrafast2\" is assumed to be a valid libx264 preset (not an official FFmpeg preset); instead, you'll want to use \"ultrafast\" or \"veryfast\". If your ffmpeg build does not support \"ultrafast2\", stick with \"ultrafast\". This approach maintains compatibility and maximizes speed.\n\nKey points:\n- -c:v libx264 to encode video with H.264.\n- -crf 28 to increase speed (lower crf means higher quality, crf 28 is lowest (highest speed, lowest quality)).\n- -preset ultrafast (or veryfast for more speed).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k to use AAC audio at 128kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart to enable progressive streaming in MP4.\n\nAssuming you want to preserve the original bitrate/streaming friendliness:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart movie_ultrafast.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The use of the preset \"ultrafast2\" is questionable because it is not a standard libx264 preset. While the model does mention that \"ultrafast2\" may not be an official preset and suggests using \"ultrafast\" instead, it should have outright recommended not to use an unvalidated preset and instead provide a valid command directly.\n\n2) The output's command does not appear similar to the failure example provided. In the failure example, the preset used does not exist, whereas the model recognizes that \"ultrafast2\" may not be valid and suggests \"ultrafast\" as an alternative.\n\n3) The primary command format does not break any specific requirements from the man page. While the recognition of \"ultrafast2\" as potentially invalid is noted, the parameters used in the command itself adhere to the correct way to structure an ffmpeg command.\n\nOverall, while the model's command format is correct, it fails to provide a command that straightforwardly meets the user's request due to the ambiguity surrounding the preset. Thus, the model's output ultimately leads to confusion and potential issues for the user attempting to execute the command. Therefore, it can be considered a failure in terms of meeting the user's requirements effectively."
