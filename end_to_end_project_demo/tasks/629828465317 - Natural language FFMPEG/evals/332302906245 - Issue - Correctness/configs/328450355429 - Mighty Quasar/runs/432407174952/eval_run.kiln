  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark to the bottom-left of your video:\n\n- The overlay filter places the watermark at position (10, main_h-overlay_h-10): 10 pixels from the left edge, and 10 pixels from the bottom (change values if you want exact corners).\n- To make the watermark semi-transparent, use format=rgba and the colorchannelmixer filter to adjust the alpha channel (opacity). 0.5 means 50% opacity.\n- Assumption: logo.png contains transparency (alpha channel). If not, the entire image will be blended at the set alpha.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.5[wm];[0][wm]overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10\" -c:a copy output_watermarked.mp4\n```\n\nThis command overlays a 50% transparent `logo.png` at the bottom-left of `input.avi`, copying the audio stream directly. Adjust the aa= value for more/less transparency.",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided information and the criteria specified, let's break down the assessment step-by-step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not seem to contain any issues related to the correctness of the generated FFmpeg command. The command is properly structured to meet the user request of adding a semi-transparent watermark to the video. Therefore, it passes this check.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   The output of the model is not similar to the example of a failing output. It correctly contains structured options in accordance with the FFmpeg syntax. There are no missing or incorrect option names, and all filters and parameters used are valid. Therefore, it passes this check as well.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command adheres to the structure outlined in the FFmpeg man page. The use of overlay filter, setting the format to rgba, and applying the color channel mixer filter with an alpha value for transparency are all valid according to the documentation. The command also retains the audio stream (`-c:a copy`), which is appropriate. Therefore, it passes this check.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation criteria. It generated a command that is syntactically correct and matches the requirements provided by the user. Thus, it would be considered successful in this instance.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is accurate, does not contain issues, and adheres to the commands and options specified in the FFmpeg documentation."
