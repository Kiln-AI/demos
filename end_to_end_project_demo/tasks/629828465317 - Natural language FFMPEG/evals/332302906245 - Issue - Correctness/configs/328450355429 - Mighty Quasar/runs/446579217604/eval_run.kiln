  "input": "Extract a specific segment from my long video (from 5:30 to 12:45) and save it as a separate file with lossless compression.",
  "output": "To extract a segment from 5:30 to 12:45 with **lossless compression**, use the `-ss` (start time), `-to` (end time), and specify a lossless codec like `ffv1` for video and `pcm_s16le` for audio. The `.mkv` container is ideal for this format because it supports lossless compression natively.\n\n- **-ss 5:30** starts at the 5-minute-30-second mark.\n- **-to 12:45** ends at the 12-minute-45-second mark.\n- **-c:v ffv1** selects a lossless video codec.\n- **-c:a pcm_s16le** ensures lossless audio encoding (16-bit PCM signed).\n- Assumes input is a common format (.mp4, .avi, etc.) and outputs to `.mkv`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 5:30 -to 12:45 -c:v ffv1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that matches the user requirements: extracting a segment from the video and using lossless compression while specifying appropriate parameters. The command constructed follows the correct logic for the task presented.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 5:30 -to 12:45 -c:v ffv1 -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv` is logically and syntactically correct according to the FFmpeg command line tool's usage.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used (`-ss`, `-to`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, and the input/output file specifications) adhere to the expected format and the options are correctly used. There are no syntax errors or invalid parameters in the command provided.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It successfully generates a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirement to extract a segment from a video with lossless compression. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
