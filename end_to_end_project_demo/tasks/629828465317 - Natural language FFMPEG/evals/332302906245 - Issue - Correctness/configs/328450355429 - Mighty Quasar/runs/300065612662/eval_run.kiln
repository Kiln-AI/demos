  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To reduce the file size of `recording.mp4` while prioritizing encoding speed using the `blazing` preset, we'll use the H.264 video codec with a higher CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value and AAC audio with a lower bitrate. The `blazing` preset is the fastest available in FFmpeg for libx264, which helps in quick encoding.\n\n- `-preset blazing` ensures the fastest encoding speed.\n- `-crf 28` reduces the video quality (from the default 23) to lower file size while maintaining acceptable visual quality.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 64k` reduces the audio bitrate to 64 kbps for smaller file size.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional but helps with quick streaming if needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -preset blazing -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 64k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues with the ffmpeg command it generates. The command produced is syntactically correct and matches the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command uses the correct `-preset blazing`, which exists, unlike the `-preset extra_fast` from the example, which does not exist.\n\n3) Reviewing the command against the ffmpeg man page shows that it adheres to the required options and structure. The parameters used, such as `-preset blazing`, `-crf 28`, and `-c:a aac -b:a 64k`, are valid based on the provided description and do not violate any syntax or rules.\n\n4) Given that the command is valid, matches user requirements, and follows ffmpeg's documentation, it indicates that it passes the evaluation criteria set forth."
