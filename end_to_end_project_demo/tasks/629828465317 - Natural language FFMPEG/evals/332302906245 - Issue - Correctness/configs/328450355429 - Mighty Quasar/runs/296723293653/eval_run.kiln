  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from your `recording.mkv` file, you can use the `-map` option in FFmpeg. This allows you to specify which streams to include in the output. The assumption is that your file contains at least 12 video streams and 25 audio streams, and you want to explicitly choose the 12th video stream and the 25th audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:11 -map 0:a:24 output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-map 0:v:11` selects the 12th video stream (stream index starts at 0, so 11 is the 12th).\n- `-map 0:a:24` selects the 25th audio stream (stream index starts at 0, so 24 is the 25th).\n- The output format is not specified, so it defaults to the container format of the input (MP4 in this case). If you want a specific format, you can add it explicitly (e.g., `-f mp4`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option to select the appropriate video and audio streams from the input file `recording.mkv`. The command matches the user's request to select specific streams without any evident mistakes.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:11 -map 0:a:24 output.mp4`) is correct in syntax and usage, specifically using valid indices for the streams, and it does not contain an invalid option.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax for stream mapping and specifies valid stream indices appropriate for selecting video and audio streams. Since the model correctly acknowledges the 0-based indexing of streams, the command is compliant with the specifications detailed in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the checks above, the model's output is valid and does not contain the issue described, thus it passes the evaluation."
