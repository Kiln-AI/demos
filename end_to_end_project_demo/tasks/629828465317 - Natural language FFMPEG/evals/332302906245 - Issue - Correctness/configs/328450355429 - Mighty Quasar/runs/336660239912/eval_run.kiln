  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple filters in a specific order with `ffmpeg`, you can chain them together using commas. The general syntax is `-vf filter1=parameters,filter2=parameters,...`. \n\nAssuming you want to apply the temporal noise reduction filter (`tblend` or `hqdn3d` could work for this, but let's use `tblend`), spatial denoising (`hqdn3d` again, since it can do both temporal and spatial), and edge enhancement (`unsharp`), the command might look like this:\n\n- `tblend=1:1:3:3` applies a blend of 1 frame before and 3 frames after for temporal noise reduction. You might need to adjust these settings.\n- `hqdn3d=1.5:1.5:6:6` uses spatial denoising with three iterations (`1.5` radius, `1.5` threshold for both `luma` and `chroma`, the `6:6` are mixed and block sizes). Adjust values as necessary.\n- `unsharp=3:3:0.5:3:3:0.5` enhances edges with a 3x3 matrix (first two numbers), adjusting the `amount` and `threshold` for luma and chroma. Again, these are example settings.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf tblend=1:1:3:3,hqdn3d=1.5:1.5:6:6,unsharp=3:3:0.5:3:3:0.5 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made include the use of `tblend` for temporal noise reduction (another common choice is `hqdn3d` with adjusted parameters), assuming the default settings for each filter are close to what you need, and that the input is an MP4 file named `input.mp4`. The output will also be in H.264 due to its broad compatibility. Adjust filter settings and output quality as necessary based on your source material and intended application.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step according to the criteria provided:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The output includes a correct syntax for applying temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in the specified order. The model correctly explains how to chain filters together and provides a suitable ffmpeg command. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output is not similar to the provided failure example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command produced in the model's output is valid and matches the requirements, using the correct filter options and parameters. Hence, it does not indicate a failure.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the ffmpeg man page requirements. It properly specifies the input file, applies the filters in the correct order, and defines the codec and quality settings for the output file. The parameters and options used in the filters are also appropriate to their usage as per the documentation.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble a known failure example, and adheres to all requirements set forth in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, the model's performance is satisfactory for this task."
