  "input": "Can you double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` but keep the original audio pitch?",
  "output": "To double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` while preserving the original audio pitch, we'll use the `atempo` filter to adjust the audio tempo without changing the pitch. We'll also use `setpts` to speed up the video.\n\n- `setpts=0.5` changes the playback time of the video to be twice as fast (1/0.5 = 2).\n- `atempo` adjusts the audio tempo.  A value of 2.0 doubles the speed.\n- We'll use `-c:a aac` to encode the audio to AAC.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5[v];[0:a]atempo=2.0[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output_double_speed.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command it generated is correct and matches the requirements from the user: it doubles the speed of the video while preserving the audio pitch, using the appropriate filters (`setpts` for video speed and `atempo` for audio tempo adjustment).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid and properly constructed, unlike the failure example which contains an invalid preset and does not serve the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It makes correct use of the `-filter_complex` option to apply both audio and video filter changes appropriately, and utilizes the correct mappings for output streams.\n\n4) The model's output passes the evaluation as it successfully fulfills the task without containing any errors or issues based on the command syntax and the requirements specified by the user. The command is efficient and performs the intended transformation accurately."
