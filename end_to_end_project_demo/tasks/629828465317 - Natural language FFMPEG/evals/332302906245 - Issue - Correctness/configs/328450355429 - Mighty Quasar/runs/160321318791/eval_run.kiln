  "output": "To extract the third video stream and the second audio stream from a multi-plaintext file (like mov or mp4 with multiple streams), you need to explicitly select those streams by their stream indexes.\n\n- The index 3 refers to the third video stream, indexed starting at 0.\n- The index 2 refers to the second audio stream, starting from 0.\n\nUse the `-map` option in ffmpeg to explicitly map the desired streams from the input file.\n- The output container (MP4) will automatically handle the streams assigned.\n- No re-encoding is necessary unless streams need conversion (not in this case).\n\nHere is the ffmpeg command that maps the third video stream and second audio stream from input multi.avi to final.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:3 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n- `-map 0:v:3` selects the third video stream from the first input.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the second audio stream from the same input.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for fastest processing and quality preservation.\n\nIf the streams need stream copy operation and compatibility with container constraints, this command is sufficient. Otherwise, re-encoding options can be added as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command to map the third video stream and the second audio stream from the input file `multi.avi` to an output file `final.mp4`. The command follows the standard syntax for specifying streams using the `-map` option and uses `-c copy` for stream copying. Therefore, it does not contain an issue as described in the issue description.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the provided failing output example. The command generated is correctly formatted and utilizes valid `ffmpeg` syntax and options. The command does not include any invalid parameters like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the `ffmpeg` man page requirements. The mapping of input streams using `-map` is correctly done, and the `-c copy` option is valid for copying streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate since there is no indication of needing to convert streams. Thus, it does not break any requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model does not contain any issues, it should pass the evaluation. It generates a correct `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements."
