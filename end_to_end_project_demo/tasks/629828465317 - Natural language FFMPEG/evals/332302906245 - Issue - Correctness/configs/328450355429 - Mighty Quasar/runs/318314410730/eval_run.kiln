  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress a video using the maximum efficiency preset, you should use the libx264 encoder with the `slower` or `veryslow` preset (since `maximum_efficiency` is not a standard preset for libx264). However, if you mean using the latest `libx264` options, the most efficient preset is `veryslow` for compression quality, or `placebo` for maximum compression but very slow. Assuming you mean `veryslow`, you can adjust the CRF for quality and compression.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 encoder.\n- `-preset veryslow` maximizes compression efficiency.\n- `-crf` controls quality; lower CRF means higher quality. You should use a lower CRF for maximum compression efficiency.\n- To save storage space, set CRF to a higher value (e.g., 28-30) depending on your quality needs.\n\nHere's a command assuming you want to maximize compression with reasonable quality:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 30 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nIf audio compression isn't critical or you prefer to omit audio, you could also remove or change the audio options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as it mentions a \"maximum_efficiency\" preset which does not exist in the standard `libx264` presets. Instead, it should use \"veryslow\" or \"slower\" for high compression efficiency.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example since it references a non-standard preset option. However, the command itself contains valid options that could potentially work if corrected.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page since the options utilized in the command (like `-c:v libx264`, `-preset veryslow`, and `-crf`) are recognized and valid. However, the initial explanation and choice of `preset` is faulty, which reflects poor understanding.\n\n4) Given the issues identified — primarily the incorrect mention of a non-existent preset and the reliance on a single preset without exploring valid alternatives — the model's output fails the evaluation."
