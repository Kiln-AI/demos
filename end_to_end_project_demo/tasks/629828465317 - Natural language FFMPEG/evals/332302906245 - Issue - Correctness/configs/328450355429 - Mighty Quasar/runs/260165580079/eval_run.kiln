  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from a complex input file to a standard MP4 container, explicitly specify the streams using `-map` (assuming the input is indexed starting at 0 for both video and audio). Videos are often re-encoded with **libx264** and audio with **AAC** to ensure compatibility with the MP4 container. The `+faststart` flag is added to enable efficient streaming in browsers. If the input streams are already H.264/AAC, use `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to avoid unnecessary re-encoding.\n\n### Key assumptions:\n1. Streams are counted starting from 0 (e.g., 7th video stream is index `6`).\n2. Output to MP4 requires H.264 and AAC codecs (standard for cross-platform compatibility).\n3. You likely need re-encoding unless the input codec is already H.264/AAC.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **`-map 0:v:6`** selects the 7th video stream (index `6`) from the first input (`0`).\n- **`-map 0:a:13`** selects the 14th audio stream (index `13`) from the input.\n- **`-c:v libx264`** ensures video is encoded in H.264 (required for MP4).\n- **`-c:a aac`** ensures audio is encoded in AAC (required for MP4).\n- **`-crf 23`** sets a target quality level for video (lower values are better; default is 23).\n- **`-pix_fmt yuv420p`** ensures compatibility with devices/browsers.\n- **`-movflags +faststart`** makes the MP4 seekable for web use.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is valid and accurately uses the `-map` option to select the appropriate streams from the input file, and it provides reasonable assumptions and explanations. The command successfully matches the user’s requirements of mapping the 7th video and 14th audio streams, while also converting to a compatible MP4 format.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the failing example. The command `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` fails due to an invalid preset; however, the model’s output is correctly structured, valid, and conforms to `ffmpeg` requirements.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command produced by the model adheres to requirements outlined in the `ffmpeg` man page. Each part of the command follows the correct syntax, and the mapping is accurately specified. The options for codecs and pixel formats are consistent with the specifications for output formats, particularly for MP4.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue, so it should be marked as a **pass**. The command generated is correct, functioning, and meets the requirements of the user input."
