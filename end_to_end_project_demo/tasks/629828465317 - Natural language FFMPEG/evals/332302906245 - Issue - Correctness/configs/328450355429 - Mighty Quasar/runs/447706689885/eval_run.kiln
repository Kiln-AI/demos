  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a Gaussian blur to a video using `ffmpeg`, you can chain filters with the **`-vf`** (video filter) option. The filters are applied in sequence, so the blur is applied first, followed by the text overlay. The `drawtext` filter requires a font file, which must be in a valid location on your system.\n\n- **`boxblur=10:10`**: Applies a Gaussian blur with intensity 10 horizontally and vertically.\n- **`drawtext=...`**: Adds text to the video with a default example (font path, text content, position are placeholders).\n- Filters are separated by commas in the correct order.\n- Assumption: The font file path (`/path/to/font.ttf`) must be replaced with a valid system font path (e.g., `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf`).\n\n**Example command:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"boxblur=10:10,drawtext=fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:text='Your Text':x=100:y=50:fontcolor=white:fontsize=36:shadowcolor=black:shadowx=2:shadowy=2\" -c:a copy output_blurred.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **`boxblur=10:10`**: Blurs the entire video (adjust intensity values as needed).\n2. **`drawtext`**:\n   - `fontfile`: Path to a `.ttf` or `.ttc` font file (ensure it exists on your system).\n   - `text='Your Text'`: Replace with your desired overlay text.\n   - `x/y`: Position the text (e.g., `x=0:y=10` for top-left).\n   - `fontcolor/size`: Customize color and size.\n   - `shadowx/y`: Optional softness/shadow for legibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue, as the generated command properly chains multiple video filters using the `-vf` option and follows the correct syntax. The filters `boxblur` and `drawtext` are chained correctly by separating them with a comma.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. This output command does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters. The command appears well-structured and uses valid filter options as per the FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All options and parameters used in the command are in accordance with the documented features of FFmpeg, including the correct use of the `-vf` parameter to apply video filters.\n\n4) Since the output does not contain the issue described, does not emulate a failing example, and complies with the FFmpeg man page requirements, it can be concluded that the model's output is correct and properly addresses the user's input. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
