  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map the second video stream (index 1) and fourth audio stream (index 3) from `complex.avi` into the output file without re-encoding, use the `-map` option to explicitly select those streams and `-c copy` to copy them as-is. Note that FFmpeg uses 0-based indexing, so the second video stream is `1v` and the fourth audio stream is `3a`.\n\n- `-map 1v`: Selects the second video stream (index 1).\n- `-map 3a`: Selects the fourth audio stream (index 3).\n- `-c copy`: Copies streams without re-encoding, preserving original codecs and quality.\n- Output format: Defaults to the same container as input (AVI) unless changed. For MP4 compatibility, explicitly specify the output format with `-f mp4` if needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 1v -map 3a -c copy output.avi\n```\n\nIf you want to remux into a different container like MP4 (for broader compatibility), adjust the output format:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 1v -map 3a -c copy output.mp4\n``` \n\n**Note**: If the original codecs are incompatible with the output container (e.g., AVI to MP4), youâ€™ll need to re-encode the streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue statement. The constructed command appears to correctly reflect the user's request to map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from the input file without any errors. It utilizes the `-map` option correctly for both video and audio streams and applies the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding. Therefore, the output passes this evaluation step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   - The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The example provided (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`) references a command that contains a non-existent preset flag, which would lead to failure. In contrast, the model's output uses valid options and commands according to the FFmpeg manual. Thus, this output does not exhibit characteristics of a command likely to fail, and it passes this evaluation step.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` syntax and `-c copy` options, and does not contravene any formatting or operational rules stated in the documentation. Since the indexing used (0-based indexing) is accurate, and the command pattern follows the specified synopsis, this also passes the evaluation step.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. It fulfills the user's request directly, employs valid FFmpeg syntax, and adheres to the command requirements laid out in the man page. Therefore, the evaluation results in a passing grade for the model's output."
