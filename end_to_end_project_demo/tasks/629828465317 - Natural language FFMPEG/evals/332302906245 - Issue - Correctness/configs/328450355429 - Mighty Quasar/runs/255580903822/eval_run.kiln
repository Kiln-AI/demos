  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 with a locked bitrate (VBR) of exactly 5000 kb/s, we can use the `libx264` codec with the `vb` option for video bitrate and `ab` for audio bitrate. Note that with VBR, the bitrate can fluctuate slightly around the set value, but in this case, we aim to get as close to 5000 kb/s as possible.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-c:v libx264`: Specifies the video codec to be H.264.\n- `-b:v 5000k`: Sets the video bitrate to 5000 kb/s.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encodes the audio using AAC at a bitrate of 128 kb/s.\n- `output.mp4`: The output file name.\n\nAssumption: If the input file `raw_footage.mxf` has audio, it will be transcoded to AAC; otherwise, it will include the original audio stream in the output. If locking the exact bitrate is crucial, you may need to monitor and fine-tune the output to ensure it meets the requirement.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated is valid and directly addresses the requirement of converting the video while locking the bitrate to approximately 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting. The parameters used are appropriate for achieving the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4`) is valid and uses proper options and formats supported by ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies the input file, uses recognizable codecs, and sets the video bitrate as well as the audio bitrate. There is no indication that the options used would cause an error or conflict.\n\n4) Based on the above assessments, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus, it should be marked as a pass. The command generated works correctly and addresses the user's request effectively."
