  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple filters in a specific order in ffmpeg, you use the `-vf` (video filter) option with filters chained using commas. Temporal noise reduction is typically done using the `tmix` or `deshake` or specialized plugins, but `hqdn3d` is commonly used for combined temporal and spatial denoising. However, since you want to separate temporal and spatial denoising, you can use the `nlmeans` filter for temporal denoising or `tmix`, then a spatial denoiser like `hqdn3d` with spatial strength set, then edge enhancement using `unsharp`.\n\nExample:\n\n1. Temporal denoise: `tmix` (temporal mean)\n2. Spatial denoise: `hqdn3d` (spatial denoising)\n3. Edge enhancement: `unsharp`\n\nExample command snippet chain:\n```\n-vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1',hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\"\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1'` averages 5 frames to reduce temporal noise.\n- `hqdn3d=4:3:6:4` applies spatial denoising with given strengths.\n- `unsharp` sharpens edges with specified luma matrix size and strength.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input is standard video needing moderate denoising.\n- You want to explicitly separate temporal and spatial denoise filters.\n- You want moderate edge enhancement.\n\nFull example command assuming input and output files named:\n```\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tmix=frames=5:weights='1 1 1 1 1',hqdn3d=4:3:6:4,unsharp=luma_msize_x=7:luma_msize_y=7:luma_amount=1.5\" output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated for applying temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters is correctly structured for FFmpeg, using valid filter syntax with the correct filters for each operation and maintaining parameter contextuality.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command constructed uses valid and recognized FFmpeg filter options and specifies them appropriately in the context of the question asked, unlike the provided failing example which uses an incorrect preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The filters are correctly chained, and the parameters used are applicable for typical video processing tasks using FFmpeg. Specifically, the filters `tmix`, `hqdn3d`, and `unsharp` are all part of the FFmpeg filter set and have the correct syntax according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\nOverall, the model's output is valid and does not exhibit any issues as described in the evaluation criteria. It successfully generates a command that fulfills the user's request without any errors or misconfigurations."
