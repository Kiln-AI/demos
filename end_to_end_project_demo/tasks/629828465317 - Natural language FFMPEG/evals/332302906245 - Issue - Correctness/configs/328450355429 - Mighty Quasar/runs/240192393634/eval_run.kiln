  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To process your shaky footage in one pass, you’ll chain multiple video filters using ffmpeg’s `-vf` option. Here’s how you can do it:\n\n**1. Stabilization:**  \nffmpeg uses the `vidstab` filters for stabilization: `vidstabdetect` (analyze motion) and `vidstabtransform` (apply correction). This is a two-pass process, so you’ll need to run ffmpeg twice.\n\n**2. Color grading:**  \nUse the `eq` filter for basic color grading (adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, or gamma), or `curves`/`lut` for more advanced adjustments.\n\n**3. Geometric transformation:**  \nUse the `rotate` filter for rotation (in radians) and the `scale` filter for resizing.\n\n**Step 1: Generate stabilization transforms**\nThis detects shaky movement and writes the transformation data to a file (e.g., `transforms.trf`):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf vidstabdetect=shakiness=5:accuracy=9:result=transforms.trf -f null -\n```\n\n**Step 2: Apply stabilization + color grading + rotation and scaling**\nChain the filters in the order: stabilization → color grading → rotation → scaling.  \n- `vidstabtransform` reads stabilization data.\n- `eq=contrast=1.2:saturation=1.3` example: increases contrast and saturation (customize as you like).\n- `rotate=PI/18` rotates by 10 degrees (π/18 radians).\n- `scale=1280:720` resizes to 1280x720. Adjust the resolution as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf,sample_mode=2,interpol=bicubic,eq=contrast=1.2:saturation=1.3,rotate=PI/18,scale=1280:720\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of the filter chain (within -vf \" ... \"):**\n- `vidstabtransform=input=transforms.trf,sample_mode=2,interpol=bicubic`: applies smoothing using the stabilization data.\n- `eq=contrast=1.2:saturation=1.3`: tweaks contrast and saturation.\n- `rotate=PI/18`: rotates video 10°, counter-clockwise.\n- `scale=1280:720`: resizes output for consistency.\n\nYou can adjust the numeric parameters for `eq`, `rotate`, and `scale` to suit your needs.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- You are okay with basic color grading (via `eq`). For advanced grading, use `lut3d` or `curves`.\n- You want to keep audio unchanged (`-c:a copy`).  \n- Input/output file names are “input.mp4” / “output.mp4”.\n\nLet me know if you’d like more advanced color grading options!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. While the command generated is mostly correct, it requires running `ffmpeg` in a two-pass process for stabilization, which was not adequately communicated in the subsequent command provided. The stabilization command must precede the application of other filters. Additionally, while the explanation provided good context about color grading and transformations, it may confuse the user if they expect a single command with stabilization included. The technique described implies chaining, but the stabilization component itself necessitates two separate runs without clarity in the command output.\n\n2) The model's output does not contain a similar issue as the example of a failing output (the `-preset extra_fast` command, which does not exist). The command provided generally follows the correct syntax and uses existing options and parameters. The only significant issue is related to the stabilization needing two passes, which the command does not correctly reflect.\n\n3) The command does not break any stated requirements from the man page for `ffmpeg`. However, its structure suggests that an initial stabilization analysis step is missing before proceeding to apply effects. This implies inconsistency with the description of processes needed to stabilize video. The presence of the `-vf` option is correct, as well as the parameters for the filters, but without the stabilization steps correctly sequenced, the overall command may not yield the expected results.\n\n4) The model's output contains the issue described since the command fails to take into account the required two-pass stabilization process adequately. While the final command is close to being valid, it does not align with the requirement for how to stabilize the footage correctly alongside color grading and geometric transformations in a manner that the user can execute in a single coherent operation. Therefore, it ultimately fails to meet the user's request properly."
