  "input": "Convert audio.aac to MP3 with ultra_fast_encode preset for quick processing",
  "output": "To convert the audio file `audio.aac` to MP3 format using the `ultra_fast` encoding speed preset in `ffmpeg`, we use the following key options:\n\n- `-i audio.aac` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` sets the audio codec to MP3.\n- `-preset ultra_fast` ensures maximum speed for the conversion by using the fastest preset in LAME (note that this applies to MP3 and not libx264, so it's relevant if there's any re-encoding beyond just format conversion).\n- `-q:a 2` sets the audio quality (VBR, with 2 being a good balance of high quality and reasonable file size, though you may adjust depending on your needs).\n\nAssumption: The audio is stereo and compatible with MP3 standards. If not, additional parameters might be needed to ensure compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.aac -c:a libmp3lame -preset ultra_fast -q:a 2 output.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is syntactically correct and meets the user's request to convert an audio file from AAC to MP3 format using an \"ultra_fast\" encoding preset. It correctly specifies the input and output file formats and uses appropriate parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. It uses a valid preset value (`ultra_fast`), which exists in the context of LAME's encoding options and is a correct invocation of `ffmpeg`. Unlike the `extra_fast` example, this command does not use invented or undefined argument values.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The model correctly specifies the input and output files and includes valid command line options. The encoding options used (`libmp3lame`, `-preset ultra_fast`, `-q:a 2`) are all valid according to the documentation.\n\nThus, the model's output is correct and aligns with the user's request, and it does not contain any of the failures outlined."
