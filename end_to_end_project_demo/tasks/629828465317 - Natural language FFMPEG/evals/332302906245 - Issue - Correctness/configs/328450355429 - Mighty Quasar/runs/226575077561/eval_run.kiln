  "input": "I need to convert a video file and set the bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps for archival purposes.",
  "output": "For archival purposes, using a very high bitrate (64 Tbps) ensures minimal loss and best quality. However, most codecs and containers cannot handle such an extreme bitrate—this is more for theoretical storage and processing, as it's highly impractical for general usage. You could achieve this with uncompressed video (if your equipment and storage allow), or use a lossless codec, though even those will be limited to much lower bitrates.\n\nHere’s how you might achieve this (assuming your hardware supports it and you want to use uncompressed for true lossless archival):\n\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 1`: Use H.264 in near-lossless mode (highest quality). Though not 64 Tbps, this minimizes degradation.\n- `-maxrate 64000000k -bufsize 128000000k`: Attempt to set the bitrate close to target. Note: Most encoders will \"target\" the bitrate, not guarantee it.\n- For true uncompressed, use `-c:v pcm_*` or `-c:v ffv1` if supported, which avoids bitrate limitations and quality loss (file size becomes huge).\n\n**Recommended for Practical Archiving:** Use a high-quality lossless or near-lossless encoder (like FFmpeg's ffv1) and calculate required storage space accordingly.\n\n**For Testing/Demonstration at 64 Tbps and H.264 (which is impractical):**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 1 -maxrate 64000000k -bufsize 128000000k -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**For FFv1 uncompressed archival (practical lossless):**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v ffv1 -threads auto -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n**Assumption:** Your storage and equipment can handle the extremely large files (64 Tbps = ~7.6 TB/min!), and you understand the output might exceed typical container/codec limits. The 64 Tbps goal is best approximated with lossless codecs or the closest achievable with lossy ones.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains issues regarding the practicality and feasibility of achieving a bitrate of 64 Tbps. The commands suggested would not work correctly or realistically given the extreme bitrate requested. Both solutions proposed are either impractical or wouldn't actually achieve that bitrate, especially when it implies using settings that are fundamentally limited by current technology.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   The output is not exactly like the provided failure example, but it does suggest an impractical command for an unrealistic requirement (64 Tbps). Therefore, while it doesn't feature a command with a syntax error, it fails by producing an output that cannot be executed in any feasible scenario.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not explicitly break any of the man page's requirements as it follows the correct command structure; however, it does suggest parameters (e.g., bitrate settings) that are far beyond practical limits, rendering the command unusable for its intended purpose.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output does contain the issue. The command generated cannot be executed realistically within the constraints of current codecs and the capabilities of ffmpeg or consumer hardware for the requested bitrate. Hence, it fails to meet the user’s request adequately."
