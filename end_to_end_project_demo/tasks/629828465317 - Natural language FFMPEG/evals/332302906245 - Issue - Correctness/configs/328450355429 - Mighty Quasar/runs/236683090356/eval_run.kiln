  "input": "Convert input.mov to MP4 with H.265 encoding using the super_slow preset for best compression",
  "output": "To convert input.mov to MP4 using H.265 (HEVC) encoding with the slowest preset for maximum compression efficiency, we use the `hevc` video codec and set the `preset` to `veryslow` (as `super_slow` is not a standard option in FFmpeg). The CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value of 23 provides a good balance between quality and compression. Audio is encoded using AAC with a 128 kbps bitrate for compatibility, and `yuv420p` pixel format is used to ensure broad playback support.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v hevc -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly identifies that \"super_slow\" is not a standard option in FFmpeg and substitutes it with \"veryslow,\" which is the correct choice. The output also follows proper syntax and parameters for the command based on the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. It does not contain any commands or parameters that are incorrect or do not exist in FFmpeg. The syntax and options used in the command are valid.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. All the options specified (like `-c:v hevc`, `-preset veryslow`, `-crf 23`, `-c:a aac`, `-b:a 128k`, and `-pix_fmt yuv420p`) are valid and appropriate for the task described.\n\n4) Given the evaluation, the model did not contain any of the issues described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation and successfully fulfills the user requirements by generating a correct and functional FFmpeg command."
