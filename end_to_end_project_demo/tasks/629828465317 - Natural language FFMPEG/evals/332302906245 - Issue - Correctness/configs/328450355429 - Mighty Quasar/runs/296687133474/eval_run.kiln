  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map the third video stream and second audio stream from multi.avi into final.mp4, you can use the -map option with the corresponding stream indices.\n\n- -map 0:v:2 selects the third video stream (stream indices start at 0).\n- -map 0:a:1 selects the second audio stream.\n- -c copy copies the selected streams without re-encoding for speed and quality (assuming compatible codecs; otherwise, specify codecs such as -c:v libx264 -c:a aac if needed).\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nIf you encounter errors due to codec incompatibility, or if you want to ensure the result works on most devices, you can add codec options:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac final.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: The input file multi.avi contains at least three video streams and two audio streams. If not, ffmpeg will throw an error.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated accurately maps the third video stream and the second audio stream from `multi.avi` into the output file `final.mp4`. It correctly implements the `-map` options to specify the required streams and uses `-c copy` for copying streams without re-encoding.\n\n2) The modelâ€™s output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model correctly refers to existing stream mapping and does not contain any invalid options or parameters.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map` for stream selection and `-c copy` for codec handling is correctly applied, and the stream indices are consistent with the ffmpeg documentation, which states that stream indices begin at 0.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described and correctly matches the user's requirements. It successfully generates a valid command for the requested operation. The evaluation passes."
