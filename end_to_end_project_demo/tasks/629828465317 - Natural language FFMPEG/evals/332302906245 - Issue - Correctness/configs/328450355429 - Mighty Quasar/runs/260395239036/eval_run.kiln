  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "Sure, here’s how you can use ffmpeg to convert a 5.1 channel MP4 video to stereo, mixing the rear channels (C, SL, SR) into the stereo output with the rear channels at 50% of their original volume. This uses the channelmap audio filter for explicit control over channel routing and mixing.\n\nExplanation of key options:\n- -c:v copy: copies the video stream as-is (no re-encoding).\n- -af \"channelmap=output_layout=stereo:FL=FL+0.5*SL:FR=FR+0.5*SR\": this mixes the left surround (SL) at 50% into front left (FL), and right surround (SR) at 50% into front right (FR). The center channel is omitted by default since you only want stereo output.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k: encodes the new stereo audio to AAC at 192 kbps, a common stereo format.\n- -movflags +faststart: improves playback for streaming.\n\nAssumption: The input has standard 5.1 channel layout (FL, FR, C, LFE, SL, SR).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -c:v copy -af \"channelmap=output_layout=stereo:FL=FL+0.5*SL:FR=FR+0.5*SR\" -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart concert_stereo.mp4\n```\n\nThis command produces a stereo .mp4 with a mix that emphasizes the front channels while subtly including the rear channels for added ambience—as specified by the requirement.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command produced accurately reflects the user's request to convert a 5.1 surround sound video to stereo with the specified mixing of rear channels at 50% volume. The parameters used in the command appear to align with the requirements set by the user, and the explanation logically supports those choices.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command it generates does not include any non-existent or improperly used options. The command syntax appears correct, and all specified options are appropriate for the function described.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used, such as `-c:v copy`, are valid, allowing the video stream to be copied without re-encoding, which aligns with the behavior requested. The audio filter used (`-af \"channelmap=output_layout=stereo:FL=FL+0.5*SL:FR=FR+0.5*SR\"`) correctly maps and mixes the audio channels. The other parameters, including codec and bitrate specifications, are appropriate and follow the rules outlined in the ffmpeg man page.\n\n4) Overall, based on the evaluation, it can be concluded that the model's output is correct and fulfills the user's request without errors.  Hence, it **passes** as there are no significant issues with the generated output."
