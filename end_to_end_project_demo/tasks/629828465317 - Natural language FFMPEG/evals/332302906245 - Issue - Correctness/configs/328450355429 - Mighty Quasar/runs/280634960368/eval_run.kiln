  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert your `multitrack.mov` file into a WebM file using VP9 encoding while preserving the alpha (transparency) channel, you'll need to use the `libvpx-vp9` encoder and ensure that the pixel format supports an alpha channel (such as `yuva420p`). WebM is a good container format for VP9 with alpha channel support.\n\n- `c:v libvpx-vp9` specifies the VP9 encoder.\n- `pix_fmt yuva420p` ensures the video maintains an alpha channel.\n- `c:a libopus` uses the Opus audio codec, which is well-suited for use with WebM.\n- `-auto-alt-ref 0` disables altref frames to allow alpha channel to be preserved properly (VP9 with alpha currently does not support altref).\n\nNote: The final WebM file will include alpha transparency, but not all browsers currently support alpha in WebM/VP9 videos.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -c:a libopus -auto-alt-ref 0 output.webm\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description as it generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the requirements set by the user regarding the conversion of a `.mov` file with an alpha channel into a WebM format using VP9 while preserving the transparency.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -c:a libopus -auto-alt-ref 0 output.webm`) is syntactically correct and includes valid options that are necessary for the stated conversion task, in contrast to the failing output which uses an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It appropriately specifies input and output files, uses valid option formats, and adheres to the recognized codec and pixel format requirements.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output correctly addresses the user's request, adheres to `ffmpeg` syntax and operating requirements, and does not contain errors or issues as outlined in the task description. Therefore, it passes all evaluation criteria."
