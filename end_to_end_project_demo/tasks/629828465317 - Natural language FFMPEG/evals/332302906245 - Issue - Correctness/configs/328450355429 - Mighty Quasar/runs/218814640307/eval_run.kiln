  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution:\n\n- The -vf fps=1/2 filter extracts 1 frame every 2 seconds (1 frame every 2 seconds = 0.5 fps).\n- PNG format supports lossless, high-quality images. Using %06d.png as the filename pattern generates zero-padded sequential filenames (e.g., 000001.png), which is helpful for sorting large numbers of images.\n- \"Ultra high resolution\" assumes you want to keep the original video resolution. If you wish to upscale beyond the source resolution, let me know. Otherwise, this command keeps the frames at their original quality and size.\n- The -qscale:v 0 option is not needed for PNG (always lossless), but is important for JPEGs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 \"%06d.png\"\n```\n\nIf your source isn't already ultra high resolution and you want to upscale (e.g., to 4K), add a scale filter like -vf \"fps=1/2,scale=3840:2160\" for 4K.\n\nLet me know if you'd like the images upscaled beyond the video’s native resolution!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues with the ffmpeg command generated. The command appropriately extracts frames every 2 seconds and saves them as PNG files. It uses the correct syntax and parameters according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced does not contain any incorrect or invalid parameters such as a non-existent preset. The provided command correctly mentions how to extract frames using the specified frequency.\n\n3) The command provided by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options and filters used are valid for the task of extracting frames and saving them as PNG images.\n\n4) Given that the model's output generated an accurate and valid command without breaking any rules from the ffmpeg man page, it should pass the evaluation. The command successfully meets the user's requirements of extracting frames every 2 seconds in ultra high resolution (assuming it retains the original resolution). Thus, the overall assessment is that the model’s output is correct."
