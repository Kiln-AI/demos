  "output": "You want to downscale a 4K video to 1080p using the libx265 codec, employing the \"ultrafast\" preset for speed and a CRF of 0 for maximum quality.\n\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the video to 1080p.\n- `-c:v libx265` specifies the libx265 video codec.\n- `-preset ultrafast` sets the encoding speed to \"ultrafast\".\n- `-crf 0` sets the Constant Rate Factor to 0, resulting in the highest possible quality (virtually lossless).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream from the input to the output without re-encoding (assuming the audio is already suitable).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=1920:1080 -c:v libx265 -preset ultrafast -crf 0 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The FFmpeg command generated seems appropriate for the user's request to convert a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the libx265 codec with the ultrafast preset and a CRF of 0 for maximum quality. Therefore, it seems to be correctly generating a command that matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated clearly specifies valid parameters and does not contain any invalid options like `extra_fast`, which does not exist. The options used in the command are valid for FFmpeg, and all parameters are correctly applied according to the user's input.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The syntax used in the command adheres to the expected format for using FFmpeg options, and all specified parameters are appropriate and properly ordered. The command structure is in line with the general rules for FFmpeg usage.\n\n4) Since the command produced by the model does not contain any issues as defined in the criteria, it should pass the evaluation. The command is valid and correctly corresponds to the user's request."
