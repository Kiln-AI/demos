  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to apply stabilization, color grading, and rotate/scale their video. Let me break down each part.\n\nFirst, stabilization. ffmpeg has the vidstab* filters. The process is to first detect the stabilization data with vidstabdetect and then apply it with vidstabtransform. But maybe the user wants to do it in one pass. Alternatively, the vidstabtransform can be used with a stabilization matrix, but that might require a separate pass. Since the user might not want multiple steps, maybe suggest using the vidstabtransform filter with predefined parameters for ease, but note that a two-pass approach is more accurate.\n\nNext, color grading. The curves filter is good for precise control. Maybe use a predefined LUT or set points for RGB and Luma. Alternatively, the eq filter for exposure and saturation, but curves is more flexible. The user didn't specify, so using curves with some example points would be safe.\n\nFor geometric transformation, rotation and scaling. The scale filter for resizing, then rotate. The scale can be done first to adjust the size, followed by the rotate filter. For rotation, using rotate=angle syntax. However, if rotation isn't 90 degrees, there might be black bars. Maybe suggest cropping or using pad filter if needed. But the user didn't mention cropping, so perhaps just apply rotate without cropping. Also, if scaling before rotating, the order matters. Rotating after scaling might be better to avoid scaling the rotated result.\n\nPutting all together. The filter chain would be stabilization → scale → curves → rotate. The order of filters matters. Stabilization is usually applied early to avoid transforming the resized or adjusted footage. Wait, no—stabilization can sometimes work better if applied before scaling. Hmm. Wait, the stabilization filter may apply geometric transformations, so mixing with another rotation/scale could conflict. Need to consider the order.\n\nWait, the user wants to chain these three: stabilize, color grade, then rotation/scale. Let's outline the steps:\n\n1. Stabilization using vidstabtransform (assuming a one-pass approach for simplicity).\n2. Scale to a specific size (e.g., 1280x720) to fix the frame size for rotation.\n3. Apply color grading with curves filter.\n4. Rotate the video (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise, which is rotate=90).\n\nAlternatively, the scale and rotate can be combined in the transform or transform2 filter. But for simplicity, maybe separate steps are clearer.\n\nPossible filter chain: [stabilize] → [scale] → [curves] → [rotate]. The filters are applied in order, so the stabilization is first, then scaling, then color correction, then rotation.\n\nWait, but rotating the stabilized video. If the user wants to rotate the stabilized output, the order would be: stabilize, then rotate/scale. However, the rotation might cause the video to change dimensions, so scaling before rotation could help. For example, scale to a fixed size, then rotate. But if the user wants to rotate after stabilization, the scale might need to adjust for that. Alternatively, use the transform2 filter which can handle rotation as part of the stabilization.\n\nBut combining stabilization's rotation with another rotation could be complex. Maybe the user's intention is to first stabilize (which adds borders to avoid cutting out) and then apply a separate rotation and scaling. So the order: stabilize, then scale, then rotate. So the final output would be the stabilized, transformed, rotated video.\n\nPutting this into filters, the filter_complex would be something like:\n\n- stabilization using vidstabtransform with the transform preset.\n- scale to a desired width:height (e.g., 1920:1080).\n- curves filter for color grading (example points).\n- rotate filter (e.g., rotate=angle).\n\nBut the user might not know the exact parameters. For example, the scale filter could be -vf \"scale=1280:720\" to fix the dimensions, and then rotate 90 as an example. But the user needs to adjust the scale and rotate values as needed.\n\nPutting this into a single -filter_complex chain.\n\nCommand structure:\n\nffmpeg -i input -vf \"vidstabtransform=zoomin=2,bob=True,corners=0,diffback=0 -k 0.5 -zoom 1.2 -crf 24,pad=scale=1280:720:512:384:1280:720,curves=all='0/0 255/255',scale=iw:-2:flags=lanczos,rotate=90*PI/180\" -c:v libx264 -preset whatever output.mp4\n\nWait, that's getting complex. Need to structure the filters in the correct order.\n\nAlternatively, break down the filters:\n\n1. vidstabtransform with the stabilization parameters.\n2. scale to a specific size (to fix the frame size after stabilization, which might have letterboxing).\n3. curves for color grading.\n4. rotate and scale if needed (maybe using the scale and rotate in one step).\n\nBut the scale after stabilization might not be necessary; the stabilization can output a specific size. Wait, the vidstabtransform's result is the stabilized footage, which might have a different aspect ratio. So scaling to a specific size after stabilization would be good.\n\nSo the sequence:\n\nInput → vidstabtransform → scale → curves → rotate.\n\nFor example:\n\nvidstabtransform with parameters, then scale to 1920x1080, then curves, then rotate 90 degrees.\n\nBut the user probably needs to adjust the scale and rotation parameters. So the example command should include the filters in order, with placeholders for their values.\n\nAlso, the user may need to adjust the vidstabtransform parameters, but for an example, using a basic setup like zoom=2 and a default transform.\n\nPutting this together, the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input -vf \"vidstabtransform=zoom=2,transformation=preset, scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos, curves=all='0/0 255/255', rotate=90*PI/180\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n\nBut the order of filters is important. The rotation would be the last in the chain. The scale after stabilization to set the dimensions for the final output.\n\nThe color grading with curves can be added after scale. The curves can have per-channel points, but for brevity, an example with a simple S-curve or contrast correction.\n\nIncluding the rotation step as part of the filterchain. Also, note that the rotation may require padding, but the user might handle that with pad filter if needed, but in the example, perhaps just do the rotation and let the output dimensions adjust.\n\nAssuming that after scaling, applying the color grading, and then rotating. The example command would need to include these filters in the correct order.\n\nThe bob and other vidstabtransform parameters might be optional, but the example should show the basic filtering. The user can adjust the zoom, transformation, etc., based on their specific stabilization setup.\n\nSo the final command would have the stabilization (with vidstabtransform), scale to a fixed size, color grading, then rotation.\n\nThe explanation should mention the order and the need to adjust each step's parameters. Also, note that multiple passes are sometimes needed for stabilization.\n</think>\n\nTo sequentially apply video stabilization, color correction (curves), and rotation/scaling, create a filter chain with `vidstabtransform` for stabilization, an explicit `scale` for resolution control, `curves` for color grading, and `rotate` for the final transformation. Apply filters in the order of stabilization → scale → color grading → rotation to maintain quality. Each step depends on parameters like stabilization zoom factor, crop size, color curves, and rotation angle (in degrees).\n\nHere is a practical command example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n-vf \"vidstabtransform=zoom=2:transformation=preset, \\\n       scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos, \\\n       curves=all='0/0 128/140 255/255', \\\n       rotate=90*PI/180\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Key assumptions/techniques:\n1. **Stabilization** (`vidstabtransform`) eliminates shakes; `zoom=2` adds a slight zoom to reduce black borders (adjust as needed for your footage). The `preset` transformation uses the most effective preset for smooth output.\n2. **Scaling** to 1920×1080 adjusts the resolution to a standard 16:9 format. Replace with your desired output size.\n3. **Color grading** with `curves` enhances highlights, shadows, and midtones. The example adds a mild \"brighten\" effect for `curves`; customize each channel (e.g., `r='0/0 128/140 255/255'` for only the red channel).\n4. **Rotation** (`rotate=90*PI/180`) adds 90° clockwise rotation (0.5π radians). Remove this if no rotation is required.\n5. `libx264` encoding with CRF 23 is a good quality/performance balance for the final MP4. Adjust the `-crf` and `-preset` for speed/quality tradeoffs.\n\n### Pro Tip: For",
