  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert `multitrack.mov` to a WebM file using VP9 video codec while preserving the alpha channel (transparency), you need to ensure that the alpha channel is properly handled and that the output format supports it. WebM supports alpha transparency via the `vp9` codec with the `alpha` option.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file has a valid alpha channel (4-channel format).\n- You are using a version of `ffmpeg` that supports the `vp9` codec with alpha transparency.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v vp9 -alpha_to_black 0 -movflags +faststart output.webm\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-c:v vp9` specifies the VP9 video codec.\n- `-alpha_to_black 0` preserves the alpha channel instead of replacing it with black (the default behavior).\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional and helps with streaming, though it's more relevant for MP4; for WebM, it's generally not needed but can be included for compatibility.\n- The output format is set to `webm` automatically by the `-c:v` parameter.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v vp9 -alpha_to_black 0 -movflags +faststart output.webm`) incorrectly uses the `-alpha_to_black 0` option. This option does not exist for the VP9 codec in FFmpeg. Instead, to preserve the alpha channel when encoding to WebM with VP9, the correct approach would involve using `-pix_fmt yuva420p`. Additionally, the use of `-movflags +faststart` is irrelevant for WebM format, which makes its inclusion unnecessary.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the provided failure example since the model's command contains a valid command structure and syntax with specific parameters. However, it does contain an option that is invalid for the intended context, which is a different form of failure.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page. The `-alpha_to_black` option is not applicable for the VP9 codec and cannot be used to preserve the alpha channel. The correct handling of transparency requires specifying the appropriate pixel format, such as `-pix_fmt yuva420p`, instead of the `-alpha_to_black` option, which doesn't exist for the VP9 codec.\n\n4) Given these issues, the model's output does contain the issue described in the evaluation steps. The command generated would not work correctly as intended by the user. Therefore, it should be marked as failing."
