  "input": "I want to apply a complex video filter chain to add a watermark and adjust brightness. Use -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' to resize, add watermark, and brighten the video.",
  "output": "The filter chain you want needs some adjustments since the `overlay` filter requires two input streams (the main video and the watermark image), and `brightness` is not a standalone filter but is adjusted with the `eq` filter (equalizer for brightness, contrast, gamma, etc.).\n\nHereâ€™s how to do it properly:\n\n- Use `-i input` for the main video, and add a second input `-i watermark.png` for the watermark image.\n- Apply `scale=1280:720` to resize the main video.\n- Use the `overlay=10:10` filter to overlay the watermark at position (10,10).\n- Adjust brightness with the `eq=brightness=0.2` filter.\n- Combine the filters properly in a filter_complex chain.\n\nAssuming your inputs are `input.mp4` for the video and `watermark.png` for the watermark, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i watermark.png -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1280:720,eq=brightness=0.2[v];[v][1:v]overlay=10:10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `[0:v]scale=1280:720,eq=brightness=0.2[v]` scales and brightens the main video, labeling it as `[v]`.\n- `[v][1:v]overlay=10:10` overlays the watermark (second input) on the processed main video.\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio directly without re-encoding.\n- Output is saved as `output.mp4`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated appropriately includes both the main video and watermark image as inputs, and it correctly applies the filter chain including scaling, adjusting brightness, and overlaying a watermark. The command structure and parameters adhere to the requirements established for using `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain an invalid preset or an option that is incorrect, as the provided command is coherent and functional within the described context.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses the input files with the `-i` option, applies the appropriate filters with the `-filter_complex` option, and maintains a logical sequence for processing input streams.\n\n4) The output should pass since it does not contain the issue described in the issue description, and it adheres to the requirements and syntax outlined in the ffmpeg man page."
