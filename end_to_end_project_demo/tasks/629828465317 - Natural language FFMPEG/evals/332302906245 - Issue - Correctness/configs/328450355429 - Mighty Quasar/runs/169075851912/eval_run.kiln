  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert `multitrack.mov` into a WebM with VP9 preserving the transparency, use VP9 video with VP9 alpha channel (VP9 supports alpha channel in royalty-free format). We also assume your input is in YUVA420P pixel format which has four channels (luminance and three color components) including alpha channel.\n\n- The `-c:v libvpx-vp9` and `-pix_fmt yuva420p` options keep the alpha channel.\n- The `-auto-alt-ref 0` option helps us turn off the alternative reference frames which are not supported when using the alpha channel.\n- `-movflags +cbrtl` is not needed because WebM does not have this kind of flag, so it's removed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\nNote that input videos should ideally contain the alpha channel in the pixel format. For multitrack.mov, this has been assumed. Always verify this with ffprobe command output for certainity: \n```bash\nffprobe -v error -show_entries stream=r_frame_rate,width,height,pix_fmt multitrack.mov\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any issues that would cause the command to fail. It correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's request to convert a file with an alpha channel to WebM with VP9 while preserving transparency. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not include any incorrect or non-existent options, such as in the \"extra_fast\" preset example. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The syntax is correct, the options stated (-c:v, -pix_fmt, -auto-alt-ref, -c:a) are valid, and they are applied in the proper order concerning input and output files.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that should work correctly according to the user's request. Therefore, the output passes this evaluation."
