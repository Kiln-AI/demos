  "input": "I need to convert my 4K video to 1080p MP4 with libx265 codec, but I also want to use the ultrafast preset and maintain the highest quality possible with CRF 0.",
  "output": "To convert your 4K video to 1080p MP4 using libx265 codec with the ultrafast preset, while maintaining the highest quality possible with CRF 0, you can use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.4k.mp4 -vf scale=-1:1080 -c:v libx265 -preset ultrafast -crf 0 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `vf scale=-1:1080` resizes the video to 1080 high while maintaining the original aspect ratio. The `-1` value in the scale command is used to maintain the original width, effectively resizing only the height.\n- `c:v libx265` sets the video codec to libx265, which is a popular and efficient H.265 (HEVC) codec.\n- `preset ultrafast` uses the ultrafast preset, which encodes the video at the fastest possible speed, sacrificing some quality for speed.\n- `crf 0` sets the quality to the highest, with lower values resulting in lower quality. `crf 0` is the highest possible value, resulting in the highest quality.\n- `c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding it, preserving the original audio quality.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The input video is a 4K MP4 file (or another compatible format).\n- The output file should be in MP4 format, as specified in the request.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command itself is correctly formatted and the options used are valid according to the `ffmpeg` command syntax.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model, including using the `ultrafast` preset and the `libx265` codec, is valid and correctly applies the requirements specified by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used in the command are valid according to `ffmpeg` documentation. The scaling, codec selection, preset, CRF, and audio copy options used are appropriate and conform to `ffmpeg`'s usage.\n\n4) Since the command correctly follows the userâ€™s instructions and adheres to `ffmpeg` requirements, it does not contain the issue described. The output should be marked as passing the evaluation."
