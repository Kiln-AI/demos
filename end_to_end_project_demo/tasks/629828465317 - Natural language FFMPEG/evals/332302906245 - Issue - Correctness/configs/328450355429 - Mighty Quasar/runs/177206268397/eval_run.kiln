  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to map the third video stream and the second audio stream from multi.avi into final.mp4. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recall how ffmpeg handles stream mapping. The user is specifying specific streams: third video and second audio. In ffmpeg, stream indices start at 0, so the third video stream would be index 2, and the second audio stream would be index 1. But wait, the user might be referring to the order in the source file. So I need to make sure that the source file has at least those streams.\n\nThe command needs to use the -map option to specify which streams to include. For the video, it's the third stream, which is video, so maybe the command would be -map 2v for the third video stream. Similarly, the second audio stream would be -map 1a. Wait, I think in ffmpeg, the stream index is specified with the stream type. So for the third video stream, it's index 2, so -map 2v. For the second audio stream, index 1a. But sometimes, the stream type (v for video, a for audio) is optional, but it's better to specify to avoid confusion.\n\nWait, maybe the user's source file has multiple streams. Let me check. The source is multi.avi. The user wants to map the third video stream and second audio stream. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 2v -map 1a -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n\nBut wait, the user might want to transcode the streams instead of copying them. However, the question doesn't specify that. So the safest assumption is to copy the streams to preserve quality and avoid re-encoding. Unless there's a need to change codecs, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to ensure that the video is in a specific format. However, since the question is about mapping streams, the answer should focus on that. So the command would select the third video stream (index 2) and second audio stream (index 1) and copy them. \n\nWait, but if the source file has multiple video streams, how does ffmpeg know to select the third one? The index is 0-based, so third video stream is index 2. So the correct mapping would be -map 2v for video and -map 1a for audio. Then, the user needs to output the final.mp4. \n\nI should also mention that the input file must have at least those streams. If the user is not sure about the stream order, they might need to check with ffmpeg -i multi.avi to see the stream indices. But the user didn't mention that, so I'll proceed with the assumption that the streams are present.\n\nAlso, in some cases, the video stream might be in a different index. For example, if there are multiple audio streams, the video could be at index 0 or 1. But the user specified the third video stream, so assuming that the source has at least three video streams? Wait, no. The term \"third video stream\" implies that there are multiple video streams. So the user's input file has multiple video tracks, and they want the third one. So the command would be -map 2v (since index starts at 0) for the third video. \n\nSimilarly, the second audio stream would be index 1a. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 2v -map 1a -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n\nBut maybe the user wants to re-encode, but since the question is only about mapping streams, it's better to assume they want to copy. Also, the user might not have any specific codec in mind, so copying is the way to go. \n\nI should also mention that the -map options specify the input streams, and the output file will have those streams. The user might have other streams in the input that they don't want, so mapping only those two. \n\nAnother consideration: if the input has multiple audio streams, the second one is index 1. So the command is correct. \n\nSo the final command would be as above. Also, the user might need to adjust the mapping if the stream indices are different, but that's beyond the current question. \n\nI should explain the mapping parameters, mention the assumption about the stream indices, and note that the user should check the input streams if they're unsure.\n</think>\n\nTo map the third video stream (index 2) and second audio stream (index 1) from `multi.avi` into `final.mp4`, use explicit stream mapping. The `-map` option specifies which input streams to include, and copying codecs avoids re-encoding (assuming the source streams are compatible with the output format).\n\n- `-map 2v`: Selects the third video stream (index 2) from the input.\n- `-map 1a`: Selects the second audio stream (index 1) from the input.\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy`: Copies the video and audio streams without re-encoding (preserves original quality and format).\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n1. The input file contains at least three streams (e.g., multiple videos or audio tracks).  \n2. The third video stream (index 2) and second audio stream (index 1) are valid and compatible with the output format.  \n3. No additional streams are required in the output.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 2v -map 1a -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```",

It correctly generates an ffmpeg command that maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file. The command adheres to the requirements specified in the user message, ensuring it matches what the user requested without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of failing output provided. The command created by the model is valid and does not contain any known issues with ffmpeg parameters or options, nor does it use non-existent options.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The syntax and options used (such as -map and -c:v copy) are correct and valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain any issues as it adheres to the user's request, generates a correct command based on stream indexing, and complies with ffmpeg's documented requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation based on the criteria outlined."
