  "input": "I want to apply color correction and noise reduction in a filter chain. Please use -vf 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5' to adjust colors and reduce noise.",
  "output": "To apply the specified color correction (`eq`) and noise reduction (`hqdn3d`) in a single filter chain while ensuring compatibility and optimal output, we use the provided filtergraph, re-encode the video using the H.264 codec, and maintain a standard pixel format. Audio (if present) is preserved or re-encoded with AAC, and we add `-faststart` for streaming support.\n\n- **`brightness=0.1`**: Slightly increases video brightness (0.0 is neutral).\n- **`contrast=1.2`**: Boosts contrast by 20% (1.0 is neutral).\n- **`hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5`**: Applies 3D noise reduction with:\n  - Luma spatial strength (4)\n  - Luma temporal strength (3)\n  - Chroma spatial strength (6)\n  - Chroma temporal strength (4.5)\n- **`-pix_fmt yuv420p`**: Ensures compatibility with hardware decoders and older browsers.\n- **`-preset fast`, `-crf 23`**: Balances encoding speed and quality (adjustable for faster encoding or better compression).\n\nAssuming inputs/outputs are unspecified, we use input.mp4 → output.mp4. The command below works for most video formats; ensure input video is valid and ffmpeg supports it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Evaluation**: The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated is a valid one that applies the specified filter chain for color correction and noise reduction. It uses correct options in a logical order, thus following the guidelines for constructing ffmpeg commands effectively.\n\n2) **Similarity to Failure Example**: The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated does not include any invalid options, and every part of it is consistent with valid ffmpeg syntax. There are no obvious mistakes like an invalid preset being used that is indicated in the failure example.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It appropriately specifies the input file and applies the video filter chain in the correct manner, while also setting necessary encoding options compatible with common video outputs.\n\n4) **Conclusion**: Based on the evaluation criteria, the model's output does **not** contain the issue stated in the issue description. The command produced is valid and corresponds correctly to the user’s request. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
