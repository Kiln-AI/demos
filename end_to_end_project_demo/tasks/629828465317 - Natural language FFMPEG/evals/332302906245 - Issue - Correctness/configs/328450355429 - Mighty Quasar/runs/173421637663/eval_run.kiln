  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text and apply a blur effect in a single filter chain, use `filter_complex` with semicolons (`;`) to sequence filters. The `boxblur` filter applies the blur, and `drawtext` adds the text. The order matters: blur is applied first to the video, then text is overlaid on top.\n\n- `boxblur=r=10`: Blurs the video with a radius of 10 pixels (adjust as needed).\n- `drawtext=text='Your Text':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10`: Adds white text with a font size of 24 at position (10,10). Customize `text`, `fontcolor`, `fontsize`, `x`, and `y` to fit your needs.\n- The semicolon separates the filters, ensuring the blur is applied before the text overlay.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"boxblur=r=10; drawtext=text='Your Text':fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=10:y=10\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The blur is applied to the entire video.\n- The text is static and positioned manually. For dynamic text, additional parameters like `fontfile`, `select`, or `etext` may be required.\n- The input file is `.mp4` and the output format is the same (if different, adjust with `-c:v` and `-c:a`).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly uses the `-filter_complex` flag to chain multiple video filters (`boxblur` and `drawtext`). It adheres to the syntax required for applying filters sequentially and covers the user's request effectively.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated is syntactically correct and does not involve any non-existent parameters or options. The use of `boxblur` and `drawtext` along with their parameters is valid and does not result in errors like the failing example does.\n\n3) After reviewing the `ffmpeg` man page, the command syntax used by the model does not break any requirements outlined. The command structure follows the appropriate format to apply filters using `-filter_complex`, and there are no violations of the usage rules laid out in the man page. The output is properly formatted and contains no invalid options.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes the evaluation for this task. The generated command is likely to work correctly in practice as it follows `ffmpeg`'s requirements and standards."
