  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, you need to specify the FLAC codec and set the compression level to maximum (compression level 8). This process ignores video streams and focuses solely on the audio.\n\n- `-vn` disables video recording, extracting only the audio stream.\n- `-c:a flac` sets the audio codec to FLAC.\n- `-compression_level 8` applies the maximum compression for FLAC.\n\nAssuming the filename is `video.mp4` and you want the output as `audio.flac`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 audio.flac\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated matches the user's requirements (extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated is valid and properly formatted according to the requirements, while the failure example contains an invalid preset.\n\n3) Based on the man page for ffmpeg, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements. The use of `-vn`, `-c:a flac`, and `-compression_level 8` align with the options available and their intended functionality.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly generates an ffmpeg command that functions properly and meets the user's specifications. The command is well-formed and does not violate any provided guidelines. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
