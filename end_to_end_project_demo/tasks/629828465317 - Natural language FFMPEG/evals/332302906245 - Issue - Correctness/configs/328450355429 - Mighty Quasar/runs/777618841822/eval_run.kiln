  "input": "I need to convert video.avi to WebM format using VP8 codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to WebM using the VP8 video codec with the realtime preset and constant bitrate (CBR) mode, use the libvpx encoder. Setting the preset to realtime (-deadline realtime) trades encoding quality for encoding speed, making it suitable for realtime or resource-constrained workflows. -b:v specifies a constant video bitrate (for example, 2000k for 2 Mbps), and -c:a libvorbis uses the widely supported Vorbis audio codec.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to maintain original resolution and aspect ratio.\n- Audio bitrate is set to 128k for good balance of quality and size.\n- Adjust the video bitrate (2000k) to suit your quality/size requirements.\n\nCommand breakdown:\n- -c:v libvpx selects VP8 video encoder.\n- -b:v 2000k sets constant video bitrate at 2 Mbps.\n- -deadline realtime activates the realtime preset for faster encoding.\n- -c:a libvorbis uses the Vorbis audio encoder.\n- -b:a 128k sets audio bitrate.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libvpx -b:v 2000k -deadline realtime -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.webm\n```\nConsider adjusting the video bitrate (-b:v) to match your quality needs or bandwidth constraints. Lowering the bitrate further increases encoding speed but reduces quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated by the model for converting to WebM format with the VP8 codec is accurate and corresponds to the user's request without any obvious mistakes in command generation.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. In the provided output, all options and parameters used are valid and correspond to the requirements for the task. For instance, the command includes valid codec options and proper bitrate specifications.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The model correctly specifies the input file, the codecs used, and the various options for bitrate and preset. All the parameters are consistent with the available options and syntax in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **pass** as it does not contain the issues mentioned either in the issue description or the failure example, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page."
