  "output": "To set specific bitrates of 10 Mbps for video and 1 Mbps for audio while maintaining compatibility for streaming, use constant bitrate mode for video (which is better for streaming than CRF) and encode the audio losslessly with a fixed bitrate.\n\n- **`-b:v 10000000`** sets the video bitrate to exactly 10,000,000 bits per second (10 Mbps).\n- **`-b:a 1000k`** sets the audio bitrate to 1,000 kbps with AAC encoding.\n- **`-maxrate`** and **`-bufsize`** are added to ensure smooth delivery by limiting bitrate variability (important for streaming).\n- Assumes you want to use the same codec/container as the example above (H.264/AAC in MP4). If your source has different dimensions/codec, this will still apply only the specified bitrate settings.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000000 -maxrate 10000000 -bufsize 20000000 -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the specific issue described in the issue description. The command generated seems correct for setting the specified video and audio bitrates. It uses appropriate options to match the user request without any syntax errors or invalid parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command constructed by the model is valid and does not include any nonexistent options or incorrect parameters. Therefore, it does not fail in the same way that the provided failure example does.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements dictated there. The parameters used (-b:v, -b:a, -maxrate, -bufsize) are acceptable and follow the right order in the command line syntax for ffmpeg.\n\n4) Since the model's output is valid, correctly matches the user requirements, and adheres to the ffmpeg documentation, it passes the evaluation without any issues.
