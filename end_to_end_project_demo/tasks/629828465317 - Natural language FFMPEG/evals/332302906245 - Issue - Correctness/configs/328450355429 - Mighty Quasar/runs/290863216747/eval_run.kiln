  "input": "I want to apply color correction and noise reduction in a filter chain. Please use -vf 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5' to adjust colors and reduce noise.",
  "output": "You're applying a filter chain for color correction and noise reduction using the -vf (video filter) option:\n\n- eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2 increases brightness by 0.1 and contrast by 1.2.\n- hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5 applies 3D denoising (spatial luma=4, chroma=3; temporal luma=6, chroma=4.5), which helps reduce noise.\n\nHereâ€™s how you combine these filters in an ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is input.mp4.\n- The output file is output.mp4.\n- Audio is simply copied; if you want audio processing as well, specify additional filters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly implements the specified filter chain for color correction and noise reduction, using proper ffmpeg syntax. Therefore, it passes this evaluation step.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model correctly employs the `-vf` flag for video filtering and uses valid filter parameters. Thus, it passes this evaluation step as well.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The `-vf` option is used correctly to specify a filter chain, and the filters used (`eq` for equalizer and `hqdn3d` for denoising) are valid options. The command does not contain any syntax errors and respects the expected order of options. It passes this evaluation step.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct and does not contain the issues described; it successfully generates a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
