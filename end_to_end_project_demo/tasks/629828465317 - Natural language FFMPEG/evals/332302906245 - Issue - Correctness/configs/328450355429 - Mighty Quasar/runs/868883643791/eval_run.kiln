  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine a specific video stream (0:2) and a specific audio stream (1:3) from your input file recording.mov into a single MP4, you can use ffmpeg’s -map option to select these streams explicitly. This approach copies (does not re-encode) the streams if they are compatible with MP4; otherwise, you may need to add encoding options. For maximum compatibility, it’s safest to re-encode both streams to common MP4 codecs (H.264 for video, AAC for audio).\n\n- -map 0:2 picks the video stream from the first input (recording.mov, which is input 0), stream index 2.\n- -map 1:3 picks the audio stream from the second input (could be the same file again, or a different one, here I assume you mean stream 1:3 within the same file; if not, clarify).\n- -c:v libx264 and -c:a aac ensure MP4 compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart for better streaming.\n\nAssuming all streams come from the same file (recording.mov), and you want to combine stream 0:2 (video) and stream 0:3 (audio), here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you truly meant audio from another file (e.g., stream 1:3 from a second input), you would specify both files:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -i otherfile.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace otherfile.mov with the actual file if different. Let me know if you need to handle any particular codecs or require further options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output provided by the model does not contain the issue. The ffmpeg command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the desired video and audio streams (0:2 for video and 0:3 for audio) from the same input file (`recording.mov`). The command also includes codec specifications for compatibility with the MP4 format and includes the `-movflags +faststart` to optimize for streaming. Thus, the command should work correctly as per the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The model's command does not contain any syntax errors or references to non-existent options, as is evident in the failing example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). The command generated by the model is valid and follows the expected ffmpeg command structure.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command follows the requirements set out in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, uses the `-map` option for stream selection, and specifies codecs that are compatible with the MP4 format. The command ordering is appropriate, as options that apply to specific input or output files correctly precede the filenames themselves. No errors or violations of the man page are present.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue. The command generated is appropriate for the user request and adheres to the usage rules as defined in the ffmpeg documentation. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
