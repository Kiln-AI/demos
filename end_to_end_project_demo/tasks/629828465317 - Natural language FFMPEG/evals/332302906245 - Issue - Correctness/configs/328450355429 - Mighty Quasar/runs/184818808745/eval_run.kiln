  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To quickly compress your large movie.mkv using ffmpeg's turbo preset, you should use the H.264 (libx264) encoder, which provides fast encoding with the turbo preset. Thispreset prioritizes speed over compression efficiency, resulting in a larger file than slower presets but significantly faster processing. A reasonable CRF value (such as 23) and AAC audio encoding are used for compatibility.\n\nExplanation of key parameters:\n- -c:v libx264 sets the video codec to H.264 (libx264).\n- -preset turbo uses the fastest encoding, sacrificing size/quality for speed.\n- -crf 23 sets quality (use a lower value for noticeably better quality; higher for smaller files).\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio to AAC at 128 kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart makes playback quicker in browsers.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures widest compatibility.\n\nThis command is optimized for speed and broad compatibility. Adjust the -crf value (18â€“28 range is common; lower = better) for your quality/size needs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p movie_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want an \".mp4\" output compatible with browsers and most media players.\n- The input has at least one video and one audio stream. If not, adjust accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command appears correct and aligns with the user's request to compress the file using the turbo preset while providing adequate explanation of the parameters used.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command produced does not contain a non-existent preset (like `extra_fast`), and the turbo preset is a valid option in ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters and structure used in the command are appropriate, and there are no syntax errors.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command should work as intended with valid ffmpeg options and parameters, so the evaluation should pass."
