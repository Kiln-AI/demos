    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model is correct in terms of syntax and functionality for stabilizing a shaky video using the `deshake` filter. It reflects the user's requirement accurately.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output, as the command generated is valid and uses the correct filter. The command does not contain any incorrect or non-existent options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct structure, applying the `-vf deshake` filter to the input file and specifying an output file name correctly.\n\n4) Therefore, given the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is valid and correctly fulfills the user's request to stabilize the shaky video using the `deshake` filter. The output would be considered a success."
