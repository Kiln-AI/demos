  "input": "I want to compress my large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset to reduce file size quickly.",
  "output": "To compress your large movie.mkv file using the turbo preset for faster encoding, we'll use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs, which are widely supported and offer a good balance between file size and quality. We'll also ensure the audio is encoded at a reasonable bitrate to maintain acceptable quality.\n\n* `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding.\n* `-preset turbo` enables the fastest preset available for H.264, prioritizing speed over compression efficiency.\n* `-crf 28` sets a relatively high compression level (lower is better; 23 is a good default, but increasing it to 28 will further reduce file size at the cost of some quality).\n* `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` encodes audio using AAC at 128 kbps, a reasonable bitrate for most needs.\n* `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older devices and browsers.\n\nAssumptions: This command assumes that the video is not already highly compressed and that a balance between quality and file size is acceptable. Also, it's assumed that the audio doesn't need to be lossless, as we're encoding it to AAC at 128 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v libx264 -preset turbo -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: Keep in mind that using the `turbo` preset will significantly reduce encoding time but at the cost of achieving the smallest possible file size and higher loss of quality compared to slower presets.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated appears to be valid and should work as intended for the task of compressing the provided video file `movie.mkv` using the turbo preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example> because it does not use a non-existent preset. The command correctly uses the `turbo` preset, which is valid for the H.264 codec.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct syntax, makes use of valid options, and respects the order of application for options associated with the input and output files.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does not contain the issue. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
