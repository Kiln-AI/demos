  "output": "To combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from your input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4, use the following command:\n\nThis command maps the video from stream 0:2 (-vcodec copy) and the audio from stream 1:3 (-acodec copy), effectively copying (not re-encoding) the streams without modifying the codec. The -map options are used to select the streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 1:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made: \n- Streams are correctly identified as stream 0:2 for video and stream 1:3 for audio. Be aware that if your file has different stream identifiers, you will need to adjust the map options. To identify streams in your input file, use `ffmpeg -i recording.mov`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated by the model appears to meet the requirements specified in the user message, which is to combine video and audio from the specified streams without error.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in <failure_example>. The command produced is structured correctly and does not utilize a non-existent option in FFmpeg, unlike `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`, which includes an incorrect preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The use of `-map` options is correct for selecting specific streams from the input file, and the use of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` appropriately indicates that the model intends to copy these streams without re-encoding, complying with the general rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output contains no issues. It correctly maps the video and audio streams, uses the appropriate copy codec for both, and adheres to the required command structure. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
