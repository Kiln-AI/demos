  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark `logo.png` to the bottom left corner of `input.avi`, use the `overlay` filter with the `alpha` option. The `overlay` filter places one video on top of another.  I'm assuming that `logo.png` has transparency. If it doesn't, you'll need to add an alpha channel to it first. I'm also going to add a 10 pixel padding from the left and bottom edges.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10:enable='between(t,0,1000)',format=auto,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.7\" output.avi\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   `-i input.avi -i logo.png`: Specifies the input video and the watermark image.\n*   `-filter_complex \"...\"`:  Indicates that we're using a complex filter graph.\n*   `overlay=x=10:y=H-h-10`: This is the core of the command.\n    *   `x=10`: Sets the horizontal position of the watermark 10 pixels from the left.\n    *   `y=H-h-10`: Positions the watermark 10 pixels from the bottom. `H` represents the height of the input video, and `h` represents the height of the logo.\n*   `enable='between(t,0,1000)'`: Makes the watermark only appear for the first 1000 seconds. Remove this if you want it on the whole video.\n*   `format=auto`: Automatically picks pixel format.\n*   `colorchannelmixer=aa=0.7`: Sets the alpha channel of the overlayed image to 0.7, making it 70% opaque (30% transparent).\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command adheres to the requirements specified by the user about adding a semi-transparent watermark image to the video.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced does not contain an invalid preset or syntax issue. It uses valid parameters and syntax for ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used in the command are valid, and the syntax follows ffmpeg's requirements regarding the ordering of input-output specification and filter application.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully generates a valid ffmpeg command for the user's request. Hence, it passes the evaluation."
