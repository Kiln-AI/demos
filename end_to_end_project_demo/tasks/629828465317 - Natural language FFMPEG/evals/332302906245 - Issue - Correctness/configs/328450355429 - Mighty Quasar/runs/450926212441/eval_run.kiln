  "output": " Assuming you have an input video named 'input_video.mp4', the following ffmpeg command will perform the required transformations:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf \"scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black,mblur=radius=3\" output_video.mp4\n```\n\nThis command accomplishes the following:\n\n- The input video is resized to 1080x1920 resolution using the scale filter.\n- The video is then centered on a black background using the pad filter, resulting in a new video with the original video in the center and enough black borders around it.\n- Finally, a motion blur with a radius of 3 is applied across the video using the mblur filter.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated correctly applies the filters requested by the user, including the scale, pad, and motion blur transformations using the specified parameters.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example given. The command provided by the model does not contain any syntax errors or unsupported options.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options used in the command (scale, pad, and mblur) are valid and correctly formatted.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it would pass the evaluation."
