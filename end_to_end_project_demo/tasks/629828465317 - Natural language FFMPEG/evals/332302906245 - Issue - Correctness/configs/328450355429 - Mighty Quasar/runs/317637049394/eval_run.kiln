  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine a specific video stream (0:2) and audio stream (1:3) into an MP4 container, we use `-map` to select the streams explicitly. We also use `-c copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is faster and lossless if the codecs are compatible with MP4.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly combines the specified video and audio streams from the input file using the `-map` option and copies them without re-encoding, which matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated does not include any invalid options or parameters that would cause a failure. In contrast, the failure example contains an incorrect preset that doesn't exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specific streams and `-c copy` to indicate that the streams should be copied as-is without re-encoding, which is allowed according to the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass."
