  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": " To rotate the video by 90 degrees clockwise and apply strong noise reduction, we can use the following ffmpeg command parameters:\n\n- `iw` specifies the input width, and `oh` specifies the output height. Since we want to rotate the video, the input height and output width need to be swapped in the rotated output.\n\n- `r` indicates that the source aspect ratio is maintained. When combined with the `-vf` (video filter) option for rotation, it tells ffmpeg to scale the video based on its original aspect ratio.\n\n- `rotate=90` is the filter to rotate the video.\n\n- For noise reduction, you would use the `noise` filter with the `reduce` and `median` options. The exact settings can vary, but `-noise_filter=median:d=7` is a starting point, where `d` is the noise suppression strength (higher values may yield more noticeable processing).\n\nWith these in mind, the command might look like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"transpose=2,transpose=1,rotate=90,noise=reduce=median:d=7\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\nNote: `-crf 23` and `-preset medium` keep the command suitable for streaming. Be aware that heavy noise reduction might result in a noticeable processing artifact depending on the aggressiveness of the settings (`d` value).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command generated doesn't effectively apply the appropriate filters for rotating the video and noise reduction. Specifically, the rotation filters are not correctly implemented since the \"transpose\" option handles 90-degree rotations without needing to apply multiple transpose filters, and the noise reduction filter usage seems incorrect.\n\n2) The model's output is indeed similar to the failure example, as it has an incorrect command structure and parameter usage. The use of `rotate=90` with `transpose` filters is nonsensical in this context, and the filter `noise=reduce=median:d=7` isn't a valid noise reduction filter in FFmpeg. This suggests confusion about how to properly apply noise reduction.\n\n3) The command breaks several requirements dictated in the man page. The `rotate=90` is incorrectly used; instead, `transpose=1` or `transpose=2` would suffice for rotating the video clockwise by 90 degrees. Additionally, the noise reduction filter appears to be incorrectly formulated and may not exist as described, violating the directive that FFmpeg commands must be correctly structured according to the documentation. \n\nTherefore, the model's output fails on all accounts: it does not meet the user requirements correctly, is similar to a failing output, and conflicts with the FFmpeg man page documentation."
