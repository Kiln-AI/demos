  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add a new subtitle track while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you can use the `-filter_complex` to delete existing subtitles and then map the new subtitle file. Assuming you have a subtitle file `subtitles.srt`:\n\n- `-i input.mp4` is your original video file.\n- `-i subtitles.srt` is your subtitles file.\n- The `-filter_complex \"[0:v][0:a]subtitles=subtitles.srt[vout]\"` is used when `subtitles.srt` is a subtitle file that can be burned in or added as a separate track (depending on context); for soft subtitles, this can be different.\n- To remove existing subtitle streams, we exclude them from mapping.\n- `-map 0:v` for the video stream.\n- `-map 0:a?` for audio streams if present.\n- For subtitles you add, use `-i` and map accordingly.\n\nHere's a method assuming you want to burn subtitles in and remove all existing subtitle tracks:\n\n**If you want to burn subtitles in:**\n\nThis approach burns the subtitles into the video stream, replacing all existing ones.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**If you want to add a subtitle stream as a soft subtitle and remove existing subtitle tracks:**\n\nUse `-scodec` to add subtitles and explicitly exclude existing subtitle streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a? -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s srt -map 1 -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng output.mp4\n```\n\nBut to *remove* all existing subtitles and *add* a new one (and assuming you want soft subtitles), you'd typically do:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a? -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s srt -disposition:s:0 default output.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:** if you want to remove all subtitle streams (no subtitles in the output) and add new subtitles as a separate track, you can just include only the streams you want. \n\nHere's a simpler command: remove subtitles and add new subtitles as a separate track:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a? -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s srt -metadata:s:s:0 language=eng output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- You're replacing all existing subtitle tracks.\n- You want to keep all video and audio streams.\n- You want to add your subtitles as a separate soft subtitle track.\n\nIf you want to *burn* the subtitles into the video (no separate subtitle track):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:** Burning in subtitles overlays them onto video, removing any existing subtitles.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** If your input files and subtitles are different, or if you want more specific behavior (soft/hard subtitles), please clarify.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, as it generates valid `ffmpeg` commands that match the user’s requirements (i.e., removing existing subtitle tracks and adding new subtitles). The commands, in both soft and hard subtitle contexts, align with what the user requested and appear to follow the correct syntax and functions of `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The commands generated are syntactically correct and utilize applicable `ffmpeg` options based on the context of the user request. There are no clearly invalid options like in the failure example.\n\n3) The commands generated by the model do not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. The options used, such as `-map`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, and the use of `-filter_complex` for subtitles are all aligned with what is supported by `ffmpeg`. There are no violation of expected syntaxes, and the flags/arguments used are correctly placed following the order prescribed by `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) Overall, the model did not generate an output that contained the issues described, and it successfully produced valid `ffmpeg` commands that correctly match the user’s request for adding subtitles while removing existing ones."
