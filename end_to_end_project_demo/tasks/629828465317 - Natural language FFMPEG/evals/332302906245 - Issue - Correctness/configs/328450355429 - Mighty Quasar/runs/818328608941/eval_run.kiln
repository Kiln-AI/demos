  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it simultaneously as an MP3 (320kbps) and a lossless WAV file, you can use `ffmpeg`'s powerful filter and multiple output capabilities in a single command.\n\n- `-vn` disables video recording in output.\n- The `-map a` directive maps all audio streams.\n- MP3 is encoded using `libmp3lame` at 320k bitrate.\n- WAV is output in its native PCM format (lossless).\n- Both files are produced in one pass, which is efficient for large files.\n\nHere's the command (replace `input.mp4` with your video file):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -map a -c:a:0 libmp3lame -b:a:0 320k -c:a:1 pcm_s16le output.mp3 output.wav\n```\n\nThis will extract the audio track(s) from `input.mp4` and save them as `output.mp3` (high-quality lossy) and `output.wav` (lossless) simultaneously. This approach saves time and I/O when working with large media files.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated seems correct for extracting audio from a video file and saving it as both an MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and a lossless WAV file.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command produced does not contain any incorrect options or non-existent presets. In fact, all used options are valid within the `ffmpeg` framework.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The order of the commands and options is correct, and it utilizes valid codecs (`libmp3lame` for MP3 and `pcm_s16le` for WAV), along with proper mapping of audio streams.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does indeed **pass** the criteria. The command generated is correct and meets the user's request without any issues."
