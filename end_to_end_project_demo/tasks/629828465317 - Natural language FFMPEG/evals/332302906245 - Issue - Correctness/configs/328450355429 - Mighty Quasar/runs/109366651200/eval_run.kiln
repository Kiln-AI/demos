  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from an MKV file and save them into an MP4 container, use the `-map` option.  `-map 0:4` selects the fifth stream (indexing starts at 0) from the first input file. Likewise for audio. Specifying copy for both audio and video streams tells ffmpeg to simply remux the streams into the new container without re-encoding. This makes the process very fast.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v copy -c:a copy trimmed.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly selects the specified video stream (0:4) and audio stream (0:9) from the input file `broadcast.mkv` and outputs them to `trimmed.mp4`, using the `-map` option and specifying `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` for remuxing without re-encoding. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The output command does not contain any invalid or incorrect parameters that would lead to a failure. The parameters used (like `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`) are valid according to the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` for selecting specific streams is correct, and the command follows the required syntax by specifying input options before the output file. Additionally, the usage of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` is valid for copying the streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the specified issue, so it should pass."
