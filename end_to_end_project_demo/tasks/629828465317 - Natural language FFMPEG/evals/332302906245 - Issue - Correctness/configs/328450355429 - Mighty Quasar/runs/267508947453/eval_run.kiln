  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you'll want to do two things:\n\n1. Disable all existing subtitle streams by using `-sn` (which means \"no subtitles\" and disables subtitle streams).\n2. Add the subtitles as a new subtitle stream or burn them into the video.\n\nIf you want to hardcode (burn in) subtitles from an external subtitle file (e.g., .srt), you can use the `subtitles` filter in `-vf`. This will embed the subtitles permanently into the video, removing any subtitle streams automatically.\n\nIf you want to add subtitles as a separate stream (soft subtitles) but still remove all other subtitle streams, you have to map the subtitle file as a new stream explicitly.\n\nAssuming you want to hardcode subtitles from `subs.srt` into your original video `input.mp4` and remove existing subtitles, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -sn -vf subtitles=subs.srt -c:a copy -c:v libx264 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-sn` disables all existing subtitle streams.\n- `-vf subtitles=subs.srt` burns the subtitles from `subs.srt` into the video.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio as-is.\n- `-c:v libx264` re-encodes the video to apply the subtitles.\n\nIf you want soft subtitles instead of hardcoding, let me know!",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step based on the specified criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output provides a valid `ffmpeg` command to add subtitles and remove existing ones while explaining the parameters used in the command. It effectively combines the required functionalities (burning in subtitles while disabling existing subtitle streams). Thus, it meets the requirements of the user without creating any issue with the command generated. \n\n**Conclusion:** The output does not contain the issue described, so it passes this evaluation step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe failing example is a command that generates an invalid preset. The model's output, however, correctly uses existing options and formats them validly. It does not demonstrate similar shortcomings as the failing example provided. \n\n**Conclusion:** The output is not similar to the failure example, so it passes this evaluation step.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nUpon reviewing the `ffmpeg` command output, it properly disables existing subtitle streams with `-sn`, uses the `-vf` parameter correctly to apply subtitles from an external file (which is valid as per the man page), and specifies the output format and codec accurately. The order of the options is appropriate, and there are no apparent conflicts with the requirements stated in the man page.\n\n**Conclusion:** The command does not break any requirements from the man page, so it passes this evaluation step.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not contain any issues. The command is valid, fulfills the user's request, and is constructed correctly based on the specifications from the man page. \n\n**Final Verdict:** The output passes all evaluation steps and does not contain any issues."
