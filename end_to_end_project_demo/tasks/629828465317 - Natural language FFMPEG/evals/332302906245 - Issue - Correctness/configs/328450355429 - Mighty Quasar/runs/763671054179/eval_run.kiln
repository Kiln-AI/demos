  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To overlay a watermark image (logo.png) at the bottom-left corner of your video and make it semi-transparent, you'll need to use the transparent overlay filters in ffmpeg. The key is to ensure the logo has an alpha channel, which enables transparency. Most PNG images have an alpha channel, so this will work directly. If your logo.png is not PNG and doesn't have alpha, you can convert it with png(logo.png) or add transparency using ffmpeg (see below). \n\nThe video scale and watermark position commands will place the logo at the bottom-left. Use the `overlay` filter to composite the logo with the alpha channel (rgba or argb colorspace) over the video.\n\nAssumption: \n--logo.png is an 8-bit (truecolor) or 32-bit (rgba) PNG with the desired alpha channel for transparency.\n- You want a basic semi-transparent watermark overlay.\n\nHere's a command to perform this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"overlay=shortest=1:x=10:y=trunc(h-'logo.png_h')-10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i logo.png` adds the watermark image.\n- `-filter_complex \"overlay=shortest=1:x=10:y=trunc(h-'logo.png_h')-10\"` overlays the logo at x=10, y=10 pixels from the bottom left corner:\n  - `x=10` and `y=trunc(h-'logo.png_h')-10` positions the logo at (10, bottom - logo height - 10) to keep it from the bottom.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the original audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `output.mp4` produces an MP4 video with a semi-transparent watermark in the bottom-left.\n\nIf your watermark is 100% transparent and you want a customized translucency (e.g., 50% opacity), you can add an alpha modification filter, but for simple semi-transparent overlay, the above is sufficient.\n\nIf your `logo.png` is not a truecolor or doesn't have an alpha channel, you can convert it or create transparency with:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i src.png -channel_layout rgba -c:v png -f image2 temp.png\n```\n\nThis should ensure the logo has a proper alpha channel. Then use the same `overlay` approach.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It successfully generates a command that meets the user's requirement of adding a semi-transparent watermark image to a video. The command is logically structured and adheres to the correct parameters for watermarks.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided does not contain a non-existent parameter (like `-preset extra_fast`), nor does it demonstrate any obvious syntax errors that would lead to it failing outright. The command employs valid filter options for FFmpeg.\n\n3) Reviewing the FFmpeg man page does not reveal any violations with respect to command requirements. The command follows the order of options and specifies inputs and outputs correctly. The syntax used for the `overlay` filter and positioning parameters is in line with FFmpeg standards. Furthermore, the command for copying audio is also valid.\n\n4) Considering all the evaluations above, the output does not contain the issue outlined in the issue description and shows correct functionality. Therefore, I conclude that the model's output passes the evaluation criteria."
