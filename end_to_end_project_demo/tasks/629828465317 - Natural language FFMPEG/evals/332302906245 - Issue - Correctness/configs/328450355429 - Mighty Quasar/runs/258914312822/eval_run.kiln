  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress `video.mov` using the x264 encoder's `hyper` preset for maximum encoding speed, the command uses H.264 video (libx264) with a default quality setting (`crf 23`) and AAC audio. The `hyper` preset prioritizes speed over compression efficiency, so the resulting file size may not be as small as with slower presets. The `yuv420p` pixel format ensures compatibility with a wide range of devices.\n\n### Assumptions:\n- The goal is to prioritize encoding speed (`hyper` preset).\n- Audio compression with AAC at 128 kbps is acceptable (no specific audio quality requested).\n- No resolution or aspect ratio changes are needed (original resolution retained).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe command produced by the model does not contain any issues related to the `ffmpeg` command generation as described in the issue description. It correctly utilizes the `libx264` codec with the `hyper` preset, includes audio encoding with AAC, and maintains the default quality setting with `crf 23`. Therefore, the output should pass this evaluation step.\n\n---\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n\nThe output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command specifies a valid preset (`hyper`) for speed-based processing. Given that `hyper` is a recognized encoding preset for the `libx264` codec, this output does not fail due to invalid preset usage.\n\n---\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nThe command adheres to the requirements set forth in the `ffmpeg` man page. The `-c:v libx264`, `-preset hyper`, and `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` parameters are all valid. The designation of pixel format with `-pix_fmt yuv420p` is also acceptable, ensuring wide compatibility.\n\n---\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the evaluation criteria. The command generated is valid, adheres to the ffmpeg syntax and options, and meets the user's request for compression using the specified preset. Thus, the output should pass evaluation overall."
