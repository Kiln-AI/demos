  "input": "I need to convert input.mov to AVI format using the libx263 video codec and mp3 audio",
  "output": "To convert a video to AVI format using the libx263 codec for video and MP3 for audio, you need to specify the video codec with `-c:v libx263` and the audio codec with `-c:a libmp3lame`. Note that `libx263` is a typo; you probably mean `libx263`, but the actual codec is `libx264` for H.264 encoding. Since you want the legacy H.263 codec, that's `h263` (a codec name in ffmpeg, but it doesn't have a lib prefix). \"libx263\" doesn't exist.\n\nAssuming you meant H.263 video codec (not libx264), we'll use `-c:v h263`. For audio, MP3 is encoded with `libmp3lame`.\n\nAVI container supports H.263 video and MP3 audio.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v h263 -c:a libmp3lame output.avi\n```\n\nIf you indeed wanted H.264 video, replace `h263` with `libx264`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue. The command it generated specifies `libx263` as the video codec, which does not exist. The model correctly identifies that this is likely a typo and suggests `h263` instead. However, providing an inaccurate codec in the command can lead to command failure, which goes against the requirement of generating a command that works correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, it is similar to the failure example provided. Just like in the failure example where an invalid preset is used, this output includes an invalid codec (`libx263`), which will cause the command to fail when executed.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command does break requirements as `libx263` is not a valid codec. The command generation should ensure correct codec names as provided in the FFmpeg documentation. Using an invalid codec effectively violates the requirement to correctly match the user's request with a functioning command.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does contain the issue, as it generates a command that incorporates a non-existent codec (`libx263`), which would not work. Therefore, it does not fully meet the user's request for an accurate and functional ffmpeg command."
