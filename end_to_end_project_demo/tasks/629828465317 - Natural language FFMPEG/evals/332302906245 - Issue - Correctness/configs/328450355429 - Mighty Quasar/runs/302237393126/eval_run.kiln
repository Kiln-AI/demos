  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode the subtitles into the video, use the `subtitles` filter in FFmpeg. For hardcoding, we use `draw_possibleutch=1` for font rendering.\n\n- `-vf subtitles=subtitles.srt` hardcoded subtitles from the srt file.\n- `drawtexts='fontsize=18:fontcolor=yellow'` dictates subtitle font and color settings to become yellow.\nWe then specify the input file, output file and our video and audio codec. \nWe assume `libx264` and `aac` (the video and audio H.264 and AAC) codec are acceptable.\n\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:draw_absolute.UTF8=1:draw_start=00:01:00,drawtexts='fontsize=18:fontcolor=white@1:shadowcolor=y yellow@1:shadowx=1:shadowy=2'\"  -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mkv\n```\nNote that you have to replace `output.mkv` with your actual output video filename \n\nAssumptions:\n1) H.264 (libx264) video codec and AAC audio codec are acceptable for output video file (are they the best match for your hardware and playback needs, or to suit your compatibility goals?)\n2).Constant Rate Factor(CRF) 18 offers reasonable image quality (default 23; using a lower value such as 18 or even a lower increases quality). If a lower value is used, output file size also grows. \n3) You are working on Linux or macOS.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The ffmpeg command generated is incorrect because:\n\n   - The filter syntax used with the `subtitles` filter is not valid. Specifically, the inclusion of `draw_absolute.UTF8=1:draw_start=00:01:00,drawtexts='...'` is incorrect. The `subtitles` filter does not accept parameters such as `drawtexts` in that context.\n   - The function `draw_possibleutch=1` mentioned is likely a typographical error as there is no such parameter in ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example provided. The command contains parameters that don't exist, which would cause the command to fail.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirements in the man page for ffmpeg. Specifically, it does not follow the correct usage of the `subtitles` filter and introduces parameters that do not map to the ffmpeg documentation on subtitle filtering. Additionally, the syntax errors like `'fontsize=18:fontcolor=white@1:shadowcolor=y yellow@1:shadowx=1:shadowy=2'` indicate misuse of how to set subtitle text properties within the `subtitles` filter.\n\nThus, the resulting command would not work correctly, as it fails to adhere to the correct parameters for ffmpeg's subtitle handling. Given these points, the model's output fails."
