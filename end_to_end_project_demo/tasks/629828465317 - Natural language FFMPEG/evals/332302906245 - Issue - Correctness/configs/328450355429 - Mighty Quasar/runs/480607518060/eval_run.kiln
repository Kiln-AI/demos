  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "It's not possible to create a single output file that contains both H.264 and H.265 encodings of the same video content. Container formats like MP4, MKV, etc. store only one version of each track (video/audio). Instead, you'll need to create separate files â€“ one encoded with H.264 and another with H.265.\n\nI'll show you the most efficient way to do this in a single FFmpeg command (generating both outputs simultaneously), which saves time by decoding the input only once and encoding both versions in one pass:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a? -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_h264.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a? -c:v libx265 -preset medium -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_h265.mp4\n```\n\n**Key points:**\n- This command creates two distinct output files (output_h264.mp4 and output_h265.mp4)\n- `-map 0:v -map 0:a?` maps all video and optional audio streams from input to each output\n- Uses different CRF values since H.265 typically achieves similar quality at ~65% the bitrate of H.264\n- H.264 uses CRF 23 (good default)\n- H.265 uses CRF 28 (slightly higher as it's more efficient)\n- Both use AAC audio encoding for compatibility\n\nIf you needed both codecs in a single file (which FFmpeg/Matroska can technically support), you'd be creating two separate video tracks rather than one video with multiple codecs - but this is generally not useful for most applications.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly identifies that it is not possible to create a single output file with both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously, noting that typical container formats only support a single version of each track. This understanding aligns with the requirements laid out in the user input. The model then provides a valid command that generates two output files, one for each codec, while preserving the video and audio streams. Therefore, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue_description.\n\n2) The command generated in the model's output does not resemble the failing output example provided. The output command is well-formed and correctly structured; it utilizes proper options and mappings in a clear manner consistent with how ffmpeg commands are constructed. The command is valid according to the FFmpeg syntax and performs the desired action efficiently. Hence, the output is not similar to the cited failure example.\n\n3) The command presented by the model adheres to the requirements in the FFmpeg man page, correctly implementing the options for mapping video and audio streams and codec specifications. The `-map` options for representing inputs to outputs are correctly applied, and it respects the fact that different codec options are required for different outputs. No requirements laid out in the man page are broken, and it effectively follows the order of parameters as specified.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output successfully addresses the user's request without errors and adheres to FFmpeg command structure requirements. Thus, it passes in all criteria."
