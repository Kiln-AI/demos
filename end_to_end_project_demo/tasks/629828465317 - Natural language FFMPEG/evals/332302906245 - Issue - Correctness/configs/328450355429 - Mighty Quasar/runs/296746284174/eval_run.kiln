No re-encoding is needed here, so you can simply copy the streams for maximum quality and speed.\n\n- -map 0:2 selects video stream 2 from input file 0.\n- -map 0:3 selects audio stream 3 from input file 0.\n- -c copy copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- output.mp4 is the MP4 container with only the selected streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes your input file `recording.mov` has at least four streams, and the streams 2 and 3 are video and audio, respectively. If any stream types are different (e.g. subtitle, data), you may need to adjust accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option to select the appropriate video and audio streams from the input file. It also uses the `-c copy` option to ensure that the streams are copied without re-encoding, which is appropriate given the user's request to combine specific streams into an MP4 file. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated is syntactically correct and references valid streams (0:2 for video and 0:3 for audio as specified by the user). Since the output command does not contain any nonexistent options or incorrect flags, it cannot be classified as a failure.\n\n3) The command in the output does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax for mapping input streams to output streams, and the use of `-c copy` is allowed as it indicates that the codecs of the selected streams are to be copied rather than re-encoded. The command structure aligns with ffmpeg's expected input-output mapping requirements.\n\nOverall, the model's output is correct and effectively meets the user's request, handling the input and generating a correct ffmpeg command. The evaluation concludes that the model performed well and did not encounter any issues."
