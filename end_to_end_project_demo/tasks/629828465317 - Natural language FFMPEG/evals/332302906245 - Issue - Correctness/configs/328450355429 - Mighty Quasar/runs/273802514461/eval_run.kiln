  "output": "To map the third video stream and the second audio stream from `multi.avi` into `final.mp4`, we'll use the `ffmpeg` `-map` option to select the desired streams.\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (index 2) from the first input file (index 0).\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (index 1) from the first input file (index 0).\n\nThe command will combine these selected streams into the output file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on your given criteria.\n\n1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated correctly reflects the user's requirements: mapping the specified streams from `multi.avi` into `final.mp4`. It uses the `-map` options correctly without any syntax errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is valid—there is no unsupported parameter or syntax (such as an incorrect preset)—and it accurately reflects the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the given ffmpeg man page. The use of the `-map` option is correctly employed to specify the selection of streams based on their indices from the input file, and the output file name is provided without errors. It follows the general usage rules as specified in the man page.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output does not contain any issues, it successfully adheres to user requirements, does not resemble the provided failure example, and adheres to the ffmpeg man page guidelines. Thus, it should pass the evaluation successfully."
