  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": " To map the third audio stream to the output while keeping the original video track, you can use the `anullsrc` filter to create a dummy audio track and merge the desired audio streams using filter_complex.\n\nAssuming you want to maintain the source video resolution and codecs, it would be best to inspect the source video to determine these settings. FFmpeg typically uses the first video stream's settings as a default unless specified otherwise. So, we'll use those settings. Here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:0 -map 0:3+ -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nHere, `-map 0:0` instructs FFmpeg to map the first video stream (`0:0`). `-map 0:3+` tells FFmpeg to map the third audio stream along with any associated video tracks. We're copying video and audio codecs without re-encoding using `-c:v copy` and `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` to encode the audio stream using AAC at 128kbps. Finally, `output.mp4` is the name of the output file.\n\nExplanation of the command:\n\n- `-i input.mkv`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:0`: Maps the first video stream of the file.\n- `-map 0:3+`: Maps the third audio stream (plus any associated video streams) of the file.\n- `-c:v copy`: Instructs FFmpeg not to re-encode the video stream (using the codec and settings copied from input).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encodes the audio stream using AAC at 128kbps, replacing the audio.\n- `-b:a 128k`: Sets the bitrate for the audio stream to 128kbps. Adjust accordingly to your needs and given that we encoded new audio, we're specifying this value, but it's worth noting it is optional when re-encoding to a common format like AAC.\n- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file name.\n\nRemember, this assumes the use of AAC for audio and it keeps the video stream unchanged. If the video tracks have specific requirements (like asphalt codecs, chroma subsampling methods, etc.), you would need to inspect and mimic those settings in the command as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step according to the guidelines provided.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output command generated by the model appears to contain a significant issue related to the `-map` options. The command `-map 0:3+` is incorrect; the `+` at the end of the map specification is not valid syntax in this context. Instead, it should simply be `-map 0:3` to correctly map the third audio stream without attempting to add additional mappings as indicated by the `+`. Therefore, this command will likely fail to execute as intended and does not meet the user's requirement correctly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   - The output generated by the model does not exactly match the structure of the provided failing output example. The failure example specifically mentions an invalid preset option, while this output contains an incorrect mapping syntax. Thus, although the mistake is critical, it does not match the exact nature of the failure example regarding the use of options; it fails in a different manner.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Yes, the command violates requirements from the man page due to the incorrect usage of the mapping option. The `-map` option syntax must comply with FFmpeg's standards, and the use of `+` is not valid in this context. As such, the command generated would not execute correctly based on the documentation provided in the man page.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does contain the issue described, as the command will not work due to the incorrect mapping syntax (`-map 0:3+`). Thus, it fails according to the guideline.\n\n**Final Assessment: The model's output contains the issue described in the first step. The command will not execute properly due to the misuse of the `-map` option, which would lead to a failure in fulfilling the user's request. Therefore, the evaluation concludes that the model's output is flawed.**"
