  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream, you want to copy the video track directly and discard the audio stream. The `-c:v copy` tells ffmpeg to stream copy (without re-encoding) the video, and omitting audio input and audio copy options will exclude the audio altogether. This approach is very efficient and preserves the original video quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output_video_only.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video_only.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream as-is without re-encoding.\n- `-an` disables all audio (no audio output).\n- `output_video_only.mp4` is the output file without audio.\n\nThis command will produce a file with the same video quality and codec as the input, just without any audio tracks.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output_video_only.mp4`) correctly removes the audio without re-compressing the video stream, meeting the user's requirement. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. It does not contain any incorrect or invalid parameters, and it produces a valid command that effectively meets the user's specifications.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used in the command (`-c:v copy` for copying the video stream and `-an` for disabling audio) are valid and correctly applied according to the guidelines.\n\n4) Since the command is valid, fulfills the userâ€™s request, and follows the ffmpeg documentation, it should be classified as passing rather than failing."
