  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "You can chain multiple video filters in ffmpeg using the `-vf` option by separating each filter with a comma. For stabilization, there are the `vidstabdetect` and `vidstabtransform` filters (from the vid.stab plugin), but typically stabilization is done in two passes: first detect then transform. However, if you already have the transform vectors, then you can apply the stabilization with `vidstabtransform`.\n\nColor grading can be done with various filters like `eq` (for brightness, contrast, saturation), `colorbalance`, or even LUTs depending on your needs. For a simple color grading example, I'll demonstrate a custom balance of brightness and contrast using `eq`.\n\nRotation and scaling can be done with the `rotate` and `scale` filters respectively, but it's often simpler to use a combined `transform` such as the `rotate` filter and `scale` filter chained appropriately.\n\nHere’s the approach assuming you have already generated stabilization transform data and want to apply it, then do color grading and geometric transform:\n\n- Apply stabilization with `vidstabtransform`.\n- Apply color grading with `eq` (e.g., adjust brightness, contrast, saturation).\n- Apply rotate and scale using `rotate` and `scale`.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf,eq=contrast=1.2:brightness=0.05:saturation=1.3,rotate=PI/6:ow=rotw(iw,ih)/2:oh=roth(iw,ih)/2,scale=1280:720\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `vidstabtransform=smoothing=30:input=transforms.trf`: applies stabilization using previously detected transforms stored in `transforms.trf`.\n- `eq=contrast=1.2:brightness=0.05:saturation=1.3`: increases contrast, slightly brightens, and boosts saturation for color grading.\n- `rotate=PI/6:ow=rotw(iw,ih)/2:oh=roth(iw,ih)/2`: rotates video by 30 degrees (PI/6 radians), sets output width/height to rotated dimensions halved to center the rotation.\n- `scale=1280:720`: scales final output to 1280x720.\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18`: good quality H.264 encoding.\n- `-c:a copy`: copies original audio as-is.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You have already run `vidstabdetect` on the input and have an associated `transforms.trf` file.\n- You want a 30-degree rotation (adjust `PI/6` to your desired angle).\n- Final output scaled to 720p.\n- You want basic manual color grading; for complex grading, a LUT or more complex filters might be preferred.\n\nIf you have no stabilization vectors yet, the process would be two-pass, but the question was about chaining for transformations.",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance, let's examine the output based on the criteria set forth:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The output successfully generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that chains several filters including stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations. The command structure appears correctly composed according to `ffmpeg` syntax and does not contain any apparent issues relating to the generation of a command which may fail. Therefore, the output does not contain the described issue, as it generates a valid command fulfilling the user’s requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The output provided generates a valid command with established options and parameters. The command does not feature incorrect presets or values that lead to failure like the example of `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist. Instead, it utilizes valid options allowable under `ffmpeg`. Therefore, it is not similar to the example of a failing output.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements as laid out in the `ffmpeg` man page. Each option and filter used is valid, and the structure of the command (regarding input and output file specifications) is correctly formatted. There are no violations of option ordering, and all parameters used are recognized by `ffmpeg`. Hence, the command passes this check.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issues described, thereby passing. The command generated is valid according to `ffmpeg` syntax, matches user requirements, and maintains compliance with the `ffmpeg` man page directives.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is deemed successful, as it correctly constructs a valid `ffmpeg` command addressing the user's needs without deviations or errors."
