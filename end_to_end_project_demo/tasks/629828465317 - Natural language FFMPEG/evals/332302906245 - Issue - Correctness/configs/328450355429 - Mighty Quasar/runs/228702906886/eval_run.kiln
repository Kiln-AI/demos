  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC while applying noise reduction, follow these steps:\n\n1. Extract the audio stream and encode it to FLAC using the experimental codec option (FLAC is well-supported by ffmpeg, but specifying -strict experimental allows codecs flagged as experimental to be used).\n2. Apply noise reduction using the afftdn audio filter, which is built-in to ffmpeg for basic noise reduction.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to target a moderate level of noise reduction suitable for general audio cleanup.\n- The output file will be called output.flac.\n- If you need stronger/more specialized noise reduction, consider preprocessing with dedicated audio tools (e.g. Audacity, SoX).\n\nHereâ€™s the best practice command:\n\n- -vn disables video processing (extract audio only).\n- -c:a flac encodes audio as FLAC.\n- -af afftdn applies frequency domain noise reduction; adjusting nt=w (noise threshold width) tunes aggressiveness.\n- -strict experimental allows experimental codecs (needed for some ffmpeg builds and codec versions, though FLAC is usually stable).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -af afftdn=nf=-25 -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\n- afftdn=nf=-25 applies moderate noise reduction (lower values like -15 are less aggressive; more negative is stronger).\n- Adjust nf parameter as needed for your source material.\n\nThis command extracts the audio, applies noise reduction, and encodes it to FLAC using ffmpeg's built-in capabilities.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does *not* contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command seems appropriate for extracting audio from a video file and converting it to FLAC format while applying noise reduction. There are no apparent mistakes in the command's syntax or logic.\n\n2) The output generated by the model is *not* similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command produced by the model does not contain any incorrect parameters (like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`), and all options appear valid. The command structure aligns with the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (-vn to disable video processing, -c:a flac to set the audio codec, -af afftdn for audio filtering, and -strict experimental for using experimental codecs) are correctly used and follow the guidelines for command structure. The assumptions made about the usage of the options are valid and align with standard ffmpeg practices.\n\n4) Since the generated command is syntactically and logically sound, it does *not* contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
