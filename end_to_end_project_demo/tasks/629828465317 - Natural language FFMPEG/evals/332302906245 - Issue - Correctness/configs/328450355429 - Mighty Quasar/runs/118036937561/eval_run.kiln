  "input": "Help me create a complex filter that resizes, adds border, and applies motion blur. Use -vf 'scale=1920:1080,pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black;mblur=radius=3' for the transformations.",
  "output": "Your provided filter chain mostly covers resizing, adding a border (via padding), and applying motion blur. Let me break down each component and correct/improve as needed:\n\n- scale=1920:1080 resizes the video to 1920x1080.\n- pad=1920:1080:0:0:color=black adds padding to ensure the video is 1920x1080, with a black border if needed (in this example, since size matches, no actual border is added; to see a border, pad size should be larger than scaled size).\n- mblur=radius=3 attempts motion blur, but the correct filter is `tblend`/`minterpolate`/`smartblur`, as there is no built-in `mblur` filter in FFmpeg by default.\n\nHere’s a best practice example to resize, add a 10px black border, and apply a motion blur using the `tblend` filter, which simulates motion blur by blending adjacent frames:\n\n- First, resize to 1900x1080 (so padding can add up to 1920x1080).\n- Pad to 1920x1080 (adds a 10px border on left/right).\n- Use `tblend` with `all_mode='average'` and `repeatlast=0` for basic motion blur.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"\n  scale=1900:1080,\n  pad=1920:1080:10:0:color=black,\n  tblend=all_mode=average,framestep=2\n\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n- scale=1900:1080 → shrinks video so border can be added.\n- pad=1920:1080:10:0:color=black → adds a 10px black border on the left (and implicitly right, as total width is 20px larger).\n- tblend=all_mode=average → blends consecutive frames for a motion blur effect.\n- framestep=2 → helps control the strength of the blur (you can experiment with this).\n\n**Assumption:** You want a visible border and a workable motion blur with standard FFmpeg filters. If another motion blur technique is preferred, let me know!\n\n**For more advanced blur (using multiple steps):**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"\n  scale=1900:1080,\n  pad=1920:1080:10:0:color=black,\n  tblend=all_mode=average,framestep=2,\n  tblend=all_mode=average,framestep=2\n\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis double `tblend` increases blur strength.\n\n**Summary:** Use `scale`, `pad` for border, and `tblend` for motion blur — as there’s no native `mblur` filter in FFmpeg.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. While it correctly explains the techniques and parameters used in the command, it incorrectly identifies the motion blur filter as `mblur`, which does not exist in FFmpeg. The model should have provided a command that uses a valid motion blur filter instead of suggesting non-existent filters.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output doesn't directly resemble the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model includes valid options (scale, pad), but has an incorrect motion blur filter name instead of an entirely incorrect preset like `extra_fast`.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, the command breaks requirements dictated in the man page by using an incorrect filter name (`mblur`). The filter named `mblur` does not exist, which means the command would fail.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains the issue described, as it suggests a non-existent filter in the FFmpeg command, leading to a command that would not execute successfully. Therefore, it should fail in this evaluation."
