  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from a video file without re-encoding the video stream, you can use the `-c:v copy` parameter to copy the video stream directly, and `-an` to disable audio recording. This keeps the video stream intact and results in a fast process without quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output_no_audio.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue_description. The FFmpeg command generated correctly removes the audio from the video without re-compressing the video stream, which aligns perfectly with the user's requirement.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure_example. The command produced is valid and uses recognized parameters (-c:v copy and -an) that correctly accomplish the task of removing audio from the video without re-encoding.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. Specifically, the use of `-c:v copy` instructs FFmpeg to copy the video stream unchanged, and `-an` correctly disables audio recording. Both options are valid as per the documentation.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, fully meets the user's request, and adheres to the FFmpeg command specifications. Therefore, it should pass."
