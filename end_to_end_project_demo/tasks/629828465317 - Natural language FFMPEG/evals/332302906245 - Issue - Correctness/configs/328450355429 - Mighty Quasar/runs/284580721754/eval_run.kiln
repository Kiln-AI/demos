  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as a high-quality MP3, you can use `ffmpeg` to map the audio stream, encode it with the `libmp3lame` codec, and set a high bitrate (like 320 kbps) for maximum quality.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -q:a 0 -map a -codec:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i video.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-map a` selects all audio streams from the input.\n- `-codec:a libmp3lame` uses the LAME MP3 encoder.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (maximum for MP3).\n- `-q:a 0` sets the highest audio quality in variable bitrate mode (optional but common).\n- `output.mp3` is the output file name.\n\nAssumption: The video file contains audio streams compatible with extraction and encoding to MP3.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain an issue as it successfully generates an appropriate `ffmpeg` command that matches the requirements of extracting audio from the video file and saving it as a high-quality MP3 file. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced is correctly structured and utilizes valid parameters without any errors (unlike the provided example of a command with a non-existent preset).\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements specified in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It properly specifies the input file, selects the audio stream, sets the audio codec correctly, and defines the audio bitrate. There is no violation of the command structure or option usage as described in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output **does not** contain the issue described; it successfully provides a valid and functional `ffmpeg` command tailored to the user's request. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
