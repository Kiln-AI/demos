  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To select specific streams—here, the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream—you can use ffmpeg's `-map` option. Stream indexing in ffmpeg starts from 0, so the 7th video stream is number 6, and the 14th audio stream is number 13.\n\n- Use `-map 0:v:6` to specify the 7th video stream.\n- Use `-map 0:a:13` for the 14th audio stream.\n- Keep in mind that if your input has multiple streams, this explicitly picks those streams from the first input (`0`), which is assumed here.\n\nAssuming no additional encoding parameters are needed, the command would look like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis command copies the selected streams without re-encoding; if you want to encode or process them differently, additional parameters would be needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain a fundamental issue as described in the issue description. The generated command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams and uses the `-c copy` option, which allows for the streams to be copied without re-encoding, matching the user's request.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model does not utilize any incorrect or non-existent options (like `-preset extra_fast`), so it doesn't exhibit a failing output pattern.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax used is correct, and the options specified (e.g., file input, stream mapping, and codec copying) are properly applied in accordance with the ffmpeg command-line requirements.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain any issues. It accurately represents a valid ffmpeg command for mapping video and audio streams without re-encoding, which aligns well with the user requirements. Overall, the performance of the model on this task should be marked as successful, as the generated command meets the user’s needs and adheres to the specifications of ffmpeg's functionality."
