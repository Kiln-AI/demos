  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using ffmpeg's `deshake` filter, the filter analyzes adjacent frames and compensates for camera shake by shifting them appropriately. This filter works best with moderate shakes and won't fully stabilize extremely shaky footage or handle rotation.\n\nHereâ€™s a basic command applying the `deshake` filter:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake\" -c:a copy stabilized_ride.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf \"deshake\"` applies the deshake filter to the video.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio as is without re-encoding.\n- The output file is named `stabilized_ride.mp4`.\n\nIf the shake is severe, you could customize `deshake` parameters (like `x`, `y`, `w`, `h`, `rx`, `ry`, `edge`, etc.) but the above command is a good starting point.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues related to the command generation. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake\" -c:a copy stabilized_ride.mp4`) is a valid command for stabilizing a video using the `deshake` filter and adheres to the requirements specified in the user input.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated uses valid parameters and does not include any incorrect or nonexistent options.\n\n3) The command conforms to the requirements dictated in the man page. The order of options and the use of the `deshake` filter is appropriate, and it does not violate any syntax rules or guidelines provided in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command appears valid, matches the user requirements, and does not fail based on the specified criteria. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
