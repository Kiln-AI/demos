  "output": "To remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream, use the `-c:v copy` option to copy the video stream directly without re-encoding. To exclude the audio, use the `-an` option which selects all audio streams for disable (i.e., \"a\"udio and \"n\"o audio selected).\n\nAssuming there's only one video stream in the input file (which is typical).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -c:v copy -an output.mp4\n```\nThis command creates a new MP4 file `output.mp4` with the same video as the input, but without any audio streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided correctly matches the user requirement of removing audio from the video without re-compressing the video stream. It uses the `-c:v copy` option to copy the video stream and the `-an` option to disable audio, adhering to the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is appropriate and should work correctly for the task at hand.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (`-i`, `-c:v copy`, and `-an`) are all valid and serve the intended purpose of the command.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully delivers a functional ffmpeg command that aligns with user instructions, adhering to syntax and feature requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
