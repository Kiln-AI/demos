  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "The `libx264` encoder (H.264) has no preset literally named “maximum_efficiency”, so I’m mapping it to the preset that delivers the highest compression ratio at the cost of encoding speed: **`veryslow`** (or the even more thorough `placebo`, although the additional savings over `veryslow` are marginal and the time increase is dramatic).\n\n- Profile (`-profile:v high`) and pixel format (`yuv420p`) are left as defaults (≈ baseline web HD), because you didn’t specify otherwise.  \n- Audio is being copied (-c:a copy), because re-encoding audio at an already-low bitrate usually isn’t worth the CPU time/storage trade-off.  \n- CRF 23 (the usual default) is kept; lower it if the quality isn’t acceptable.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 23 -c:a copy compressed_video.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It correctly identifies that there is no preset named \"maximum_efficiency\" and substitutes it with the closest valid preset that offers high compression efficiency, which is \"veryslow\". The command generated is valid and should function as intended as per the requirements stated by the user.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The generated command does not use an invalid preset (like \"extra_fast\") but instead provides a plausible alternative.\n\n3) According to the man page, the command generated by the model follows the required syntax and usage for `ffmpeg`. The options used (-i, -c:v, -preset, -crf, and -c:a) are all valid, and the command is structured correctly.\n\n4) Given the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is syntactically and semantically correct, and since the specified preset is not valid, the model appropriately substituted it for \"veryslow\". \n\nOverall, the output is appropriate, matches the user's request, and does not interfere with any requirements from the FFmpeg man page. The output should pass the evaluation."
