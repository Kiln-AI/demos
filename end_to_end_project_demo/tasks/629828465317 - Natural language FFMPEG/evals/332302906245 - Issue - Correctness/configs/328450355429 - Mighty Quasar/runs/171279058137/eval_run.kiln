  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To convert your video to use a constant bitrate (not variable bitrate) of 50,000 kbps (50 megabits/s) and make it web-ready, you should use the H.264 codec and set the audio to AAC. Also, include the -movflags +faststart option for improved streaming and -pix_fmt yuv420p for maximum compatibility.\n\n- -c:v libx264 sets the video codec to H.264, which is widely supported for web playback.\n- -b:v 50000k sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps.\n- -maxrate and -bufsize should usually be included with CBR for true constant bitrate, but are not required for most web playback—this example keeps it simple.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio in AAC at 128 kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart helps browsers start playback before the entire file is downloaded.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures broad compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output_50Mbps.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file is input.mp4; change as needed.\n- Default frame rate and resolution are retained—adjust if you wish to enforce a specific quality or size.\n- This command uses constant bitrate; if you truly want to enforce CBR for streaming, you can add -maxrate 50000k -bufsize 100000k as well.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is valid and accurately matches the user's requests for a video stream with a specified bitrate of 50000k and web readiness. The explanation provides a clear understanding of the parameters used, and they adhere to FFmpeg's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does not contain any nonexistent parameters or incorrect syntax. The command is formatted correctly and uses valid options according to the FFmpeg man page.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly implements the syntax for FFmpeg options. However, while the recommendation to use -maxrate and -bufsize could be considered a best practice for ensuring constant bitrate (CBR), the command itself remains valid without them for general use.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly follows the user's requirements and adheres to the guidelines outlined in the FFmpeg man page. Therefore, it should be considered a pass."
