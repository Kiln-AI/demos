  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, use ffmpeg's `vstack` filter. Both videos should be the same width and have matching properties (such as frame rate). If the inputs differ in these attributes, you may need to scale or adjust them beforehand; this command assumes they’re compatible.\n\n- The `-filter_complex` option allows use of advanced filtering (here, `[0][1]vstack=inputs=2` takes streams from both inputs and stacks them vertically).\n- The input order matters: first input (`top_video.mp4`) is on top, second input (`bottom_video.mp4`) is on the bottom.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0][1]vstack=inputs=2\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a copy stacked.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Videos match in width and frame rate.\n- Audio is copied from the first video (or discarded if none; modify as needed).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0][1]vstack=inputs=2\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset fast -c:a copy stacked.mp4`) correctly uses the `vstack` filter to stack the videos vertically. Additionally, it does not misuse any options or parameters, aligning with the requirements of the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated uses correct syntax and options available in the FFmpeg documentation. There are no invalid options or parameters that would cause the command to fail.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses `-filter_complex` with `vstack`, specifies compatible input and output files, and provides parameters for encoding that are valid (`-c:v libx264`, `-crf 23`, `-preset fast`, and `-c:a copy`). All options used in the command are appropriate according to the requirements and context.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. لذا، ينبغي أن ينجح."
