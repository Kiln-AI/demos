  "input": "Convert my MOV file to WebM format using the libx264 codec for online video",
  "output": "To convert a MOV file to WebM format for online video, you should use the VP8 or VP9 codec as WebM does not support H.264 (libx264). For best browser compatibility, use VP8 (libvpx), which works in all modern browsers. The audio codec should be Vorbis (libvorbis).\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your input file is named input.MOV.\n- You want reasonable quality and browser compatibility.\n- Output should be called output.webm.\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v libvpx uses the VP8 codec for video.\n- -b:v 1M sets the video bitrate to 1 Mbps, adjustable for quality/size tradeoff.\n- -c:a libvorbis uses Vorbis for audio, compatible with WebM.\n- -b:a 128k sets audio bitrate.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.MOV -c:v libvpx -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis -b:a 128k output.webm\n```\n\nIf you want better compression at the cost of compatibility (VP9), you can use libvpx-vp9 instead of libvpx.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue, as it incorrectly suggests using the `libx264` codec for converting a MOV file to WebM format. WebM format does not support H.264 codec (libx264); it uniquely supports VP8 and VP9 codecs. Therefore, the command is incorrect and would not work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The failing example mentioned an invalid preset name (`extra_fast`), while the model's output correctly follows the syntax of ffmpeg commands but simply suggests the use of an unsupported codec for the specified format.\n\n3) The command in the model's output does violate the requirements as outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Specifically, it uses a codec (libx264) that is not supported for the WebM format. According to the man page, each format has specific codecs that are required for encoding, and using libx264 with WebM is not compliant with its specifications.\n\n4) Given the above analysis, the model's output contains the issue described and thus should fail the evaluation."
