    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses the `-c copy` option, which indicates that we are copying the streams without re-encoding. This is not an error and matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in the failure example. The command produced is valid and does not include any incorrect options or non-existent parameters. It follows the correct syntax and logic for the intended operation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options used are appropriately structured, respecting the input and output specifications for stream mapping and copy commands.\n\n4) Because the model's output retains proper command structure and functionality according to FFmpeg documentation, it passes the evaluation without issue. It successfully fulfills the user's request and correctly applies the requirements for the specified input and output."
