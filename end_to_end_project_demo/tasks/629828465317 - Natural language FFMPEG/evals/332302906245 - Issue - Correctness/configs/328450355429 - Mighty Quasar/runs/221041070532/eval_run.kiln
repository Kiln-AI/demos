    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command correctly maps the 7th video stream (`-map 0:v:7`) and the 14th audio stream (`-map 0:a:14`) from the input file `input.mov`, which aligns with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not contain any erroneous presets or options that would invalidate it, unlike the failing example which contained an invalid preset name.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` option is correctly used to specify the desired streams from the input, and the command follows the expected syntax of `ffmpeg` commands.\n\n4) Since the model correctly generated the `ffmpeg` command without any issues, it **passes** the evaluation."
