  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple video filters in a specific order, you can chain them using the `-vf` parameter with filters separated by commas. The order in which you list the filters is the order in which they will be applied.\n\nFor temporal noise reduction, a common filter is `hqdn3d`. For spatial denoising, `nlmeans` from `frei0r` or `nlmeans` filter in `ffmpeg` can be used (availability depends on your ffmpeg build). For edge enhancement, `unsharp` is commonly used.\n\nAssuming you want to apply:\n\n1. Temporal noise reduction (`hqdn3d`)\n2. Spatial denoising (`nlmeans`)\n3. Edge enhancement (`unsharp`)\n\nin that sequence, the filter chain syntax would look like this:\n\n```bash\n-vf \"hqdn3d, nlmeans, unsharp\"\n```\n\nMake sure you have the necessary `ffmpeg` build with `frei0r` or relevant filters enabled for `nlmeans`.\n\nHere's an example command applying these filters to an input video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d, nlmeans, unsharp\" output.mp4\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you need specific parameters for each filter, you can specify them accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated seems to be well-formed and follows the user request properly by using the correct filter syntax with filters separated by commas. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is composed of valid filter names and uses the correct syntax for chaining the filters, whereas the failure example provided a command with an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly applies the filters with the `-vf` option and specifies a valid input and output file format.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, so it passes."
