  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "To achieve maximum compatibility across various devices, we'll use the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec, both of which are widely supported. We'll also ensure the pixel format is yuv420p, which is compatible with most devices. Additionally, we'll set a moderate bitrate to balance quality and file size.\n\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding, a universally supported codec.\n- profile:v baseline and level:v 3.0 are set to ensure compatibility with older devices.\n- pix_fmt yuv420p maintains compatibility with a broad range of devices.\n- c:a aac is a widely supported audio codec.\n- b:v 512k and b:a 128k set moderate bitrates for video and audio, respectively, to balance quality and compatibility.\n- -movflags +faststart is used for fast streaming.\n\nAssuming the input file is \"input.mp4\" and the desired output file is \"output.mp4\", the command is:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level:v 3.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:v 512k -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: This command prioritizes compatibility over quality. If you need higher video quality, consider adjusting the bitrate settings or using a slower preset for better compression efficiency.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command produced is coherent and adheres to the general usage of `ffmpeg`, with correct syntax and valid options. The codecs and parameters chosen are appropriate for maximizing compatibility with devices.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the failing example. The command provided is valid and does not include any incorrect options, such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to the requirements stated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The order of options is appropriate, and all specified options are valid for both the input and output files. Additionally, the codecs and parameters used align with the documentation provided for compatibility.\n\n4) **Conclusion**\nThe model's output does not exhibit the issues stated in the evaluation criteria. The command is complete, valid, and matches the user's requirements for universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings. The output should be considered successful."
