  "input": "Extract frames from video.mp4 every 5 seconds and save as PNG images using the lossless preset",
  "output": "To extract frames every 5 seconds as lossless PNG files, use the fps filter to select frames at 0.2 fps (1 frame every 5 seconds) and the lossless PNG codec (`-c:v png`). The images will be auto-numbered and saved as frame-000001.png, frame-000002.png, etc.\n\n- `fps=0.2` tells the filter to keep one frame every 5 seconds (0.2 frames per second).\n- PNG is inherently lossless, so `png` codec is already lossless-friendly. No -crf or -preset needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf fps=0.2 -c:v png frame-%06d.png\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly extracts frames from the video every 5 seconds and saves them as PNG files, which fulfills the user's request. The parameters used are appropriate for the desired output format and method.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it provided is valid, works correctly, and follows the requirements specified by the user. There are no incorrect or nonexistent options present in the command.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements dictated therein. The options used are valid and do not conflict with the rules specified in the documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and is valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. Therefore, the model passes evaluation for this task."
