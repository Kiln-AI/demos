  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress `video.mp4` using the \"maximum efficiency\" preset (assumed to be the `veryslow` x264 preset for optimal compression), adjust the CRF (Constant Rate Factor) to reduce file size while maintaining acceptable quality, and copy the audio stream to avoid re-encoding it (saving time and preserving original audio).\n\n- `-preset veryslow` optimizes for maximum compression efficiency (longer encoding time, smaller file size).  \n- `-crf 28` reduces quality slightly compared to the default CRF 23, resulting in a smaller file size.  \n- `-c:a copy` retains the original audio codec and bit rate, avoiding unnecessary re-encoding.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -c:a copy video_compressed.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The user intends to use H.264 encoding (standard for MP4).  \n- Audio compression is not required; original audio is acceptable.  \n- The system has `libx264` installed. For even higher efficiency, consider `libx265` (HEVC) if supported.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output correctly addresses the user's request to compress `video.mp4` using a high-efficiency preset. The command uses the `libx264` codec, specifies a `-preset veryslow`, and includes a specific `-crf` value to control quality and thus file size. Therefore, it does not contain the issues described in the <issue_description>.\n\n2) The output does not resemble the failing example in <failure_example>. The command generated by the model is valid and properly structured according to FFmpeg syntax. The preset `veryslow` exists and is used correctly to maximize compression efficiency.\n\n3) The command follows the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The options are applied to the appropriate input and output files, and the command structure adheres to the general guidelines. The use of `-preset veryslow` and `-crf 28` are valid options recognized by FFmpeg without conflicting with each other or other settings. \n\n4) Based on the evaluation steps above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and adheres to the FFmpeg man page requirements. Thus, the output is valid and would work correctly for the stated task."
