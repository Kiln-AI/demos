  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To add blurred bars to the left and right of a vertical video (making it a 16:9 output), a common approach is:\n\n1. Set the output resolution to a standard 16:9 size (e.g., 1920x1080).\n2. Scale the original video to fit within the center vertical portion (e.g., 1080x1920 scaled so height=1080, width adjusted).\n3. Create a blurred background by scaling the original up and heavily blurring it.\n4. Overlay the scaled original on top of the blurred background.\n\nHere’s how you can do it using ffmpeg’s filter_complex:\n\n- We take the input twice: one for the blurred background, another for the sharp center.\n- For the background, we scale to fill 1920x1080, then apply a boxblur.\n- For the foreground, we scale the original to fit height=1080, then overlay in the center.\n\nAssuming `story.mov` is 1080x1920 (vertical, 9:16), and you want a 1920x1080 (16:9) output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"\n  [0:v]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=luma_radius=20:luma_power=3[bg];\n  [0:v]scale=-1:1080[fg];\n  [bg][fg]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2\n\" -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p story_wide.mp4\n```\n\nExplanations of the filters:\n- `scale=1920:1080` resizes the background to the output size.\n- `boxblur=luma_radius=20:luma_power=3` achieves a strong blur effect on the background.\n- `scale=-1:1080` resizes the foreground video to height=1080, width auto (keeps aspect).\n- `overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2` centers the foreground onto the blurred background.\n\nThis command preserves audio, uses H.264 for wide compatibility, and outputs yuv420p for compatibility with most players. Adjust the blur parameters for stronger/weaker blur as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - The command generated by the model seems to correctly fulfill the task of adding blurred bars to a vertical video to make it a 16:9 widescreen video. The command uses appropriate filters and settings based on the description provided by the user. There doesn't seem to be an obvious mistake in the ffmpeg command itself that would prevent it from functioning correctly, thus the model's output does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   - The output provided by the model is not similar to the failure example. The command includes valid parameters and complex filter usage, which demonstrates a proper understanding of how to manipulate video with ffmpeg. The failure example given (using an invalid preset) does not apply here as all parameters used appear to be valid.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command follows the syntax and structure outlined in the ffmpeg man page. It establishes an input, applies filter_complex correctly, and includes audio codecs without violating the structure of commands as presented in the man page. Therefore, it does not break any requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output should pass as it does not contain the issues described. The command appears to be valid, accurate, and meets the user's requirements. Thus, it would be evaluated as correct."
