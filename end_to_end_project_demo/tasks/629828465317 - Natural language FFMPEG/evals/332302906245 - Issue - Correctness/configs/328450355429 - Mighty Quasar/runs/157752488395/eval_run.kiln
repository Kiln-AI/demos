  "input": "Can you help me chain filters to rotate video and add fade effects? I need -vf 'transpose=1,fade=in:0:30;fade=out:270:30' to rotate 90 degrees clockwise and add fade in/out.",
  "output": "You can chain multiple filters in the -vf (video filter) option using commas. Each filter is applied in sequence. For your case:\n\n- transpose=1 rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- fade=in:0:30 adds a fade-in effect, starting at frame 0, lasting 30 frames.\n- fade=out:270:30 adds a fade-out effect, starting at frame 270, lasting 30 frames.\n\nNote: Use commas (not semicolons) to chain filters in -vf. Your filter string should look like: 'transpose=1,fade=in:0:30,fade=out:270:30'.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,fade=in:0:30,fade=out:270:30\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Your input is input.mp4 and you want to preserve audio (-c:a copy).\n- The fade parameters are in frames; 30 frames correspond to 1 second at 30fps.\n- You want a 90Â° clockwise rotation, fade-in over first 30 frames, and fade-out starting at frame 270.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not appear to contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command effectively accomplishes the user's request to chain filters for rotation and fade effects without any syntactical or logical errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The generated command is valid and serves the purpose described by the user, as opposed to the example where a non-existent preset was used. \n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. It utilizes recognized options and properly constructs the filter chain without violating any specified guidelines in the documentation.\n\n4) Given that the output does not demonstrate the described issue, does not resemble a failing output, and conforms to the man page requirements, it is fair to conclude that the model's output is correct and does not contain any errors. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
