  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To achieve this, you'll need to use `ffmpeg` to extract the video from stream 10 and the audio from stream 18 of your `broadcast.ts` file, and then merge them into a new file. This can be done using the `tee` filter and the `concat` demuxer.\n\nHere's the explanation and command:\n\n- We will use the `tee` filter to split the streams and then concatenate them again.\n- `-i broadcast.ts` specifies the input file.\n- `-filter_complex tee='=[out1][out2]'` splits the streams into two outputs.\n- `select=幕后视频` (stream 10) is used to select the 10th video stream.\n- `select=幕后音频` (stream 18) is used to select the 18th audio stream.\n- `-map [out1]` and `-map [out2]` are used to map the selected streams to the corresponding outputs.\n- `output.mp4` is the final output file that combines the video and audio streams.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -filter_complex \"tee='=[out1][out2]',[out1]select=幕后视频[v],[out2]select=幕后音频[a]\" -map [v] -map [a] -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: Ensure that the stream indices and labels (`幕后视频` and `幕后音频`) are correct based on the actual stream metadata of your `broadcast.ts` file.\n\nIf you're working with a more standard naming convention, you might use `-map 0:10` for the video stream and `-map 0:18` for the audio stream instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated uses incorrect filter syntax and terminology. The `tee` filter and the `select` syntax used (e.g., `select=幕后视频`, `select=幕后音频`) are not valid. Furthermore, the model did not appropriately use the `-map` option based on the stream indices as outlined.\n\n2) Yes, the model's output is similar to the given example of a failing output. It generates a command that is not executable due to the incorrect naming and syntax related to the selection of streams.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks several requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options and syntax used in the command do not align with the expected usage for selecting specific input streams and output mappings. The use of `tee` and incorrect `select` options do not adhere to how `ffmpeg` is designed to handle multiple input streams.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output fails the evaluation criteria due to incorrect command syntax and structure."
