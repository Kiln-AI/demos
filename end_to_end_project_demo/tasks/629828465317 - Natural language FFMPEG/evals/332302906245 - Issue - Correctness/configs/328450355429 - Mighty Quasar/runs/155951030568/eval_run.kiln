  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo convert your video.webm to MP4 while using the libvpx-vp9 codec (VP9 video codec) in constant bitrate (CBR) encoding, you need to:\n\n- Use `-c:v libvpx-vp9` to specify the VP9 video codec.\n- Use `-b:v` to set a target constant bitrate, for example 2000k (2000 kbps). Adjust this based on your quality and file size needs.\n- Note that VP9 in MP4 containers has limited browser compatibility (MP4 + VP9 is less common).\n- VP9 is more efficient (better quality at lower bitrates) than H.264 but requires more encoding time and storage.\n\nBecause MP4 support for VP9 is limited, consider if you really need this or if H.264 is more widely supported.\n\nAssuming you want a target rate of 2000k and keep the audio as it is:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2000k -c:a copy output-vp9.mp4\n```\n\nThis encodes the video to VP9 in an MP4 container with a constant bitrate of 2000 kbps, without re-encoding the audio. Note that some browsers may not play MP4+VP9 without custom codecs or support.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command it generated adheres to the user’s request to convert a .webm file to MP4 format using the libvpx-vp9 codec with a specified constant bitrate mode. The command is formed correctly and has appropriate parameters based on the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command produced is valid and does not contain incorrect or non-existing options or parameters, unlike the example of a failing output where an incorrect preset was specified.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters aligned with the expected usage for ffmpeg commands found in the man page — specifically the use of the codec, setting the bitrate, and copying the audio stream.\n\nOverall, the model's output was appropriate and correctly formatted, so it would pass according to the evaluation criteria."
