  "input": "I want to convert my video to H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset for better compression",
  "output": " Converting a video to the H.265 format using the veryfast2 preset requires a high encoding speed while maintaining acceptable video quality. The 'vfr' scale mode can be used to allow vertical scaling, ensuring compatibility with variable aspect ratios. The subtitles indicating the encoding preset can be included using overflow_output function. Here is the ffmpeg command for this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset veryfast2 -tune x265-hevc -x265-params parse=0x-vfr -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a copy -threads 4 -tune media -x265-params log=x265_log.txt -threads 4 -x265-params maxrate=2M 128k -x265-params ref=1 -x265-params lossless=1 -x265-params crf=31 output.mkv\n```\n\nThe selected parameters:\n\n- `-c:v libx265`: specifies H.265 video codec format.\n- `-preset veryfast2`: speeds up the encoding process with minimal quality loss.\n- `-tune x265-hevc`: selection of H.265/HEVC encoding presets best suited for high-quality output.\n- `-x265-params parse=0x-vfr`: limits the application of certain presets, allowing variable framerate and resolution.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: matches the pixel format version 4:2:0 which is widely supported by browsers and devices.\n- `-threads 4`: allocates 4 threads, balancing performance with system resource utilization.\n- `-tune media`: Select media-optimized encoding presets.\n- `-x265-params crf=31`: sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for H.265 coding, controlling the output quality.\n- `-x265-params ref=1` : promotes B frame distribution, reducing bandwidth usage.\n- `-x265-params lossless=1`: enables intraframe compression (decreases quality but lowers file size).\n- `-x265-params maxrate=2M`: sets the maximum bitrate.\n- `-x265-params log=x265_log.txt`: Generate an optional log file for troubleshooting encoding.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copy the audio stream directly without re-encoding.\n- `128k -x265-params ref=1`: sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\nNote: This conversion process might take a while, depending on the length and resolution of your video, as well as your computer's processing power.\n\n</output>",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain issues with the generated `ffmpeg` command. The command includes parameters and options that are incorrectly formatted or non-existent, particularly `-preset veryfast2` (it should be `veryfast` instead) and other redundant or inappropriate options, such as using multiple `-x265-params` in a confused way.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example, as it utilizes an incorrect preset and poorly structured parameters. While it does include the correct video codec specification (`libx265`), the presence of `veryfast2` as a preset itself is enough to classify this output as potentially non-functional.\n\n3) The command indeed breaks multiple requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. Specifically, `veryfast2` is not a recognized preset in `ffmpeg`. Additionally, the use of `-x265-params` contains confused options that are not valid, such as `parse=0x-vfr`. Additionally, `-x265-params log=x265_log.txt` should not be combined improperly like this, and it is normally not included in a command aimed at video transcoding for a typical task.\n\n4) Given all sources of evaluation, the model's output contains significant issues and would likely fail to execute correctly in `ffmpeg`. Therefore, the output should be marked as a failure."
