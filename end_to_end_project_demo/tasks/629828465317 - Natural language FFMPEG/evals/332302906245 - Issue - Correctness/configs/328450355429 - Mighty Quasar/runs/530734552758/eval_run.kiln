  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg - extract-audio -i video.mp4 -f flac output.flac\n```\n\nExplanation: In this command:\n\n* `-i video.mp4` specifies the input file.\n* `-f flac` outputs the audio in FLAC format.\n* `extract-audio` flag is not strictly needed, but it's a good practice for clarity.\n\nAssumptions: I assumed you want to output FLAC audio, since you mentioned FLAC. Also, I didn't specify encoding settings like `max-compression` because, technically, the ` flac` codec already uses maximum-compression. \n\nNote: The actual bitrate value is usually around 10-12 kbps for maximum-compression FLACs. \nIf you'd like to explore this further, consider setting `-bn 10` to ensure maximum-compression:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:a flac -b:a 10k output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \nYes, the output contains issues. The command generated by the model for extracting audio is incorrect. It uses `- extract-audio`, which is not a valid option in `ffmpeg`. Therefore, the command would fail when executed.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nYes, it is similar to the example of a failing output. The incorrect command format, specifically the `- extract-audio` part, resembles the inadequacy in the failure example where a non-existent preset was used. Both lead to invalid commands.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, it breaks requirements set in the man page. The option `- extract-audio` is invalid: `ffmpeg` does not recognize a command or flag by that name. The command format does not follow the structure required for `ffmpeg`, as seen in the man page where input and output options must be correctly structured without invalid or unsupported terms.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains a significant issue. Instead of generating a correct `ffmpeg` command, it used an invalid syntax, leading to errors when executed. Thus, it fails the evaluation criteria."
