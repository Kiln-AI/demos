  "input": "I need to convert my video to MP4 with a bitrate of 50000k for high quality output.",
  "output": "To convert your video to MP4 with a very high bitrate of 50000k (50 Mbps), I'll use H.264 encoding with constant bitrate mode. This will produce excellent quality output suitable for archival or professional use.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video encoding\n- `-b:v 50000k` sets the video bitrate to exactly 50 Mbps\n- `-maxrate 50000k` and `-bufsize 100000k` ensure consistent bitrate control\n- `-preset slow` optimizes for quality over speed (use `fast` if encoding time is a concern)\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 320k` uses high-quality AAC audio at 320 kbps\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\nI'm assuming you want to maintain the original resolution and that your input file is named something like `input.mov` or similar. Adjust the input filename as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -maxrate 50000k -bufsize 100000k -preset slow -c:a aac -b:a 320k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: 50 Mbps is an extremely high bitrate that will result in very large file sizes. Make sure this level of quality is actually needed for your use case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described here: \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated is valid and adheres to the requirements of converting a video to MP4 format with a specified bitrate of 50000k. The output includes appropriate options for specifying codec, bitrate, and format details. \n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output: \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated correctly uses valid options and parameters for FFmpeg and does not include any incorrect or non-existent options. \n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page? \nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All of the options used in the command are valid FFmpeg options as per the man page, and they are applied correctly corresponding to the input and output files. The model has successfully specified the input file and the necessary output options in a syntactically and semantically correct order.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? \nThe evaluation concludes that the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it produces a valid FFmpeg command that meets the user's request for a video conversion to MP4 at a bitrate of 50000k without any errors or unsupported options. Therefore, the output should pass."
