  "output": "ffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=2.0[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output.mp4",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It effectively constructs a command to double the speed of the video while maintaining the original audio pitch. The filters used (`setpts` for video and `atempo` for audio) are appropriate and widely used in the ffmpeg community for this specific task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command contains valid options and parameters that are recognized by ffmpeg. There are no references to non-existent presets or incorrect options within the command that would normally lead to failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-filter_complex` to apply both video and audio filters works correctly as per the documentation, and the parameters used for doubling speed (`setpts=0.5*PTS` and `atempo=2.0`) are correct.\n\n4) Therefore, given that the command is correctly structured and meets the input requirements, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a command that accurately fulfills the user's request to double the video speed while preserving the original audio pitch. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
