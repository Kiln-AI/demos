  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "I'll help you set specific bitrates, though I should note some important considerations about your requested values.\n\nFor setting specific bitrates, we use `-b:v` for video bitrate and `-b:a` for audio bitrate. However, there are some practical limitations to consider:\n\n**Audio bitrate of 500k**: This is extremely high for audio. Most high-quality audio uses 128-320 kbps. 500 kbps is possible but likely overkill unless you're working with very specific professional audio requirements.\n\n**Video bitrate of 100 Gbps**: This is not practically achievable with current codecs and hardware. Even uncompressed 4K video is typically around 1-3 Gbps. I'll assume you meant 100 Mbps, which is more reasonable for very high quality video.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 100M -b:a 500k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- Changed 100 Gbps to 100 Mbps (100M) for practical encoding\n- Used libx264 for video codec (you may want libx265/HEVC for better compression at high bitrates)\n- Used AAC for audio codec\n- Added `-preset slow` for better quality at high bitrates\n- Input/output filenames are placeholders\n\nIf you truly need maximum quality, consider using `-crf 0` (lossless) instead of bitrate control, or use a more modern codec like libx265.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is syntactically correct and should work correctly given the practical bitrate adjustments it made (specifically changing 100 Gbps to 100 Mbps). It also includes reasonable assumptions about the codecs and parameters. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The generated command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 100M -b:a 500k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4` uses correct syntax and parameters that exist in the ffmpeg documentation. There are no incorrect presets, parameters, or codecs.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The command correctly applies options to the input and output files and uses valid options for setting the video and audio bitrates. The provided parameters (`-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-c:v`, `-c:a`, `-preset`, etc.) are correctly used based on the functionalities described in the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described, so it should pass this evaluation. The command generated is correct and meets the user's requirements, except for the practical limitations on bitrate which it addressed appropriately."
