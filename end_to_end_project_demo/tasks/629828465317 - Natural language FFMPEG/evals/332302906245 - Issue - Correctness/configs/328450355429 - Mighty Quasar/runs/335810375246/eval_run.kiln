  "input": "Convert my video file to use a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and make it web-ready.",
  "output": "To convert your video to a web-ready format with a specific video bitrate of 50,000 kbps (50 Mbps), use H.264 video encoding (widely supported on the web) and AAC audio encoding. The `-movflags +faststart` option ensures the file is optimized for streaming by moving metadata to the beginning of the file. This assumes your input file is in a compatible format (e.g., MP4, AVI, etc.) and you want to retain the original resolution and aspect ratio.\n\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses H.264 video codec for web compatibility.\n- `-b:v 50000k`: Sets the video bitrate to 50,000 kbps.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encodes audio to AAC at 128 kbps (standard for web).\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Optimizes the MP4 file for streaming in browsers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n``` \n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Input file is `input.mp4` (replace with your actual filename).  \n- Audio is re-encoded to AAC for web compatibility.  \n- No resolution scaling is needed (original resolution is preserved).  \n- The video is already in a format suitable for web (e.g., MP4).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to correctly implement the user's request for a conversion to a bitrate of 50000k for the video stream and ensures that the output file is web-ready.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing example. The generated command is valid and uses existing options and parameters in FFmpeg appropriately, whereas the failure example used a non-existent preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly follows the structure outlined in the man page, specifying the input file, the output file, and the proper encoding options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue as it generated a valid ffmpeg command that meets the specifications provided by the user. Therefore, it should pass."
