  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "To convert a video and set its bitrate to an extremely high value of 50 Gbps, you can specify the bitrate with the `-b:v` (video bitrate) parameter. This command uses the H.264 codec for widespread compatibility, and applies the maximum bitrate you requested. Be aware that such a high bitrate results in very large output files and is usually impractical for typical storage, streaming, or playback. If the video is very short, or you want to encode for a specific use case requiring extreme detail, this is okay; otherwise, confirm this is what you want.\n\n- `-b:v 50000M` sets video bitrate to 50,000 Mbps (50 Gbps).\n- The `-c:v libx264` factory uses H.264. For even higher quality at this bitrate range, consider `-c:v libx265` (HEVC) or `-c:v libaom-av1` (AV1), though they also produce very large files.\n- Audio is copied with `-c:a copy` assuming you donâ€™t need audio encoding adjustments; otherwise, you should re-encode audio appropriately.\n- This omits output format assumptions; adjust output filename extension accordingly or force container type.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000M -c:a copy output_highbitrate.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- Input filename is `input.mp4`.  \n- Output is called `output_highbitrate.mp4`.  \n- Audio is copied unchanged (`-c:a copy`) for speed; change to re-encode if needed.  \n- The file length is manageable given the insane bitrate, or you are using a short test segment.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described in the **<issue_description>** section. While the command itself is syntactically correct and likely to execute without error, it is based on an impractical assumption about the request's requirement. Setting a video bitrate to 50 Gbps is extraordinarily high and not standard for most applications. This could confuse users and likely won't yield useful or playable results.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the **<failure_example>** provided because the command generated by the model does not contain any syntax errors. The command is properly formed and utilizes valid ffmpeg options. Therefore, it does not fall into the same failing category as the example given.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It adheres to the syntax required, and all options used are valid according to the documentation (e.g., `-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-c:a`). However, it does raise a conceptual issue since a bitrate of 50 Gbps is impractical, if not excessive, for most media encoding scenarios.\n\n4) Given these points, the model's output contains an issue that could lead to confusion or impractical results due to the unreasonable bitrate request, despite being syntactically correct. Thus, it should be marked as a failure."
