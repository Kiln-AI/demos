  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply a brightness filter, a contrast filter, and a scale filter to resize the video to 1080p, you can chain multiple filters together using the `filter:v` option. You can specify the brightness, contrast, and scale filters in a single string separated by commas.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The brightness and contrast adjustments will be provided as arguments to the `eq` filter, which is a general-purpose filter in FFmpeg for modifying video attributes like brightness and contrast.\n- The `scale` filter is used to resize the video to 1080p (1920x1080).\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter:v \"eq=brightness=0.1,contrast=1.5,scale=1920:1080\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `eq=brightness=0.1,contrast=1.5`: This applies the eq filter (equalization) with a brightness adjustment of 0.1 (which is a relative adjustment, 0 being black and 1 being as bright as possible) and a contrast adjustment of 1.5 (higher values increase contrast).\n- `scale=1920:1080`: This scales the video to a 1080p resolution, maintaining the aspect ratio by setting the width to 1920 and height to 1080.\n\nThis command will apply the filters in sequence and output the adjusted video at 1080p.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command is valid and matches the requirements from the user, applying brightness and contrast filters, followed by a scaling filter to resize the video to 1080p.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model is properly formatted and does not contain non-existent options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The filters used (eq for brightness and contrast, scale for resizing) are valid, and the command respects the typical requirements for FFmpeg command structure and options.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described, I would judge that it **passes** the evaluation. The command is well-constructed and meets the user's request effectively."
