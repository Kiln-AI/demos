  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To convert the 5.1 surround sound audio in `concert.mp4` to stereo while mixing the rear channels (SL and SR) at 50% volume, the `pan` audio filter is used. This filter allows precise control over how channels are combined. The rear channels are mixed into the front channels (FL and FR) at reduced volume. The `-c:v copy` option preserves the video stream without re-encoding, and `-c:a aac` ensures AAC encoding for broad compatibility.\n\n**Technique/Parameters Explanation:**\n- `pan=stereo:FL+0.5*SL|FR+0.5*SR`: Combines the front left (FL) and rear left (SL) into the left channel, and front right (FR) with rear right (SR) into the right channel, with SL and SR at 50% volume.\n- `-c:v copy`: Retains the original video codec and stream to avoid re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac`: Uses AAC audio encoding for browser compatibility and quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -af \"pan=stereo:FL+0.5*SL|FR+0.5*SR\" -c:v copy -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain any issues related to generating an incorrect or non-functional command. The command produced for converting the 5.1 surround sound audio in `concert.mp4` to stereo sound and mixing the rear channels at 50% volume follows the ffmpeg syntax correctly and meets the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. In contrast to the shown example that includes a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), the output from the model correctly implements existing ffmpeg options and filters.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements as stated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of the `-i` input option, the audio filter (`-af`), and the codec options are all valid. The command follows the expected format and adheres to the described acceptable parameters and options.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output does not contain the issue as described. The generated command is correct, well-structured, and faithfully addresses the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
