  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "To preserve as much detail as possible, you can set the video bitrate to an extremely high value (50 gigabits per second, which is 50,000M or 50,000,000k). This will result in a huge output file and far exceeds common use cases, but ffmpeg will accept a large bitrate if your output container supports it. Assume you want .mp4 output with H.264, which usually tops out at lower bitrates, so you may want to use a lossless codec like FFV1 or ProRes if this is for archival/mastering. For H.264, however, here's how you enforce a 50 Gbps bitrate:\n\n- -b:v 50000M sets the video bitrate to 50,000 megabits per second.\n- -maxrate and -bufsize are not strictly necessary unless you’re targeting constrained bitrate, but can be set to the same for strict constant bitrate.\n- All other parameters left default except codecs.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000M -c:a copy output_50gbps.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-b:v 50000M` sets the video bitrate to 50,000 megabits/sec (= 50 Gbps).\n- `-c:a copy` preserves the original audio (change to, e.g., `-c:a aac -b:a 320k` if you want to re-encode).\n- Replace `input.mp4` and `output_50gbps.mp4` with your input/output filenames.\n\n**Note:** Most codecs and formats will not genuinely preserve every bit of detail at any (even extreme) bitrate unless they're designed to be lossless. For true lossless archiving, consider using `-c:v ffv1` or `-c:v prores_ks -profile:v 4` instead. Let me know if you’d like that command instead.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated appears to follow the FFmpeg command structure and syntax properly. The command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000M -c:a copy output_50gbps.mp4` is valid for setting a high bitrate, and all specified options seem appropriate.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is syntactically correct and does not reference non-existent options or presets. It clearly defines the input and output files and specifies the required options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It uses valid options and parameters consistent with FFmpeg's syntax. The `-b:v 50000M` option correctly sets the video bitrate, and preparing the audio with `-c:a copy` seems appropriate as well.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output does not contain any issues according to the described evaluation steps. It correctly generates an FFmpeg command that aligns with the user's requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
