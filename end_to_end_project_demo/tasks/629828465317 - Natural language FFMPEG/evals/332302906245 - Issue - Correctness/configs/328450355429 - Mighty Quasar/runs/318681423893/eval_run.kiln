  "input": "Convert my video.webm to MP4 format using libvpx-vp9 codec with constant bitrate mode",
  "output": "To convert your `video.webm` file to MP4 format while using the `libvpx-vp9` codec in constant bitrate (CBR) mode, you need to ensure that the container (MP4) is compatible with VP9, which is not natively supported. Therefore, we'll use a workaround by transrating to a different format (like AVI or MKV) first and then re-encoding to MP4 with the VP9 codec. However, since MP4 doesn't support VP9 natively, it's more practical to use a different container like WebM or to transcode to H.264/MP4 if you specifically want an MP4 file.\n\nAssuming your goal is to keep the VP9 codec but in an MP4 container (which is not standard), you may need to use a non-standard approach or consider using a different codec for MP4 compatibility. For native MP4 support, H.264 is the standard choice. \n\nIf you truly want to maintain VP9 and MP4 container (which is not recommended), you would need to use a non-standard container or a different approach. However, for a standard MP4 file, here is the typical conversion using H.264:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.webm -c:v libx264 -b:v 5M -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-i video.webm`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses the H.264 video codec for MP4 compatibility.\n- `-b:v 5M`: Sets the video bitrate to 5 Mbps (constant bitrate).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding (if it's compatible with MP4).\n- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file.\n\n**Note:** MP4 does not support the VP9 codec directly. If you want to use VP9 in an MP4 container, this is not feasible without using a non-standard or experimental approach. If the goal is to keep the VP9 codec, consider using the WebM container instead.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. It produced a command that uses the H.264 codec for an MP4 file, which is indeed compatible, instead of creating an output that matches the user's request to use the `libvpx-vp9` codec. Furthermore, the model accurately discussed the limitations and facts about using VP9 within an MP4 container, but it did not fulfill the user's requirement to use the VP9 codec specifically.\n\n2) The output does not quite resemble the example of a failing output stated, since the command itself is likely valid. However, it does fail to meet the user's input requirements, as it does not implement the requested `libvpx-vp9` codec.\n\n3) The command provided does not break any requirements dictated in the man page; it follows the correct syntax and uses options that are accepted by ffmpeg. However, the basic requirement of adhering to the userâ€™s initial request is not fulfilled, which is a significant aspect of this evaluation.\n\n4) The model's output contains the issue described and thus should be marked as a failure. The command generated, while technically sound, does not fulfill the user's requirement to convert the file using the `libvpx-vp9` codec in a manner consistent with their request. Instead, it opts for H.264, which deviates from what was asked. Therefore, the evaluation concludes that the output is not satisfactory."
