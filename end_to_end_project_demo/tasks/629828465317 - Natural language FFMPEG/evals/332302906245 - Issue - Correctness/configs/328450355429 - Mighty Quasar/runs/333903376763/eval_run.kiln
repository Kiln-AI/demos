  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with the highest compression, you can use the `-c:a flac` codec and `-compression_level 12` (maximum compression level for FLAC). The video stream will be discarded by using `-vn`.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac`) is coherent with the user's request to extract audio and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression. The command performs the required action of disabling the video stream and applying the correct audio codec and compression level.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example because there are no incorrect options in the command. In the given output, each parameter has been applied appropriately and with valid options that exist in the ffmpeg man page.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page of ffmpeg. All the parameters used are correctly specified and adhere to the appropriate syntax. The use of `-c:a flac` is valid for setting the audio codec, `-vn` is necessary to suppress the video stream, and `-compression_level 12` is the highest compression setting for FLAC audio, which is also valid according to ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Based on these evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus passes the evaluation. The output is correct, matches the user's request, and adheres to the requirements of the ffmpeg man page."
