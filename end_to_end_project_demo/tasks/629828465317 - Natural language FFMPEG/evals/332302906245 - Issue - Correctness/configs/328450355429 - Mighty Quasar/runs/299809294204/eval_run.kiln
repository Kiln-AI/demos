  "input": "Convert input.avi to MP4 with 720p resolution, but I need both variable bitrate encoding and fixed bitrate of 2000k for consistent streaming.",
  "output": "When you want both \"variable bitrate\" and a \"fixed bitrate of 2000k,\" it's important to clarify that:\n\n- Variable bitrate (VBR) typically means quality-targeted encoding (using `-crf`), where the bitrate fluctuates depending on content complexity.\n- Fixed bitrate (CBR) uses a set bitrate (e.g., `-b:v 2000k`), but technically ffmpeg's CBR is more like constrained VBR unless you use strict parameters.\n\nFor streaming with more consistent bitrate:\n\n- Use `-b:v 2000k` to set the average/target video bitrate.\n- Use `-maxrate 2000k` and `-bufsize 4000k` to constrain the bitrate, effectively simulating CBR as closely as possible.\n- Set audio to AAC at a reasonable bitrate.\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` for web playback.\n- Use `-vf scale=-2:720` for 720p, keeping aspect ratio.\n\nAssumptions: You want H.264 video, 720p output, consistent streaming compatible with browsers, and both reasonably stable (constrained) bitrate and output file size control.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000k -maxrate 2000k -bufsize 4000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command uses constrained VBR for the video stream, targeting 2000k bitrate, suitable for consistent streaming.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly addresses the user's request to convert a video to MP4 with a specific bitrate and seeks to balance variable and fixed bitrate encoding appropriately. The model made clear comments about the parameters being set in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and does not contain any nonsensical parameters or deprecated settings like the `-preset extra_fast` which doesn't exist. The command is well-structured and adheres to the expected input syntax for ffmpeg.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The parameters used in the command, such as `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`, are all valid and correctly used according to the man page guidelines. All the provided options warrant their appropriate placement relative to the input and output files, maintaining logical order and adherence to standard ffmpeg syntax.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output successfully creates a valid ffmpeg command that aligns with the user's input and does not contain issues as per the criteria described. The evaluation is successful; hence it passes as it generates a correct and functional command for the specified task."
