  "output": "To create a universally compatible video file that plays on virtually any device (smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, older and newer browsers), use the most widely supported format: MP4 container with H.264 Baseline profile video and AAC LC audio. The Baseline profile sacrifices advanced compression features for maximum compatibility, especially with older mobile devices.\n\n- `profile:v baseline -level 3.0` ensures compatibility with the largest range of devices including older smartphones\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` is the most compatible pixel format\n- `-movflags +faststart` enables progressive download for web streaming\n- Constant bitrate (CBR) audio (-b:a 128k) rather than VBR improves compatibility with older devices\n- `preset slow` maximizes compression while keeping the Baseline profile constraints\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -preset slow -crf 23 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -ar 44100 -ac 2 -movflags +faststart output_universal.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is structured correctly, and it uses parameters suitable for achieving maximum compatibility across devices, aligning with the user's request.\n\n2) The output of the model is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated appears to be valid and utilizes existing options and parameters correctly. None of the options or parameters (like `preset slow` or `profile:v baseline`) are nonexistent or misused.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page against the command produced, the command follows the correct syntax rules. Each option is applied appropriately to the output file without any conflicting or misplaced options. All parameters used are valid according to the documentation provided.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, does not mirror a failing example, and complies with the man page's standards, it can be concluded that the command works correctly and matches the user's requirements. Thus, it passes evaluation."
