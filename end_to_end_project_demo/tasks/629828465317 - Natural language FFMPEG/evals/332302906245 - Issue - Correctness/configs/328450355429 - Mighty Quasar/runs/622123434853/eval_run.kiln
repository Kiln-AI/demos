  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To achieve the desired effect (temporal noise reduction → spatial denoising → edge enhancement), you need to apply these video filters in the correct sequence using the `vf` (video filter) option in `ffmpeg`.\n\n### Explanation of the filters:\n1. **`tmcdnn(noise=30:trellis=10)` (Temporal Noise Reduction)**: This filter reduces flicker or noise over time between frames. The typical input file must be in raw.U format if using the full `tmcdnn` plugin, but if it's part of your system's normal filters (as in some configurations), values like `noise=30` and `trellis=10` affect noise suppression and trellis motion estimation.\n\n2. **`hqdn3d()` (Spatial Denoising)**: This filter smooths spatial noise in images. Its default settings are usually sufficient, but you can adjust brightness, strength, etc.\n\n3. **`unsharp()` (Edge Enhancement)**: This filter sharpens edges using unsharp masking. The syntax is `unsharp=lx:ly:cx:cy:threshold`, where `lx` and `ly` are the luma sharpening parameters, and `cx`, `cy` for chroma.\n\nWe assume:\n- Your system supports the `tmcdnn` filter. If not, you may need to use a different temporal noise reduction method like `tblut`, `mctemporal`, or custom scripts.\n- `hqdn3d` and `unsharp` are available by default in most `ffmpeg` builds.\n\n### Command for applying the filters in the correct order:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"tmcdnn(noise=30:trellis=10),hqdn3d,unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0:0\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation of the command:\n- `tmcdnn(noise=30:trellis=10)` runs first for temporal denoising.\n- `hqdn3d` removes spatial noise.\n- `unsharp=5:5:1.0:1.0:0` enhances edges using luma parameters of 5x5 and a strength of 1.0 (tweak this based on your desired sharpness).\n- `c:a copy` keeps the audio unchanged.\n\n> **Note:** Replace `tmcdnn(...)` if that filter is unavailable in your `ffmpeg` installation. You can use `mctemporal` instead for basic temporal filtering or look for a plug-in implementation.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the specific issue described, as it effectively generates a plausible and coherent FFmpeg command that combines the specified filters correctly in the desired order. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The output correctly utilizes existing FFmpeg filters without introducing a nonexistent option or parameter, unlike the example provided.\n\n3) After reviewing the command within the context of the FFmpeg man page, it adheres to the specifications set out, with appropriate syntax and order of application for the filters. Each of the filters used (tmcdnn, hqdn3d, and unsharp) is valid, and there are no violations present in the requirements dictated in the man page.\n\n4) Since the command generated by the model is valid and meets the user's request, the model's output does not contain the issue described and therefore should be considered a pass."
