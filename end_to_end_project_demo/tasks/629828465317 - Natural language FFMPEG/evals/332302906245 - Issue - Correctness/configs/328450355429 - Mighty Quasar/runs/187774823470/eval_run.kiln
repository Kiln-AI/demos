  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "To convert a video to both H.265 (HEVC) and H.264 codecs simultaneously in the same output file, you can use ffmpeg’s multi-resolution encoding or a forced main or high feature, but the most straightforward way is to mux the H.265 stream with an H.264 stream to the output, using a container that supports both (like MKV or WebM), or place both as separate streams if the container supports it.\n\nHowever, MKV and WebM containers don't natively support both H.264 and H.265 simultaneously in a single stream. The best approach is to mux both streams separately into a single output file as separate streams (BNC) or create a container that supports both codecs.\n\nFor example, output in MKV:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -c copy -map 0 -ids_flag 0 -b:v 0 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nor:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c copy -map 0 -map 1 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding (if codecs match).\n- `-map 0` is the input, `-map 1` is the duplicate input with all codecs (if all codecs are audio only, this just duplicates audio).\n- `-ids_flag 0` stops stream ID copying to avoid errors.\n\nBetter if content includes multiple streams including video (not just audio).\n\nFor a true simultaneous codec output, the only way is to mux H.265 and H.264 streams to the output container, using `-map` to specify streams and `-c copy` for stream copy to avoid re-encoding but the container may not be compatible.\n\nIf container compatibility is key, use WebM for H.265/VP9 and H.264/VP8 where both codecs are supported, or if you need raw streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -c:v hevc output_h265.mp4 -c:v libx264 output_h264.mp4\n```\n\nBut this is not muxing simultaneously.\n\nSummary:\n\n- **MKV container:** mux H.265 and H.264 streams as separate streams (best compatibility).\n- **WebM container:** mux H.265/VP9 and H.264/VP8 streams—uses VP9 + VP8 or HEVC for video, and AAC for audio (stream copy).\n- **Raw streams:** export H.265 and H.264 separately as raw formats.\n\nAssumed your input is input.mp4 with H.264/AAC.\n\nHere's an example to mux streams as separate streams in MKV:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -c copy -map 0:v -map 0:a \\\n  -c copy -map 0:v -map 0:a \\\n  output.mkv\n```\n\nThis outputs MKV with H.264 video and AAC audio streams alongside the original H.264/AAC stream.\n\nHere are examples for better compatibility of H.264 in WMV:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -c:v copy -map 0:v -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -map 0:a \\\n  output WMV_h264.mkv\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -c:v copy -map 0:v -c:v hevc -b:v 0 -c:a copy \\\n  -c:v copy -map 0:v -c:v hevc -b:v 0 -c:a copy \\\n  output WMV_h265.mkv\n```\n\nIf you want a single output with both codecs in one streams, FFmpeg does not natively support.\n\nTo ensure you're using the H.265/HEVC codec in output, check codec output.\n\nIn summary, to get a file with both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same container, use container muxing of separate streams rather than single-stream re-encoding. If compatibility is key, MKV is the best container so far for H.265 and H.264 codecs.\n\nFor example, to mux both streams in MKV in one file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 \\\n  -map 0:v -map 0:a -c copy \\\n  -c:v copy -maps 0:v -c:v copy -maps 0:a \\\n  output.mkv\n```\n\nThis does not explicitly re-encode either stream, which avoids quality loss and re-encoding time.\n\n---\n\n**Best Practice/Assumptions:**\n- Your input is input.mp4 with your desired codecs and container support.\n- For compatibility choose MKV for both codecs.\n- No transcoding required; streams are copied.\n- Two outputs showing H.264 first and H.265 separately demonstrate the approach but are final outputs of separate muxing.\n- If you want to keep everything in a single output, split streams into separate files.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion/Summary Command for simultaneous H.264 and H.265 codecs muxed as separate streams in the same file:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a -c copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output contains several issues based on the provided evaluation criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model fails to generate a correct command that achieves the user's request to convert the video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file. The provided command with `-c copy` does not correctly create separate streams for both codecs as required. Instead, it tries to copy the input streams without changing the codecs, which does not satisfy the user's request for separate codec outputs in a single file.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - Yes, the output resembles the failing example in that it generates a command that does not fulfill the user's request and has incorrect syntax in how it attempts to implement the conversion. Specifically, the command incorrectly uses `-c copy` multiple times and incorrectly references `-map`. This could potentially lead to errors when executed, similar to the failure of the `extra_fast` preset in the provided example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - Yes, the command does not follow the proper syntax as specified in the man page. The repeated use of `-c copy` and `-map` with incorrect indices, especially when trying to map streams that do not exist (e.g., `-map 1` without having defined it), is problematic. The man page clearly states that options apply to the next specified file and the order of streams must be respected.\n\nIn summary, the command generated by the model is incorrect and does not meet the user's request, leading to a failure in the task evaluation based on all considered criteria."
