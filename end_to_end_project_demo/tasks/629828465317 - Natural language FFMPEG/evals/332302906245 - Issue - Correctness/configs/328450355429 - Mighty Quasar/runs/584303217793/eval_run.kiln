  "output": "To extract the second video stream (`stream 0:1`) and the fourth audio track (`stream 0:3`) from a multi-stream file (`input.avi`) and save them into a new `result.mp4` file, the following command will work:\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index 1) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3) from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- This assumes that the video and audio streams are compatible with the MP4 container and do not require any re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command it generated correctly matches the requirements set forth by the user, which is to extract the specified video and audio streams from the input file and save them in the output file. The use of `-map` options and the copy codec flags (`-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`) demonstrate that the command is appropriate for the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and uses valid ffmpeg options as per the userâ€™s request, which is not the case with the example of a failing output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements according to the ffmpeg man page. The output respects the order of options before and after the input and output file specification, using `-map` correctly to select the appropriate streams, and applies them effectively without re-encoding the streams in a compatible format for the MP4 container.\n\nTaking all of this into account, the model's output is confirmed to be correct, and it effectively executes the task as specified by the user, passing the evaluation criteria."
