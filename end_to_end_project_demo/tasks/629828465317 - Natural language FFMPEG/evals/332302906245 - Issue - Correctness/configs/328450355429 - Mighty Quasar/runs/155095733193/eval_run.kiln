  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark to your video, the `overlay` filter is used with an alpha channel to control transparency. The watermark image (`logo.png`) will be placed in the bottom-left corner using dynamic positioning to ensure it aligns properly regardless of the video's resolution. Since `logo.png` must have an alpha channel for transparency, we dynamically apply the `alpha` parameter. If the image lacks transparency, you may need to preprocess it using tools like GIMP or Photoshop.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=10:h-ih-10:alpha=0.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-i logo.png`: Specifies the watermark image.\n- `overlay=10:h-ih-10`: Positions the watermark 10 pixels from the left edge (`x=10`) and 10 pixels from the bottom (`y=h-ih-10`), where `h` is the video height and `ih` is the watermark height.\n- `alpha=0.5`: Sets the watermark's opacity to 50% (semi-transparent). Adjust this value between `0` (fully transparent) and `1` (fully opaque).\n- `-c:a copy`: Retains the original audio stream without re-encoding (assumes compatibility). Use `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` if you want to re-encode audio for streaming compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output **does not** contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command and its parameters seem appropriate for adding a semi-transparent watermark to a video. The model correctly describes the use of the `overlay` filter and the placement of the watermark, and the command generated is syntactically correct.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output example. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[0:v][1:v] overlay=10:h-ih-10:alpha=0.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4`) contains valid options and syntactically correct parameters which correspond to the intended functionality.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. Each part of the command is appropriate, and the command line syntax correctly follows the stipulations outlined in the man page.\n\nIn summary, the model's output successfully meets the requirements specified by the user, generating a command that aligns with `ffmpeg` syntax and functionality for the task of watermarking a video. Therefore, it passes the evaluation without issues."
