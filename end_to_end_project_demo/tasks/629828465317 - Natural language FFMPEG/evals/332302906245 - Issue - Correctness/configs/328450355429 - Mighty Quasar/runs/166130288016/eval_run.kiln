  "input": "Please help me encode a video with a bitrate of 2000000k to ensure maximum quality.",
  "output": "To encode a video with a fixed bitrate of 2000000 kbps (2 Mbps), you should:\n\n- Set the video codec to libx264 (H.264), which is widely supported and efficient.\n- Specify the exact target bitrate using -b:v 2000000k.\n- Use the -maxrate and -bufsize options to enforce true constant bitrate (CBR) with CBR parameters: -maxrate 2000000k and -bufsize (generally set to 2 to 4x the bitrate).\n- Use -c:a aac for compatible audio, and optionally adjust audio bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart is recommended for MP4 files for better streaming.\n- The pixel format yuv420p ensures good playback compatibility.\n\nAssumption: You want to create an MP4 file. If you prefer a different container, adjust accordingly.\n\nExplanation:\n- -c:v libx264: Use H.264 encoding for broad compatibility.\n- -b:v 2000000k: Set video bitrate to 2 Mbps.\n- -maxrate 2000000k: Enforce maximum bitrate to match target.\n- -bufsize 8000k: Set buffer size (typically 4x bitrate for CBR).\n- -movflags +faststart: For faster playback start in browsers/players.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p: Ensures compatibility.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k: Converts audio to AAC at 192 kbps (adjust as needed).\n- input.mp4 is your source; output.mp4 will be created.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000000k -maxrate 2000000k -bufsize 8000k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.mp4\n```\n\nRemember, CRF (constant rate factor) or QP (quantization parameter) coding usually gives better quality per bitrate than CBR, if strict bitrate is not required. However, the command above achieves your stated goal using fixed bitrate.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation steps. The generated command appears correct based on the user's request to encode a video with a specified bitrate of 2000000 kbps, suitable for achieving maximum quality. All specified parameters align with the requirements for setting both video and audio encoding appropriately.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The output does not contain any incorrect options or parameters. The generated command is valid and logically structured according to FFmpeg's syntax.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command generated by the model does not break any of the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It adheres to the expected structure and correctly applies options as specified. All options used (such as `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, etc.) are valid FFmpeg options, and their order is appropriate.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output should pass as it does not contain any issues. The command generated is correct, follows the documentation, and matches the requirements from the user without any errors."
