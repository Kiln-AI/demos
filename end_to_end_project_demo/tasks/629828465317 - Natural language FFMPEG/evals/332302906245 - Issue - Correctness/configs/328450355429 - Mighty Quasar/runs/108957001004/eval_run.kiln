  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To chain multiple video filters in FFmpeg, you use the `-vf` option and separate each filter with a comma. The filters are applied in the order they appear in the chain. Here's how to overlay text and apply a blur effect:\n\n*   **Drawtext:** This filter adds text to the video. You can customize various properties like fontfile, text, x, y, fontcolor, box, and boxcolor.\n*   **Boxblur:** This filter applies a blur effect to the video. You can adjust the luma\\_radius to control the intensity of the blur, and luma\\_power to adjust the blur's falloff.\n\nI'm assuming you have a font file available. Here's the command accomplishing your request:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:text='Your Text Here':x=100:y=100:fontcolor=white:box=1:boxcolor=black@0.5,boxblur=5:1\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n*   `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file.\n*   `-vf`: Indicates the use of video filters.\n*   `drawtext=fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:text='Your Text Here':x=100:y=100:fontcolor=white:box=1:boxcolor=black@0.5`: Adds the specified text.\n    *   Replace `/path/to/font.ttf` with the actual path to your font file.\n    *   `text='Your Text Here'` is the text to display.\n    *   `x=100:y=100` sets the position (adjust as needed).\n    *   `fontcolor=white` sets the text color to white.\n    *   `box=1:boxcolor=black@0.5` adds a semi-transparent black box behind the text for better visibility.\n*   `,boxblur=5:1`: Applies a blur effect.\n    *   `boxblur=5:1` sets the blur radius to 5. The second parameter controls the blur power, adjust as needed.\n*   `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding. This preserves the original audio quality and speeds up the process.\n*   `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file name. Remember to choose an appropriate output file extension based on your desired format.\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is syntactically correct and follows the proper FFmpeg command structure. It appropriately chains multiple video filters with the `-vf` option and uses commas to separate them. Therefore, the command should function correctly, given the user's requirements.\n\n2) The output provided by the model is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated is valid and does not reference any nonexistent option or parameter. Unlike the failure example, where an invalid preset was used, the model's command effectively applies video filters and matches the user's request.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All options used in the command are valid according to the documentation, including the proper usage of filters (`drawtext` and `boxblur`) and the format of the command. The model correctly copies the audio stream without re-encoding, which is appropriate for this scenario.\n\n4) Based on the analysis above, the output does not contain any issues as described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation correctly."
