  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To allow the specified bitrate, instead of constant bitrate (`-b:v`), we can use Variable Bitrate Variable (VBR) encoding with a constant maximum bitrate (`-bufferallocation`). Here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -vcodec Moffit -b:v -b:v:0 5000 -map_metadata 1 -f mp4 output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n\n- We use `-vcodec moffit` as the codec, which allows us to reserve max kbits (but may not use all) instead of actual kbits.\n- `-map_metadata 1` ensures all metadata is preserved.\n- We haven't got this exact command well-documented, this may vary depending on ffmmpeg version\n- It may need compatibilityRTC settings to support modern mp4 validations",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues described in the issue description. Specifically, the command generated contains incorrect syntax and invalid option usage for setting the video bitrate. The correct flag for specifying the bitrate is `-b:v 5000k` instead of `-b:v -b:v:0 5000`. Additionally, the codec specified as `Moffit` is not a valid codec in `ffmpeg`. Therefore, the command will not work as intended and will likely result in an error.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example in that it generates an invalid ffmpeg command. However, the command doesn't have a completely non-existent component like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`, but it does incorrectly use non-standard options and invalid syntax, which leads to command failure.\n\n3) Yes, the command breaks specific requirements in the man page. The flag usage for bitrate is incorrectly formatted, and `-vcodec Moffit` is invalid as `Moffit` is not an available codec within `ffmpeg`. Moreover, the output format flag typically should contain `-f` followed by the format (if necessary), which it seems is missing.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output fails since it contains invalid options and syntax, violating the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page."
