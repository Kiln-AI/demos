  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "Setting a video bitrate of 50 Gbps is extremely high and likely a typo (you probably meant 50 Mbps or 50 Mb/s). However, if this is intentional, it would result in an astronomically large file size and may not be practical for most use cases. For realistic conversions, 50 Mbps is a more reasonable value for preserving detail without excessive file size. Assuming you meant 50 Mbps, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 50M output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-b:v 50M` sets the video bitrate to 50 Mbps (a common high-quality setting).\n- The container (MP4) and codec (H.264 by default) are used unless specified otherwise.\n- If you **intended 50 Gbps**, the command would be `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 50G output.mp4`, but this would create an impractically large file (e.g., ~6 GB per minute of video). Verify your intended bitrate before proceeding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It provided a command that would work correctly despite the initial high bitrate request from the user. The model rightly assumed that the user might have meant 50 Mbps instead of 50 Gbps and generated a command using this more realistic value. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command presented by the model is syntactically correct and uses valid options as per the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n3) As per the `ffmpeg` man page, the command `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 50M output.mp4` is correctly formatted and adheres to the stipulated requirements. It uses the `-b:v` option to set the video bitrate in bits per second, which is in alignment with how bitrate settings work in ffmpeg. Moreover, providing an alternate command for 50 Gbps shows the model's awareness of potential misuse, but it does not propose an impractical command.\n\n4) Given the evaluations above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it successfully adheres to the requirements and produces a valid command suitable for the user's request. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
