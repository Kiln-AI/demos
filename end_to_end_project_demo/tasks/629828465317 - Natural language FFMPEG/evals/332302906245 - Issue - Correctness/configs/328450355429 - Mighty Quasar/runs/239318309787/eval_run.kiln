  "output": "To add subtitles to your video and remove any existing subtitle tracks, you should use the following approach:\n\n- Use the -i subtitle.file to add your desired subtitles (e.g., SRT, WebVTT).\n- Use -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s to only keep the video, all audio tracks, and your external subtitle (input file 0 is your video, file 1 is your subtitle).\n- Use -c copy for video and audio to avoid re-encoding (fast, lossless).\n- Use -c:s mov_text or webvtt depending on your desired subtitle format inside the MP4/MOV container (check your file type).\n\nAssumption: You’re using a common container like MP4 or MOV. If your video is in a different format, let me know.\n\nHere's how you’d add subtitles from subtitle.srt to video.mp4, removing any original subtitle tracks:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i subtitle.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c copy -c:s mov_text -movflags +faststart output_with_subs.mp4\n```\n\nThis command combines the video, all audio tracks, and your subtitle, outputting to output_with_subs.mp4. The -movflags +faststart ensures streaming compatibility.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output from the model does not contain the issue described. The command generated accurately adds subtitles and removes existing subtitle tracks as requested by the user. The parameters and mapping are correct according to the provided user input.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated by the model is well-structured, follows appropriate syntax, and utilizes existing subtitle codecs appropriately. It does not contain an incorrect command or an invalid option.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements indicated in the man page. The use of `-map`, `-c copy`, `-c:s mov_text`, and the overall structure of the command adhere to the specifications described. The model appropriately references the necessary subtitle options according to the commands described in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described; the command works correctly and fulfills the user request. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
