  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress `video.mp4` for maximum storage efficiency, use the `libx265` video codec (HEVC) since it offers significantly better compression than H.264 for the same quality. The x265 encoder offers a `-preset` with `veryslow` or even `placebo` to maximize compression at the cost of encoding time. The CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value around 28 is common for high compression (lower value = higher quality).\n\n- `-c:v libx265` uses the efficient HEVC codec.\n- `-preset veryslow` (or even `placebo` for \"maximum_efficiency\", though gains are minimal beyond `veryslow`) maximizes compression.\n- `-crf 28` trades off bitrate for smaller file size; increase CRF for even smaller files but lower quality.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 96k` uses efficient AAC audio at a reasonably low bitrate.\n- `-tag:v hvc1` ensures better compatibility with some players.\n\nAssumption: \"maximum_efficiency preset\" refers to the slowest x265 preset (`veryslow` or `placebo`). Change CRF value to taste if you want better quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -crf 28 -tag:v hvc1 -c:a aac -b:a 96k output_hevc.mp4\n```\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - No, the model’s output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be correctly structured and relevant to the user’s request to compress a video while prioritizing storage efficiency.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model’s output is not similar to the given failure example. The command is valid and uses proper syntax, while the failing example included a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`).\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - No, the command does not break any requirements as outlined in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (such as `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-crf`, and `-c:a`) are valid and appropriate for the task. The order of options is correct, and required elements (like input and output files) are present.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model does NOT contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is well-structured, valid, and complies with the requirements of the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
