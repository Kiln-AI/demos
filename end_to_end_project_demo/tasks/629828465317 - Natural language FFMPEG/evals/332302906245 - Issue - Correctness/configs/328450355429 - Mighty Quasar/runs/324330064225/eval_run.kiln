  "input": "Convert my video `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4, but lock the bitrate to exactly 5000 kb/s using the VBR setting.",
  "output": "To convert `raw_footage.mxf` into an MP4 while targeting a video bitrate of exactly 5000 kbps using variable bitrate (VBR), you can set the average bitrate with `-b:v 5000k`. In FFmpeg, VBR is the default mode when using `-b:v` but to control quality and bitrate more precisely, we often use CRF plus max bitrate. However, since you want bitrate locked exactly at 5000 kbps in VBR, setting `-minrate`, `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` equal will control the bitrate tightly around 5000 kbps.\n\nI'll use libx264 encoder with VBR constrained by setting minrate, maxrate, and bufsize all to 5000k to clamp bitrate close to 5000 kbps.\n\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the average target bitrate.\n- `-minrate 5000k` ensures bitrate will not go below 5000 kbps.\n- `-maxrate 5000k` ensures bitrate will not exceed 5000 kbps.\n- `-bufsize 10000k` sets vbv buffer size; typically double the bitrate for smooth rate control.\n- Audio: encode with AAC at 128 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart` for web streaming optimization.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i raw_footage.mxf -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -minrate 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis will produce an MP4 with video bitrate tightly controlled at ~5000 kbps in VBR mode.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command that it generated seems logically constructed to meet the user's requirement of locking the bitrate to exactly 5000 kbps using VBR settings. It includes appropriate parameters such as `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`, which are all correctly utilized.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and does not contain any clearly incorrect parameters or syntax like the example.\n\n3) The command generated by the model follows the requirements detailed in the FFmpeg man page. All options are applied correctly, and the order of options is appropriate according to the syntax rules provided. Parameters like `-b:v`, `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` are all recognized and used correctly based on the context.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation."
