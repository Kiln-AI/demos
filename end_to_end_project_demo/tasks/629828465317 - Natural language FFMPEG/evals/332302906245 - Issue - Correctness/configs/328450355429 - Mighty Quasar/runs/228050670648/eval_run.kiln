  "output": "To convert file.mp4 to WebM format with VP8 codec using the very slow preset for maximum compression efficiency.\n\nUsing libvpx for VP8 encoding with -preset veryslow (VP8's \"cpu-used\" is inverted: lower values are slower/better compression). WebM uses VP8 for video and Opus/Vorbis for audio. I'm using libvorbis for audio as it's more universally compatible in WebM containers.\n\n- c:v libvpx specifies VP8 encoding\n- -preset veryslow maps to -cpu-used 0 for the slowest/best compression\n- b:v 1M provides target bitrate - adjust based on your quality needs (higher = better quality)\n- c:a libvorbis uses Vorbis audio codec compatible with WebM\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i file.mp4 -c:v libvpx -preset veryslow -b:v 1M -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does *not* contain the issue described in the issue description. The command produced effectively meets the user's request to convert the file to WebM format using the VP8 codec with the veryslow preset.\n\n2) The model's output is *not* similar to the example of a failing output. The preset \"veryslow\" is correctly identified and used according to the context of the VP8 codec. Therefore, the command is not using an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies options, including the input file, video codec, preset, bitrate, and audio codec, in the appropriate format and order.\n\n4) Based on the analysis provided, the model's output does not contain any issues and effectively fulfills the user's request. It correctly constructs the ffmpeg command without violating any syntax or options restrictions.\n\nTherefore, I would conclude that the model's output passes the evaluation."
