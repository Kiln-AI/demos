  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video with `ffmpeg`, use the `deshake` filter, which corrects the stabilization of shaky video by setting the base position (with `base`) and motion compensated frame movement to the reference object (with `rect`). Here’s a typical command for deshaking a video. However, you may have slight variations based on your video's requirements or specifics about its shaky nature:\n\n- `deshake base` adjusts the base input to match a reference object's position effectively.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshape=base output_stableded.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**: \n\n1.  The shaky video has reasonable stability, so you're using `base` as your reference. If your video is extremely jittery or unpredictable (`super-jittery`), consider the `haze` or `trackpoint` filter:\n    *   For `super-jittery` videos, you might want `haze` instead of `base`, effectively smoothening out the shaky video. This option can give a less sharp correction result than `base`, but is suitable for extremely shaky footage.\n\n    ```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf haze output_smooth.mp4\n```\n\n    *   `trackpoint` filters require manually identifying clear points in the video – e.g., moving objects – to enable stabilization over time, which requires more manual analysis and may require taking the footage from the point of view that you know will be stable during the scene; you also know that you will have at least two points a second.\n\n2.  The input is `.mp4`. For files in `.avi`, you should use `-i input.avi`.\n3.  This assumes a smooth reference (`base`). If you have images or text, or sometimes animated objects (`rect` filter in combination with others), you will need more assistance setting the image that you wish to reference (`rect`, usually in the form: `\"x:y`\").\n\nHowever, `deshake` requires the original video with high detail, ideally clean of significant motion with regard to background movement, otherwise it is very difficult for this filter to decide on a valid stabilizer and produces unpleasant results.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue. The command it generated has a typo: it used `deshape` instead of the correct `deshake`. This would lead to the command failing when executed since `deshape` is not a recognized filter in FFmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the example of a failing output because it contains a broken command that will not execute properly due to an error in the filter name. Although it is not the exact same as the provided failure example (which uses an incorrect preset), it does have the same underlying problem of producing a command that won't work as expected.\n\n3) The command breaks a requirement dictated in the man page, specifically the accurate naming of filters and options. The use of `deshape` is incorrect. Proper usage of filters is fundamental to successful FFmpeg command execution.\n\n4) Given the issues identified in points 1, 2, and 3, I would conclude that the model's output fails to adequately fulfill the task requirements as it generates a command that would not work correctly due to the typo in the filter name."
