  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using the `deshake` filter in ffmpeg, you can apply it as a video filter. Note that the `deshake` filter works best on videos with mild to moderate shakiness and applies a simple motion compensation algorithm.\n\nHere's the command applying `deshake` to `bumpy_ride.mp4`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake -c:a copy stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf deshake` applies the deshake filter to reduce shakiness.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- The output file is named `stabilized_bumpy_ride.mp4`.\n\nIf you want finer control, you can adjust parameters like `rx` and `ry` (max horizontal and vertical shift), `edge` (how edges are handled), but the above uses default settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the prompt. The generated ffmpeg command correctly utilizes the `deshake` filter to stabilize the video and follows the syntax rules of the ffmpeg command line. Therefore, it meets the user's request for stabilizing the video `bumpy_ride.mp4`.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model uses valid options and compliant syntax. The preset `extra_fast` mentioned in the failure example is not applicable here, and the command correctly employs the `deshake` filter without using any non-existent options or presets.\n\n3) According to the ffmpeg man page, the command given by the model follows the proper structure and does not break any requirements. The filter `-vf deshake` is a valid video filter option. The command structure, where options are applied to the specified input file and then to the output file, is followed correctly.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command works correctly, matches the requirements from the user, and adheres to the rules of ffmpeg. Thus, the model's performance on this task is satisfactory."
