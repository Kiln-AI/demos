  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of the input file `broadcast.ts` and combine them into a single output file, you need to specify the input streams using the `-map` option. This ensures that only the desired streams are selected and combined in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:10` selects the 10th video stream from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:18` selects the 18th audio stream from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding, preserving the original quality and format.\n- `-f mp4` specifies the output format as MP4, which is a common container format for video and audio.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- The input file `broadcast.ts` contains at least 10 video streams and 18 audio streams.\n- You want to copy the streams without re-encoding to maintain original quality and ensure compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly extracts the specified video and audio streams from the `broadcast.ts` file without any apparent errors, matching the requirements set by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any mistakes such as using an invalid preset or option. Instead, it uses valid and appropriate `ffmpeg` commands.\n\n3) The command does comply with the requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The mapping of streams using `-map 0:v:10` and `-map 0:a:18` is correctly utilized, and the use of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` ensures that streams are copied without re-encoding, preserving their quality.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command is correct and fulfills the user's request, which means it should pass this evaluation."
