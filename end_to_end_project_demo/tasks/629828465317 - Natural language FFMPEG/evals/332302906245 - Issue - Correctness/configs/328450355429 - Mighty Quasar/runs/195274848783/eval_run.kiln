  "output": "To convert a 4K video into a 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset, and copy the audio stream without re-encoding, use the following approach:\n\n- vf scale=-2:1080 resizes the video to 1080 height while maintaining the aspect ratio of the original (assuming you want to maintain aspect ratio). -2 ensures the height is divisible by 2 (libx264 requirement for yuv420p).\n- c:v libx264 uses H.264 video encoding.\n- preset veryslow focuses on the best compression efficiency at the cost of slower encoding speed.\n- crf 18 sets quality (lower is better; 18 is a good compromise for a high-quality source).\n- c:a copy specifies that the audio stream should be copied without re-encoding.\n- pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility with older browsers/devices.\n- movflags +faststart places metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -crf 18 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Input file name is `input.mp4`, replace with your file name.\n- The input video contains a compatible audio codec that doesn't need re-encoding. If the audio codec isn't compatible or is corrupted, re-encoding with AAC audio using `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` can be done instead of copying.\n- A two-pass encoding might be beneficial if the bitrate needs to be constrained, however, the approach above uses a single pass.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command generated by the model accurately reflects the user's request to convert a 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset and to copy the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given, as the command generated is valid and uses available options correctly. The preset `veryslow` does exist, and all the other parameters used in this command follow valid ffmpeg syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All the options used (`-vf scale=-2:1080`, `-c:v libx264`, `-preset veryslow`, `-crf 18`, `-c:a copy`, `-pix_fmt yuv420p`, and `-movflags +faststart`) are valid and operate within the rules specified in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and it should pass as the generated ffmpeg command is valid and aligned with the user's requirements."
