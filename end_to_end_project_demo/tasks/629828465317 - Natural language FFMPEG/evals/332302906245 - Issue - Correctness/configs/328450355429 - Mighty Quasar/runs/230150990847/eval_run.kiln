  "input": "Convert my MOV file to WebM format using the libx264 codec for online video",
  "output": "The MOV file format typically uses codecs like ProRes or H.264, but WebM is a container format that natively supports VP8/VP9 for video and Vorbis for audio. Using **libx264** (H.264) with WebM is not standard, as H.264 is not supported in the WebM container. For compatibility, you should use **libvpx** (VP9) or **libvpx-vp8** (VP8) for video and **libvorbis** for audio. If you specifically need H.264, consider using MP4 instead. Here’s the correct command for WebM:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libvpx -c:a libvorbis output.webm\n```\n\n**Explanation:**  \n- `-c:v libvpx` encodes video using VP9 (or VP8 if you specify `libvpx-vp8` for older compatibility).  \n- `-c:a libvorbis` encodes audio using Vorbis, which is standard for WebM.  \n- This ensures the output is a valid WebM file suitable for online streaming.  \n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Your input file contains compatible audio/video streams for WebM.  \n- You are okay with VP9/VP8 video and Vorbis audio (no additional parameters for quality/bitrate provided; adjust as needed).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue as it suggested using the `libx264` codec with the WebM format. H.264 is not supported in the WebM container; instead, WebM typically utilizes the `libvpx` codec for video. This means that the command provided will not execute successfully because it violates the format requirements of WebM.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example in that it suggests an invalid codec option for the specified output format. The command would fail when executed.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does break the requirements dictated in the man page regarding codec support for the specified container format. It incorrectly attempts to use `libx264` (H.264) with a WebM output, which is against the expected usage for that format.\n\nOverall, the model's output contains a significant error as it incorporates an unsupported codec for the requested output format. Therefore, it fails to meet the user’s requirements appropriately."
