  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from the source file `complex.avi`, you can use the `-map` option followed by the stream number(s) you want to map.\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command:\n```\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:3 output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `-map 0:v:2` maps the second video stream (`v:2`) from the source file. The `0:v` specifies the video stream, and `2` specifies the stream number.\n* `-map 0:a:3` maps the fourth audio stream (`a:3`) from the source file. The `0:a` specifies the audio stream, and `3` specifies the stream number.\n\nBy mapping these streams, the second video stream and fourth audio stream will be extracted from the source file and written to the output file `output.mp4`.\n\nNote that I assumed you want to keep the video and audio streams intact, without modifying their codecs, resolutions, or other settings. If you need to perform any further processing or modifications on the streams, you can add additional options to the `-map` specification.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the specified streams from the input file as per the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain an invalid option or an incorrect parameter. It correctly specifies the streams with the `-map` options, which follows the expected syntax in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. The `-map` options used in the command conform to the expected usage outlined in the documentation for selecting input streams.\n\nOverall, the model's output is accurate and satisfies the user's request appropriately, without any errors in the command syntax or logic. The evaluation passes."
