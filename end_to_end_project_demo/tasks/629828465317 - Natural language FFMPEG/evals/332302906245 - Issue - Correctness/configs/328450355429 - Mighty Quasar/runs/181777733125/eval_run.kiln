  "output": "To extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 and combine them into a single output, use the `-map` option to select specific streams from the input. The map syntax uses zero-based indexing: `-map 0:10` selects the 11th stream from the first input file (input 0), and `-map 0:18` selects the 19th stream. I'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding and preserve quality, assuming both streams are already in compatible formats.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated appears to be valid, correctly utilizing the `-map` feature of ffmpeg to extract specified streams from the input file and combining them into an output file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. In the output, the command correctly identifies and maps the input streams, which is not an error similar to using an incorrect or nonexistent option like `-preset extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map` is valid and correctly follows the input and output specifications. Moreover, the `-c copy` command indicates that the streams will be copied without re-encoding, which is appropriate under the circumstances.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is correct and should work as intended to extract and combine the specified streams without any problems. It meets the user's request effectively. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
