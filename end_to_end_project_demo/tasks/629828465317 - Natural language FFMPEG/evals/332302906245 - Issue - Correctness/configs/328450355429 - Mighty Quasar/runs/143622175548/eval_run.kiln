  "input": "I need to convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder with 48kHz sample rate",
  "output": "To convert audio.ogg to WAV format using the vorbis decoder and specify a 48kHz sample rate, you can use the following command:\n\n- -i audio.ogg specifies the input file.\n- -c:a pcm_s16le uses 16-bit little-endian PCM, which is common for WAV.\n- -ar 48000 sets the audio sample rate to 48 kHz.\n- Output will be in WAV format by default with specified parameters.\n\nThis will convert the Vorbis audio in audio.ogg to a 48kHz WAV file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -c:a pcm_s16le -ar 48000 audio.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain an issue as per the description given. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i audio.ogg -c:a pcm_s16le -ar 48000 audio.wav`) correctly follows the user's instruction to convert an OGG audio file to WAV format using the Vorbis decoder with a specified sample rate of 48kHz, and it uses appropriate FFmpeg options.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced is correct and uses valid options and parameters according to FFmpeg's capabilities.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to the requirements outlined in the FFmpeg man page. The parameters -c:a for specifying the audio codec and -ar for setting the sample rate are correctly applied, and the overall command structure is compliant with the syntax described in the documentation.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\nThe model's output does not contain the issues described, and it successfully generates a command that meets the task's requirements. Therefore, the evaluation concludes that this output is correct and performs as expected."
