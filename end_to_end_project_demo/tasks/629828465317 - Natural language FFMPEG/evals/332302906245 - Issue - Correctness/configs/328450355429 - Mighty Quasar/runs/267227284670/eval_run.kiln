  "input": "Convert my 4K video to 1080p MP4 using the veryslow preset and copy the audio stream without re-encoding",
  "output": " The `.ts` (transport stream) format is used for streaming media, particularly for video broadcasts. When converting to `.mp4` for web use, it's possible to perform the same operations but result in a standard `.mp4` container. Here's the equivalent ffmpeg command for these requirements:\n\n- Convert the video to 1080p (720 height) while maintaining aspect ratio.\n- Use the veryslow preset for the H.264 encoder, which gives higher compression but lower encoding speed, suitable for situations where encoding speed is less of a concern.\n- Copy the audio stream without re-encoding it (preserve_timestamps option forces the original timestamps), assuming the audio file was originally correct and only needs to be part of the new container without modification.\n- Keep the MaxTemporalSearchRange low to simplify PS and SCR information, which will look simpler in container and is often acceptable for many use cases when motion is not complex.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -pass 1 -c:v libx264 -preset veryslow -tune stillimage -max_mbtu 0 -maxrate 0 -bufsize 6M -g 48 -rc const -an -an -scodec copy -c:a copy -pass 2 -f mp4 pass.ts\n```\n\nIn the above command:\n\n- `-i input.mp4` specifies the input file.\n- `-pass` increments the pass number; the first pass (1) generates BPACK and MPB file required for generating the keyframe offset (used for seeking within the stream in streaming setups).\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264.\n- `-preset veryslow` sets the encoding preset to 'veryslow' to maximize compression at the cost of encoding speed.\n- `-tune stillimage` forces still image encoding to simplify burn-in metadata, which could affect compatibility on some devices/formats.\n- `-max_mbtu 0` disables multiblock transform unit (MBU) and eliminates most of the H.264 advanced features for speed.\n- `-maxrate 0` and `-bufsize 6M` help in reducing the bandwidth of MP4 by limiting the encoding process.\n- `-g 48` and `-rc const` set the GOP (Group of Pictures) structure (every 48 frames a keyframe is inserted) and refererence count, respectively.\n- `-an` commands ffmpeg to disable audio recording use `-an -an` outside the first pass to stop all audio and copy the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-scodec copy` removes codec information from the video stream during the first pass.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-f mp4` specifies the output format to MPEG-4 Part 14 - Audio Visual Base Media File Format.\n\nAfter the first pass (creating pass.ts), you might want to compile the main MP4 file using a command like this:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -y -f mp4 -i pass.ts -c:v copy -c:a copy -metadata :BPS=\"0\" -metadata :BPS=\"0\" -metadata :DURATION=\"149.000000\" -metadata :TIME_BASE=\"1000000\" -template copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command takes pass.ts as input and creates an MP4 file with the same video and audio streams without re-encoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues as it does not generate a correct ffmpeg command. The command includes the wrong options, such as `-pass`, `-tune stillimage`, `-max_mbtu`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize`, none of which are relevant for the user's request for a simple 4K to 1080p conversion with audio copying. Additionally, the output format is set to `.ts`, while the user requests an `.mp4` file. The audio copying command is correct, but is surrounded by incorrect flags.\n\n2) The model’s output is similar to the failing example. It uses the `-pass` option in an unnecessary way, includes a reference to `-tune stillimage` that is not relevant to the user’s request, and specifies a `.ts` output instead of `.mp4`. This deviation from the user's request pointing to unnecessary and irrelevant configuration makes it inherently flawed.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break several requirements as dictated in the man page. The use of `-pass` is incorrect since the task does not require two-pass encoding. Additional options such as `-tune stillimage`, `-max_mbtu`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` are unnecessary and do not align with the user's specifications. The output format is also incorrectly specified as `.ts` instead of `.mp4`, contradicting the user’s request.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output fails to meet the requirements described, as it contains incorrect command structure and extraneous options, rendering it unusable for the specified task of converting a 4K video to 1080p MP4 with audio copying."
