  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a MKV file and save them as an MP4, you need to map the desired streams using `-map` and re-encode them into MP4-compatible codecs (H.264 for video and AAC for audio). The stream indices are zero-based, so `0:4` refers to the 5th video stream, and `0:9` refers to the 10th audio stream. This assumes the input file contains at least 10 audio streams and 5 video streams (indexing starts at 0).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:v:4 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac trimmed.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `-map 0:v:4`: Selects the 5th video stream (zero-based index).\n- `-map 0:a:9`: Selects the 10th audio stream (zero-based index).\n- `-c:v libx264`: Encodes video using H.264 (standard for MP4 compatibility).\n- `-c:a aac`: Encodes audio using AAC (standard for MP4 compatibility).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for the user's request, correctly maps the specified video and audio streams, and utilizes compatible codecs for the MP4 output.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command produced by the model is valid and does not use a non-existent option or parameter, as demonstrated in the failure example.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input and output file, utilizes valid options like `-map` for stream selection, and applies the necessary codecs for the output format. There are no violations of the command syntax or usage as per the guidelines.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and therefore it should pass the evaluation. The command is correctly structured, achieves the user's request, and is in line with the specifications from the FFmpeg documentation."
