  "input": "I need to extract audio track 5 from my video file input.mov and combine it with the video from the same file. Can you help me map the streams correctly?",
  "output": "To extract a specific audio stream (stream 5) from a video file and combine it with the original video stream, you can use stream mapping in ffmpeg. This allows you to select particular streams and keep them without re-encoding if possible.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original video stream and replace the audio with stream 5, you can map the video stream directly and specify the desired audio stream. If re-encoding is acceptable, it simplifies the process and ensures compatibility.\n\nHere's the approach:\n- -map 0:v:0 to select the video stream.\n- -map 0:a:5 to select the audio stream 5.\n- -c:v copy to copy the video stream without re-encoding.\n- -c:a copy to copy the audio stream without re-encoding (if supported). If the audio stream needs re-encoding for compatibility, specify a codec like aac.\n\nAssuming no re-encoding needed:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis command takes the video stream 0 (the first video stream) and audio stream 5 from input.mov and creates output.mov with these streams.\n\n**Note:** Ensure that stream 5 exists in your input file; you can check with `ffmpeg -i input.mov` to verify stream indices.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mov`) is correctly formatted and adheres to the user's request for extracting audio track 5 from the video file and combining it with the video stream, along with the proper stream mapping syntax.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated does not contain any invalid parameters or misused options. The `-map` and `-c` options are correctly used and are valid within the context of the ffmpeg command. There are no nonexistent presets or commands given.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct structure for mapping input streams, properly uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to indicate that these streams should be copied without re-encoding, and the logic aligns with the ffmpeg documentation regarding stream mapping.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is correct for the given task and adequately matches the requirements of the user without any issues. It effectively conveys the appropriate command while explaining the relevant parameters. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation successfully."
