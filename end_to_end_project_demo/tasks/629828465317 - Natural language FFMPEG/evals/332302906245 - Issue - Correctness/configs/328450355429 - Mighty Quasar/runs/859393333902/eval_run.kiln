  "input": "Convert my video `input.mov` to `output.mp4` using a constant quality setting of -5. I need the absolute best quality possible.",
  "output": "To achieve the absolute best quality when converting `input.mov` to `output.mp4`, use libx264 with a CRF (Constant Rate Factor) of 5, which is extremely high quality (lower CRF values improve quality but increase file size). The `-preset slow` optimizes compression efficiency for quality. Audio is encoded with AAC at 256kbps (higher than default for better fidelity). Ensure `yuv420p` pixel format for cross-platform compatibility and add `-movflags +faststart` for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 5 -c:a aac -b:a 256k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:\n1. The input does not require resizing or aspect ratio adjustment (no scaling applied).\n2. You intended a CRF value of `5` rather than `-5`, as negative CRF values are invalid in FFmpeg (CRF ranges from 0 to 51, where 0 is lossless).\n3. Audio is stereo and AAC-compatible (FFmpeg will handle downmixing if necessary). For stricter compatibility, you could add `-ac 2` to ensure stereo output.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issues described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly follows the user's request to convert `input.mov` to `output.mp4` using a CRF value that represents a high-quality encoding setting. All parameters appear to be set correctly according to FFmpeg usage.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The generated command uses valid options and parameters according to the FFmpeg man page, while the given failure example uses an invalid preset option (`extra_fast`). Thus, this command does not exhibit a similar critical failure.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options utilized (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, `-crf`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, `-pix_fmt`, and `-movflags`) are all valid and correctly applied, maintaining proper order and functionality as stipulated in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Overall, I would conclude that the model's output does **not** contain the issues described in the evaluation criteria. Therefore, the output should pass the evaluation."
