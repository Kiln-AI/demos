This ensures the best audio quality in MP3 format.\n\n- -q:a 0 sets the highest quality VBR for MP3, or alternatively, -b:a 320k can be used for constant bitrate.\n- -vn disables video recording (extract audio only).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be correct and meets the user's request, which is to extract audio from a video file and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command `ffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3` uses valid options and parameters according to the ffmpeg documentation. There are no mistakes such as using non-existent presets or invalid options.\n\n3) Reviewing the ffmpeg command against the man page shows that it adheres to the requirements outlined there. All options used in the command are valid:\n   - `-i video.mkv` specifies the input file correctly.\n   - `-vn` disables video recording, which is appropriate for audio extraction.\n   - `-c:a libmp3lame` specifies using the LAME MP3 encoder which is valid for creating MP3 files.\n   - `-b:a 320k` sets audio bitrate to 320 kbps, which is indeed the maximum bitrate for MP3.\n   - `output.mp3` designates a valid output file name and format.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and passes the evaluation."
