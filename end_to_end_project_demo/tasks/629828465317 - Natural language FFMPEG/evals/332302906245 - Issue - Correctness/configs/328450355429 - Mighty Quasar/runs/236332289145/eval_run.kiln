  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply strong noise reduction, the `rotate` filter is used for the rotation, and the `nlmeans` filter is employed for advanced noise reduction. The `nlmeans` parameters are adjusted to maximize noise suppression while balancing quality. The `patchsize` and `searcharea` are increased to cover more pixels for stronger reduction, and `strength` is set to 0.9 for aggressive noise filtering. Audio is preserved using the default codec, though you may adjust it if specific requirements exist.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90, nlmeans=patchsize=32:searcharea=64:strength=0.9\" output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"rotate=90, nlmeans=patchsize=32:searcharea=64:strength=0.9\" output.mp4`) is a valid `ffmpeg` command that accurately reflects the requirements provided by the user â€” rotating the video by 90 degrees clockwise and applying noise reduction. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated does not include any invalid options or parameters, unlike the example with `-preset extra_fast`, which is an invalid option. \n\n3) Consulting the `ffmpeg` man page, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated. The options used (`-vf`, `rotate`, and `nlmeans`) are valid, as well as the parameters provided for `nlmeans`. Furthermore, preserving audio by using the default codec is an acceptable approach when no explicit audio settings are necessary. \n\nBased on this assessment:\n- The model's output does not contain issues described.\n- The output is not similar to the failure example.\n- The command does not break any requirements stated in the man page. \n\nTherefore, I conclude that the model has performed correctly in generating a proper `ffmpeg` command for the user's request."
