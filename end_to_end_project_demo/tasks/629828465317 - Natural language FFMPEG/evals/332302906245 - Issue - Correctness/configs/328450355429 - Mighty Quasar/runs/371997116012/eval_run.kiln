  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream from a multi-stream input file (movie.mkv) and save them into a new MP4 file (final.mp4), you can specify stream selection by stream specifiers:\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (indexing starts at 0).\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies the selected streams without re-encoding to preserve quality and speed up processing.\n- Since MP4 containers may have limited support depending on codecs, this approach assumes the video and audio codecs of the extracted streams are compatible with MP4. If not, re-encoding might be necessary, but here we copy for efficiency.\n- Ensure the output container supports the codecs used in the streams.\n\nIf stream type or codec compatibility becomes an issue, one might need to re-encode or remux accordingly.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the described issue. The FFmpeg command provided correctly extracts the first video stream and the third audio stream from the input file `movie.mkv` and saves them into `final.mp4`, matching the user's request. The command is logically coherent and the required stream specifiers and formats are appropriately handled.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command generated by the model is accurate and does not contain any nonexistent options or mistakes as seen in the failure example (`-preset extra_fast`), which uses an invalid preset. The command correctly specifies valid options for stream mapping and copying.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It properly uses the `-map` option for selecting streams, maintains the correct order of options, and uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` as per the guidelines without introducing any incompatible options. All components of the command are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described, as it correctly fulfills the user's request and adheres to FFmpeg's requirements. Therefore, it should be evaluated as passing."
