  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated correctly maps the first video stream and the specified third audio stream from the input file `movie.mkv` to the output file `final.mp4` while using `-c copy` to maintain the streams without re-encoding. This command matches the user requirements effectively.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The output command is well-formed and correctly utilizes the `-map` functionality specific to the user's request. There are no non-existent parameters or misplaced options, unlike the failure_example provided.\n\n3) According to the `ffmpeg` man page and the command structure outlined, the model's output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page. The usage of `-map` for selecting input streams and `-c copy` for copying without re-encoding is valid, and the order of options is consistent with the expected usage of `ffmpeg`.\n\nOverall, the model's output successfully meets the user's request by producing a valid command, therefore, it should be deemed successful."
