  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 in input recording.mov into a single MP4 file, you can use stream selection with the `-map` option. This way, you explicitly select the desired video and audio streams without re-encoding if codecs are compatible, or you can specify re-encoding if necessary.\n\nAssuming we want to keep a standard MP4 encoding suitable for most players, we’ll explicitly select streams and re-encode if necessary. Here's a command to do that:\n\n- `-map 0:2` selects the third stream from the first input (stream index starts at 0).\n- `-map 1:3` selects the fourth stream from the second input.\n- Using `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` to encode video and audio into MP4-compatible codecs.\n- `-preset fast` for a balance between encoding speed and compression.\n- `-crf 23` as a good default quality setting.\n- `-movflags +faststart` to optimize the MP4 for streaming.\n\nIf the streams are from different inputs, you must specify inputs accordingly (e.g., input1 and input2).\n\nHere’s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -i recording.mov -map 1:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nOr, more simply (since both streams are from the same file, but ffmpeg needs multiple inputs for separate mappings), you can do:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- Both streams are from the same file (recording.mov). `-map 0:2` selects video stream 2, and `-map 0:3` selects audio stream 3 respectively.\n- No `-i` given a second input, so do this with a single input.\n- This approach avoids the need for multiple inputs.\n\nThis will produce an `output.mp4` file combining the desired video and audio streams into a compatible player-friendly container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly combines the specified video and audio streams from the input file into a single MP4 output file without any syntax errors or invalid commands.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output because it generates a valid ffmpeg command that utilizes the correct `-map` option for selecting the streams.\n\n3) The command produced by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options are properly applied to the input and output files, and the usage of `-map` for stream selection is consistent with the documentation.\n\n4) There are no issues with the model's output as it does contain a valid command. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation, as it accurately reflects the user's request for combining specific video and audio streams without any errors or incorrect parameters."
