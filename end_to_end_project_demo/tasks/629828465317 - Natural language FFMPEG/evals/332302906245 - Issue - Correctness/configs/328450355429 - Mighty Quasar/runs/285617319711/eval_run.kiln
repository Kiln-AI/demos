  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds as PNG images, use the ffmpeg select filter to grab one frame from every 2-second interval, then use PNG compression with the highest quality settings.\n\nI'm assuming:\n- \"ultra high resolution\" means to not downscale the original – PNG losslessly preserves source resolution\n- You want the output images sequentially numbered in the current directory\n- Using frame rate (fps filter) would not give exact 2-second intervals (due to rounding), so we'll use select filter with a precise expression\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"select='not(mod(n,2*fps))'\" -vsync 0 -start_number 0 -q:v 1 frame_%05d.png\n```\n\n• `select='not(mod(n,2*fps))'` selects only frames where the frame index (n) is a multiple of 2 × fps – effectively once every 2 seconds regardless of variable frame rate\n• `-vsync 0` prevents ffmpeg from duplicating or dropping frames when generating the output image sequence\n• `-q:v 1` sets the PNG compression level to max quality (0=best, 9=smallest)  \n• `frame_%05d.png` names the files frame_00000.png, frame_00001.png…",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly uses parameters that match the user's requirements of extracting frames from a video every 2 seconds and saving them as PNG images. The explanation provided clarifies the assumptions and reasoning behind the choices made in the command.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command produced by the model does not use any invalid or non-existent options. All components are valid and applicable to the task at hand.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of the select filter and the associated parameters follows the syntax expected by ffmpeg for frame extraction processes.\n\n4) Given that the output is accurate, doesn't contain invalid commands, and adheres to the man page specifications, the model's output passes."
