  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream input and include them in the output, you can use the `-map` option twice: once for the video stream and once for the audio stream. Here, you want to map video stream index 6 and audio stream index 9 (these indexes are zero-based, referring to the streams in the input file). \n\nAssuming your input file is named `input.ext`, the command will look like:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.ext -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:6` picks the 7th video stream (index 6) from input 0.\n- `-map 0:a:9` picks the 10th audio stream (index 9) from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- Replace `input.ext` with your actual input filename.\n\nIf your stream indices are absolute stream numbers rather than separate video and audio indices, use `-map 0:6` and `-map 0:9` instead. Please clarify if needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream input to create an output file. The syntax used is correct, and it accurately follows the `ffmpeg` mapping conventions.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the given failure example. The command it produced is structured correctly and does not contain any known incorrect options, like a non-existent preset or invalid syntax.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does **not break any requirements** dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid options and follows the correct syntax for mapping streams (`-map 0:v:6` and `-map 0:a:9`) and copying streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`).\n\n4) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described and should therefore be marked as passing. It accurately addresses the user's request without any errors or invalid commands."
