  "output": "To convert `input.flv` to MP4 using the x264 video codec and AAC audio at 320 kbps, ensure compatibility with most devices by using the yuv420p pixel format. The command assumes you want to retain the original video resolution and quality unless specified otherwise. If you need further adjustments (e.g., bitrate, resolution, or encoding speed), additional parameters can be added.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.flv -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 320k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-c:v libx264`: Specifies the H.264 video codec (x264).\n- `-c:a aac`: Uses AAC audio codec for MP4 compatibility.\n- `-b:a 320k`: Sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures broad compatibility with players and devices.\n- No explicit resolution scaling is applied, as the user did not specify it. Adjust with `-vf scale=width:height` if needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriately structured and matches the requirements provided by the user. It specifies the input and output files, as well as the necessary codecs and audio bitrate, all accurately reflecting the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is correct and does not contain any errors such as using a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All specified options in the command are valid and follow the correct structure as outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Given that the model's output passes all evaluation criteria, it correctly implements the user-requested ffmpeg command. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
