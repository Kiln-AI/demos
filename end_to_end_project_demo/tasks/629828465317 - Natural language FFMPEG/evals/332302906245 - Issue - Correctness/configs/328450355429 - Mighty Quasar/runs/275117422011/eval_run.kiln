  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles to the video file and simultaneously remove all existing subtitle tracks, you need to identify the subtitle track(s) and then remux the output file with the new subtitle track. A common issue with FFmpeg ensues that it'll only remove subtitles if they are different from the ones you are adding. You need to output the intermediate file that you will then remux to add the subtitles and eliminate the old subtitle tracks.\n\nAssuming you're adding English subtitles in vtt format named `subtitles.srt`, and the original subtitles aren't in the srt format, you'd first extract them to srt, then remux the output file to include the new srt and remove the old ones.\n\nHere's an example for an intermediate step. I'm assuming there is no audio in the subtitles track, since it's not super common for audio to be included. The original conversion command for the first part is not provided, so we'll include a scale-to-720p operation similar to the earlier example, assuming the video does not already support subtitles:\n\n1. Extract and convert existing subtitles to srt (this requires there to be an existing subtitle track in .srt or an .ass/.ssa/ .vtt, etc. which can be easily converted).\n\n2. Remux the video with the converted subtitles, ensuring only the newly converted subtitles are retained:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\nffmpeg -i output.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt -map 0 -c:a copy -c:s mov_text -bsf:v:kaldi text_metadata final.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf subtitles=subtitles.srt -map 0 -c:a copy -c:s mov_text`: This FFmpeg command adds the subtitles and converts the subtitle component to mov_text, which is a text-based container format, and copies the audio without re-encoding.\n- `-bsf:v:kaldi text_metadata`: Applies the Kaldi Text Metadata fragment stream filter for .mov containers, keeping the text track metadata.\n\nNote: This is assuming there are no audio elements in the subtitle files, and that your `subtitles.srt` is in a format that FFmpeg can recognize as an SRT, ASS/SSA, or VTT. If there is audio in the subtitle track, you might need a more advanced trick for manipulation because most subtitle tracks are expected to be plain text, not audio.\n\nHowever, the above solution lacks precise instructions for changing the subtitle displays and assumes the removal of other languages without specifying the languages present. You'd need the exact formats of the extra subtitles before proceeding with their removal. If specific languages are known, their tracks should be remuxed separately with the kept text subtrack, else you might have to strip them one by one using ffmpeg's `-map:v` and `-map:a -1` parameter combination (which unmaps all audio streams except the first).\n\nFor a sophisticated setup, you might also consider two-pass encoding which is outside the scope of this basic solution. Always back up your original file before testing remuxing operations to prevent accidental data loss.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue. The command it generated does not directly address the user's request to remove all existing subtitle tracks while adding new ones. Instead, it suggests an intermediate step involving the extraction and conversion of the existing subtitles, which complicates the process unnecessarily and does not provide a clear command for removing old subtitles.\n\n2) Yes, the model's output is similar to the example of a failing output. While the commands generated are technically structured correctly, they do not accurately fulfill the user's request. The presence of an unnecessary step adds confusion, making it effectively a failure.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break the requirements dictated in the man page. The assumption that it needs to extract existing subtitles before adding new ones is not dictated as a necessity in the man page. Additionally, the command implies a process for managing subtitles in a way that could lead to complications not discussed in the user query.\n\nOverall, the model's output contains significant issues as it does not correctly handle the user's request to remove existing subtitle tracks while adding new ones, leading to a failure in providing a useful ffmpeg command."
