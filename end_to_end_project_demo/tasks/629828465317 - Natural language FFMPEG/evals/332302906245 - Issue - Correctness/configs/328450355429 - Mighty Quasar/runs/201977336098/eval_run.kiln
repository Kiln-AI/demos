  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To select only the third audio stream and keep the original video:\n\n- -map 0:v:0 chooses the first video stream from the input (assuming you have a single video stream; adjust if otherwise).\n- -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream (streams count from zero).\n- -c:v copy copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- -c:a copy copies the audio stream as-is.\n\nThis will produce an output with the original video and only the third audio track.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- \"Third audio stream\" means stream index 2 (since counting starts from 0).\n- There's only one video stream, and you wish to keep it without re-encoding.\n- Output is MKV to maintain maximum compatibility with multiple audio streams.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated seems correct and matches the user's requirements for mapping the desired audio stream while keeping the original video. The explanation provided is also clear and accurate regarding the usage of parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv`) is valid, and there are no mistakes like attempting to use a non-existent preset or other erroneous options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The parameters used comply with the FFmpeg command specifications, and the syntax is correct. The mapping commands appropriately reference the input streams.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue, so it should be marked as passing."
