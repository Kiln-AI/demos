This option lets you select specific streams by their input stream index. \n\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream (stream 0:1 in 0-based numbering).\n- `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream (0:3), as per input file indexing.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding, preserving the original codec and quality.\n- The output is saved as result.mp4.\n\nAssuming that input.avi contains at least four streams and that stream 0:1 is video and 0:3 is audio, this command will create a MP4 container with the selected video and audio streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is appropriate for the user's request to extract specific video and audio streams using the correct syntax for the `ffmpeg` command. The model accurately explains the use of the `-map` option and includes the necessary command to accomplish the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated correctly uses the `-map` options and `-c copy` without any syntax errors or incorrect parameters. The example of a failing output shows a command with a non-existent preset, while the model's output is valid and functions as intended.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It correctly follows the syntax and conventions laid out in the documentation, as it specifies the input file, uses the `-map` options correctly to select the desired streams, and uses `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding. There are no violations of order or option requirements.\n\n4) Given the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issues described. It correctly addresses the userâ€™s request with a valid `ffmpeg` command, so it passes the evaluation criteria."
