  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to add subtitles to their video and remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time. Let me think about how to approach this with FFmpeg.\n\nFirst, removing existing subtitles. FFmpeg doesn't have a direct option to remove all subtitle tracks, but I remember that you can use the -map option to specify which streams to include. So if the video has multiple subtitle tracks, I can map only the video and audio streams, effectively ignoring the subtitles. But I need to make sure that the input has subtitle streams. If there are no subtitles, this step won't do anything. But the user mentioned removing existing ones, so assuming they exist.\n\nNext, adding new subtitles. The user probably has a subtitle file, maybe .srt or .vtt. The command would need to include the subtitle file using the -i option and then map it. But how to ensure that the new subtitles are added without conflicting with the existing ones. Using -map 0 for the video and audio, and then -map 1 for the subtitle file. Wait, but the user wants to remove all existing subtitles, so they shouldn't be included in the output. So the mapping should be: video (0:v), audio (0:a), and the new subtitle (1:s). But the user might have multiple audio or video streams, so maybe using -map 0:v,0:a to include the video and audio, and then -map 1:s for the new subtitles. Also, the input might have multiple subtitle tracks, but the user wants to remove all, so the -map should exclude them.\n\nWait, the user might have multiple subtitle tracks. For example, if the original video has two subtitle tracks, the user wants to remove both. So, in the mapping, we can't include any subtitle tracks from the input. So the command would be: -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s, where 1 is the subtitle file. But if the user is providing the subtitle file as an input, then they need to specify it with -i. So the full command would have two inputs: the original video and the subtitle file.\n\nBut the user might not mention the subtitle file's name. So the command needs to have -i for the subtitle file. But the user's question is to add subtitles and remove existing ones. So the steps are:\n\n1. Remove existing subtitles: by not mapping any subtitle streams from the original video.\n2. Add new subtitles: by mapping the new subtitle file.\n\nSo the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nWait, but maybe the user wants to add the subtitles as a new track. Also, the original video's subtitle tracks are removed, and the new one is added. But the user might have multiple audio tracks as well. The -map 0:v selects the video stream, -map 0:a selects all audio streams, and -map 1:s selects the subtitle stream from the subtitle file. However, if the original video has multiple audio tracks, they would all be included. If the user wants to keep only one audio track, they might need to specify which one, but the user hasn't mentioned that. So I'll assume that they want all audio tracks from the original video, plus the new subtitles.\n\nAlso, the user might want to ensure that the subtitles are in a format compatible with the output. For example, if the output is MP4, using mov_text codec. So the command should include -c:s mov_text. Alternatively, if the output format supports other subtitle codecs, but MP4 typically uses mov_text or subtitles in a specific format.\n\nAnother consideration: the user might not have specified the subtitle file's location, so in the command, the subtitle file should be specified as a separate input. Also, the user might need to adjust the subtitle language or other parameters, but since they didn't mention that, I'll keep it simple.\n\nSo putting it all together, the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n\nBut wait, the user might not have specified the subtitle file's name, so the command should have a placeholder. Also, the user might need to adjust the codec. If the original subtitles are in a different format, like .ssa or .sub, the codec might need to be adjusted. But since the user didn't specify, using mov_text is a safe assumption for MP4.\n\nAnother thing: the user might want to remove all existing subtitles, which could be multiple tracks, so the -map 0:v and -map 0:a ensure that no subtitle tracks from the original are included. The -map 1:s adds the new subtitle track from the specified file.\n\nSo the final command would include the two inputs, map video and audio from the first input, map the subtitle from the second input, and set the subtitle codec. Also, the user might want to overwrite the output, which is handled by the output filename.\n\nI should also mention that the user needs to replace 'subtitles.srt' with their actual subtitle file path. Also, note that if the original video has multiple audio tracks, they'll all be included. If they want to select a specific audio track, they'd need to adjust the mapping accordingly, but that's beyond the current scope.\n</think>\n\nTo add subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks from the input video, you can use FFmpeg's `-map` option to explicitly include only the desired streams (video, audio, and the new subtitle), and exclude any existing subtitle tracks. This assumes your input file has at least one subtitle track to remove and that you have a separate subtitle file (e.g., `.srt`, `.vtt`) to add.\n\n### Key Parameters:\n- `-map 0:v` – Include the video stream from the first input (original video).\n- `-map 0:a` – Include all audio streams from the first input (original video).\n- `-map 1:s` – Include the subtitle stream from the second input (your `.srt`/`.vtt` file).\n- `-c:s mov_text` – Encode subtitles in MP4-compatible format (required for most containers like MP4).\n- `-i subtitles.srt` – Specify the external subtitle file (replace with your actual file).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\n### Notes:\n- Replace `subtitles.srt` with your actual subtitle file path.\n- If your input has multiple audio tracks, they will all be preserved. To select a specific audio track, use `-map 0:a:0` (e.g.) instead of `-map 0:a`.\n- If the input has no subtitle tracks, this command will still work (it simply ignores any non-existent subtitle streams).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Identification:** The model's output successfully generates a command to add subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks. The command uses the `-map` option appropriately to exclude the subtitle streams from the original video. Therefore, the output does not contain the issue described in the prompt regarding generating a command that works correctly and matches the requirements set by the user. **Result**: Pass.\n\n2) **Similarities to Failing Example:** The output generated by the model does not resemble the failure example provided. The command in the output is valid and correctly formats FFmpeg's command structure, whereas the failure example explicitly contains an invalid preset. The command produced is appropriate for the specified task and does not contain invalid options or parameters. **Result**: Pass.\n\n3) **Compliance with Man Page Requirements:** The command conforms to the structures and options detailed in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly employs multiple input files, applies necessary mapping without including unwanted subtitle tracks, and specifies a codec suitable for subtitles. Additionally, all mappings and options are correctly applied in line with the man page requirements. **Result**: Pass.\n\n4) **Overall Conclusion:** The model's output is accurate and satisfies the user's request without generating any erroneous commands or parameters. The use of `-map` to exclude existing subtitles and add the new subtitle track is a practical solution that aligns with the expected functionality of FFmpeg, implying that the command will work correctly if used with valid input files. Hence, I would classify the model's performance as successful."
