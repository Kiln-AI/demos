  "input": "I want to set the video bitrate to 10000000 and audio bitrate to 1000k for my streaming setup.",
  "output": "To set the video bitrate to 10 Mbps and audio bitrate to 1 Mbps for your streaming setup, you should use the following best practices:\n\n- `-b:v 10000000` sets the video bitrate to 10 Mbps.\n- `-b:a 1000k` sets the audio bitrate to 1 Mbps.\n- Use a suitable frame rate (e.g., 29.970 or 30 to match typical HD streaming rates).\n- Consider copying the codec if the format supports it for efficiency or re-encoding for maximum compatibility (specify the codec, e.g., `-c:v libx264`).\n- For streaming, the output container should be suitable (e.g., `.mp4`, `.webm` with a compatible codec like VP9 or VP8).\n\nAssuming you want to use H.264 video and AAC audio in MP4 for broad compatibility:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 10000000 -maxrate 10000000 -bufsize 2000000 -c:a ach -b:a 1000k -movflags +faststart - flagged_for_dvr 0 output.mp4\n```\n\nNote:\n- `-bufsize 2000000` helps with video quality since you specified `maxrate` which is max bitrate per stream, not allowed for Constant Rate Factor encoders; this sets a buffer size to control buffering.\n- `-flag:s dvr` disabled DVR compatibility if needed; uncomment to enable.\n- `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` together help regulate bitrate for fair quality and prevent spikes.\n  \nIf your input does not contain audio or you want any codec re-encoding, replace `-i input` with your input filename.\n\nFor browser streaming, ensure compatibility is maintained by using widely supported codecs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the output contains issues. The command has an error where it specifies `-c:a ach`, which likely is a typo or mistake and should be `-c:a aac`. Additionally, the command incorrectly includes `-flagged_for_dvr 0`, which is not a standard FFmpeg flag and is likely irrelevant.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, the output is similar to the failing example because it contains invalid command options that would cause it to fail. Specifically, the `-c:a ach` option is incorrect, which would result in an error when executing the command.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command does break requirements dictated in the man page. `-c:a ach` is not a recognized audio codec option, which violates the specified input/output option formats. Furthermore, the inclusion of `-flagged_for_dvr 0` does not conform to the expected format options, as it's not an available flag in the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does indeed contain issues that break the requirements for the command, so it should be marked as failing."
