  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "You want to overlay text and apply a blur effect to your video. This requires using multiple video filters chained together. I'll use the `drawtext` filter for the text and the `unsharp` filter for the blur.  I'll assume you want to position the text in the bottom right corner of the video.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **`drawtext`**: This filter draws text on the video.  We'll specify the text, font, color, size, and position.\n*   **`unsharp`**: This filter applies a sharpening effect, which can be used to enhance the blur.\n*   **Chaining**: Filters are chained using the `:` character.  The output of the first filter becomes the input of the second, and so on.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='My Text':fontfile=/path/to/your/font.ttf:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w-10):y=(h-text_h-10),unsharp=5:5:0.8:0.8:1:1\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file.\n*   `-vf \"...\"`:  Applies the video filters specified within the quotes.\n*   `drawtext=text='My Text':fontfile=/path/to/your/font.ttf:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w-10):y=(h-text_h-10)`:  Draws the text \"My Text\" using the font from `/path/to/your/font.ttf`, white color, 24pt font size, and positions it 10 pixels from the bottom right corner.  `w` and `h` represent the video width and height, and `text_w` and `text_h` represent the width and height of the text.\n*   `unsharp=5:5:0.8:0.8:1:1`: Applies an unsharp mask with the following parameters: `5:5` (luma and chroma kernel size), `0.8:0.8` (amount), `1:1` (luma and chroma ratio). These values can be adjusted to control the blur effect.\n*   `output.mp4`: Specifies the output video file.\n\n**Important Notes/Assumptions:**\n\n*   **Font File:** You'll need to replace `/path/to/your/font.ttf` with the actual path to a TrueType font file on your system.  If you don't have a font, you can use the default font, but it might not be readable.\n*   **Text Positioning:** The `x` and `y` parameters in `drawtext` calculate the position relative to the video dimensions.  Adjust the `10` values to fine-tune the text's position.\n*   **Blur Strength:** The `unsharp` filter's parameters control the blur. Experiment with different values to achieve the desired effect. Higher values mean more blur.\n*   **Compatibility:** The `drawtext` and `unsharp` filters are widely supported.\n*   **Performance:** Applying multiple filters can be computationally intensive.  Adjust the filter parameters and video settings to optimize performance.\n*   **Order of Operations:** The order of the filters matters. In this case, we apply the `drawtext` filter first, and then the `unsharp` filter.\n</output>",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated is valid and should work correctly for overlaying text and applying a blur effect using the specified filters. The command appears syntactically correct based on the usage of ffmpeg.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"drawtext=text='My Text':fontfile=/path/to/your/font.ttf:fontcolor=white:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w-10):y=(h-text_h-10),unsharp=5:5:0.8:0.8:1:1\" output.mp4`) is not using a non-existent preset or option that would result in a failure. It employs appropriate and valid filters.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly includes the input file specification, applies video filters using the `-vf` option, and specifies an output file. The chaining of filters using commas and parameters for `drawtext` and `unsharp` are all within the proper context.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nSince the generated command is valid, does not replicate a known failing output, and adheres to the man page specifications, the model's output does **not contain the issue**. It passes the evaluation."
