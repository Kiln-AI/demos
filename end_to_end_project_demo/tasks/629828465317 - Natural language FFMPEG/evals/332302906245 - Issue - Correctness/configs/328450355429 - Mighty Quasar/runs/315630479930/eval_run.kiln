  "input": "Can you double the speed of `fast_forward.mp4` but keep the original audio pitch?",
  "output": "To double the speed of a video while keeping the audio pitch unchanged, you can use the `setpts` filter for video and the `atempo` filter for audio. The `setpts=0.5*PTS` speeds up the video by 2x, and `atempo=2.0` doubles the audio speed while maintaining the original pitch.\n\nNote: `atempo` supports tempo from 0.5 to 2.0, so doubling speed with pitch preservation is straightforward.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i fast_forward.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]setpts=0.5*PTS[v];[0:a]atempo=2.0[a]\" -map \"[v]\" -map \"[a]\" output_double_speed.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not appear to contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly matches the user's request to double the speed of the video while maintaining the audio pitch. It utilizes appropriate filters (`setpts` for video and `atempo` for audio) to achieve this transformation, and no errors in the command syntax are present that would prevent it from executing properly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe output is not similar to the failing output example given. The command produced uses valid options and parameters, and correctly follows the ffmpeg syntax for combining video and audio processing. Additionally, it does not include any non-existent options or misapplied parameters, unlike the failing example provided.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command adheres to all the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-filter_complex` correctly allows for the simultaneous application of multiple filters. The parameters employed, specifically `setpts=0.5*PTS` and `atempo=2.0`, are valid and consistent with their defined behaviors in the ffmpeg documentation. There are no violations regarding ordering or option application.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does **not** contain the issue described; it passes the evaluation criteria."
