  "input": "I want to apply a complex video filter chain to add a watermark and adjust brightness. Use -vf 'scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2' to resize, add watermark, and brighten the video.",
  "output": "To apply a complex video filter chain that resizes the video, adds a watermark image, and adjusts brightness, use the following command. This assumes your original video is in a file named `input.mp4`, the watermark image is in a file named `watermark.png`, and the output video will be named `output.mp4`.\n\n- The `-vf` option specifies a filtergraph description.\n- `scale=1280:720` sets the output resolution to 1280x720. \n- `overlay=10:10:watermark.png` adds the watermark image, placed 10 pixels from the left and top of the video.\n- `brightness=0.2` adjusts the brightness, with values greater than 1 increasing brightness and values less than 1 decreasing it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=1280:720,overlay=10:10:watermark.png,brightness=0.2\" -c:v libx264 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: I added `-c:v libx264 -c:a copy` to specify the H.264 encoder, a widely supported and efficient codec, and to copy the audio stream without re-encoding it. You can modify these parameters as needed depending on your output requirements.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model appears to be accurate and should work correctly according to the user's request. The command implements a proper filter chain and all specified parameters accordingly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The failure example generated a command that referenced a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`) which would fail. In contrast, the output provided by the model includes valid options and parameters that are compliant with standard ffmpeg usage.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used (`-vf`, `scale`, `overlay`, `brightness`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`) are valid and respected in their correct application following ffmpeg's syntax and option requirements.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description, and thus it passes."
