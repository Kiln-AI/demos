  "input": "How do I chain together a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation (rotation and scaling) for my shaky footage?",
  "output": "To chain together stabilization, color grading, and geometric transformations in ffmpeg, you can combine multiple filters in the filter chain directly. The order of filters matters: first, apply cameras (shakiness correction), then apply color grading, and finally apply rotation and scaling as needed.\n\nKey points in the ffmpeg command:\n\n- **camlink** filters: For shakiness correction.\n- **colorprim**, **colortransfer**, and **colorspace** filters for advanced color grading using high-quality transfer curves.\n- **rotate**, **scale** filters for the final geometric transforms.\n- You can also chain multiple transformations. The output pixels are composed sequentially.\n\nExample:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_shaky.mp4 -vf \"cinelaurent-camlink=4,Clinetone=0.7:2.5,ColorPrim=2:2100:900,Q=0.65:1,Format=bt709:Use-HDR-Log=auto,Tonemap=HDR,ColorTransfer=bt709,Grain=128:0.2,Hue=T,Sat,Colorpick=1:0,Rotation=30,Square,Zoom=1.5\" -c:a copy output_colored.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- **cinelaurent-camlink=4**: Advanced camera shakiness correction filter with 4 iterations.\n- **Cinetone=0.7:2.5**: Gentle, balanced cinematone curve for skin tones and shadows.\n- **ColorPrim=2:2100:900**: Custom color prim (color temperature, gamma, and saturation) filter.\n- **Q=0.65:1,Format=bt709,Use-HDR-Log=auto,Tonemap=HDR**: Convert to HDR format, apply tone mapping for better contrast (optional, adjust as needed).\n- **ColorTransfer=bt709**: Converts to BT.709 color space for wide compatibility.\n- **Grain=128:0.2**: Adds subtle texture for depth.\n- **Hue**, **Sat,Colorpick=1:0**: Color grading via hue, saturation, and color channel selection.\n- **Rotation=30,Square**: Rotate 30° clockwise and constrain the output aspect ratio to maintain square format after rotation.\n- **Zoom=1.5**: Scaling factor after rotation with zoom.\n\nCustomize parameters like ` Rotation`, `Zoom`, input/camera shakiness, or color options based on your specific requirements and source color look.\n\nThis command demonstrates chaining filters sequentially, a best practice for complex workflows.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_shaky.mp4 -vf \"cinelaurent-camlink=4,Clinetone=0.7:2.5,ColorPrim=2:2100:900,Q=0.65:1,Format=bt709:Use-HDR-Log=auto,Tonemap=HDR,ColorTransfer=bt709,Grain=128:0.2,Hue=50:100:0,Sat=1,Square,Zoom=1.5\" -c:a copy output_colored.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step using the provided criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe issue described states that sometimes the model makes mistakes in the `ffmpeg` command it generates, and we need to ensure it generates a command that works correctly and matches the user's requirements. The model's output command includes various filters, but several of the filters mentioned (like `cinelaurent-camlink`, `Cinetone`, `ColorPrim`, `Hue`, `Sat`, `Rotation`, and `Zoom`) are not standard `ffmpeg` filter options and appear to be either incorrectly named or non-existent. The command does not correctly implement the user’s request for a stabilization filter, color grading, and geometric transformation as it misidentifies filters.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nYes, the output contains filters that do not exist, similar to how the failure example contains an incorrect preset (`extra_fast`). The use of arbitrary or incorrectly named filters renders the command non-functional, which is akin to providing a command that contains no valid options.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does break the man page requirements. First, it uses non-standard filters, and it does not follow the proper syntax for chaining filters. The filters mentioned do not conform to the known valid `ffmpeg` filter names, thus rendering the entire command invalid based on the official documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, it does contain the issue described. The various non-standard filters imply that the command will not work, thus failing to meet user requirements. Therefore, this output should fail the evaluation.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output contains significant errors in the `ffmpeg` command generated, leading to a failure in meeting the task's needs."
