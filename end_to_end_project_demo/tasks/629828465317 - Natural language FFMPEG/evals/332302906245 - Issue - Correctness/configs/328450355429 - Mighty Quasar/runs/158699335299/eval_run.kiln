  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from your source file, you can use `-map` options in ffmpeg. For example, `-map 0:v:1` maps the second video stream, and `-map 0:a:3` maps the fourth audio stream (stream indexing starts at 0).\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the 2nd video stream (index 1).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the 4th audio stream (index 3).\n\nAssuming you want to include all other streams by default, you can use `-map 0:m:m` to map all default streams or use the `-map` options accordingly.\n\nHere’s a summary:\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` for second video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:3` for fourth audio stream.\n- No need to specify video/audio codecs unless you want to overwrite the default encoding.\n- Output container as is or pick a format based on the source file extension.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.avi\n```\n\nIn this example, I’ve assumed you want to copy (stream copy) the streams without re-encoding. Adjust `-c copy` to your encoding needs if required. If the input file and streams have different containers, change the output extension appropriately (e.g., `.mp4` or `.mkv`).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the given input file without any configuration errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command produced by the model (`ffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.avi`) adheres to the correct syntax for mapping streams and does not use any incorrect options or parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the streams to include from the input file, and it uses `-c copy` to copy the selected streams without re-encoding. The command structure follows the ffmpeg syntax, where the input file is specified before the output file along with its options.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and thus it passes the evaluation for correctness regarding generating a working ffmpeg command."
