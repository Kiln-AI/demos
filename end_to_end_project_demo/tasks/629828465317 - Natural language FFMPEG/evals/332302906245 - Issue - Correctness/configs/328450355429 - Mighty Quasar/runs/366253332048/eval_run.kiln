  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To convert the vertical video to 16:9 widescreen, you need to:\n1. Keep the original video centered\n2. Add blurred sidebars using the same video content (so the blurring matches the content)\n3. Ensure the final output is 16:9 format (1920×1080 recommended for 9:16 → 16:9 conversion)\n\nThe technique uses FFmpeg's `scale`, `split`, `boxblur` and `overlay` filters to create side-blurred bars that match your content, then composes everything together.\n\nAssuming your vertical video is 1080×1920, and you want a 1920×1080 output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n  -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1080:1080,crop=1080:1080,\\\n  split=3[out][blur][original];\\\n  [blur]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=luma_radius=min(h,w)/20:luma_power=1:chroma_radius=min(cw,ch)/20:chroma_power=1[blurred];\\\n  [blurred][original]overlay=(main_w-overlay_w)/2:(main_h-overlay_h)/2[out]\" \\\n  -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_widescreen.mp4\n```\n\nWhat's happening:\n- First scale your vertical video to fill a 1080×1080 square (keeping the widest possible portion of the original video)\n- Split into 3 streams: output placeholder (unused), blurred background, and original video\n- Blurred background stream scales to 1920×1080 and applies a gentle box blur to avoid sharp edges\n- Final overlay centers your original video over the blurred background\n\nIf your vertical video has a different resolution (like 720×1280), you can adjust the first scale+crop numbers accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated looks to be accurate and follows the requirements set by the user, achieving the transformation of a vertical video to a 16:9 widescreen video with blurred bars.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is well-structured and utilizes appropriate filters and options for the task, unlike the simple and incorrect command in the failure example.\n\n3) Reviewing the generated command against the FFmpeg man page requirements shows that it does **not** break any requirements dictated. The command correctly specifies input and output files, uses the required filters and options, and follows the syntax rules.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output is valid and passes. It successfully creates the desired output without any evident errors or issues."
