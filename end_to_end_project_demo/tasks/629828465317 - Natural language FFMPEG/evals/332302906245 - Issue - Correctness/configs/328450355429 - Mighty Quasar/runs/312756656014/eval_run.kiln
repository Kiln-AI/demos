  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with maximum compression. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, they need to extract the audio stream. The input is a video file, so I'll use the -i option. Then, specify the audio codec as FLAC. The maximum compression for FLAC would be the -compression_level parameter. FLAC's compression levels range from 1 (fastest, least compression) to 8 (slowest, most compression). So setting that to 8 would be maximum compression.\n\nWait, does FLAC support compression_level? Let me confirm. Yes, the -compression_level option is available for FLAC. So I should include that. Also, they might want to ensure that the audio is extracted without any video. So using the -vn option to disable video. Then, output the audio as a FLAC file. The command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n\nBut wait, maybe the user wants to keep the original audio codec and just convert it to FLAC? But the question says \"extract audio\" so probably they just want to take the audio from the video and save it as FLAC. Also, the maximum compression preset for FLAC would be the highest compression level, which is 8. So I should set that. Also, check if any other parameters are needed. Maybe -ar and -ac for sample rate and channels, but the user didn't specify, so it's safe to assume default settings. So the command should be straightforward.\n</think>\n\nTo extract audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, use the `-c:a flac` codec and set `-compression_level 8` (FLAC's highest compression level). The `-vn` flag ensures only audio is extracted, and no video is included in the output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n``` \n\nThis command preserves the original audio quality while applying FLAC's maximum compression for smaller file size. Note that higher compression levels may increase encoding time.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is correct and meets the user's requirements of extracting audio from the video and saving it as a FLAC file with maximum compression.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The generated command is valid and adheres to the correct parameters and options related to the task.\n\n3) Referring to the man page for ffmpeg, the command does not break any requirements. The model correctly uses the `-i` option for input, the `-vn` option to disable video, the `-c:a flac` option to specify the audio codec, and the `-compression_level 8` to apply maximum compression. All these options are aligned with the requirements and syntax outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Given the steps above, the model's output does not contain any issues, thus it should pass according to the evaluation criteria. The command is appropriate, works correctly, and matches the user's requirements accurately."
