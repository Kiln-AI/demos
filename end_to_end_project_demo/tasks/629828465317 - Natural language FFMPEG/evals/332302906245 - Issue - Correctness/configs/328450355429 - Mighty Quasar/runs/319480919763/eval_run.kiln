  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To achieve this, we'll use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 3 -map 2 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:v 5000k -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map 3` maps the third video stream (`v3`) from the input file to the output file.\n- `-map 2` maps the second audio stream (`a2`) from the input file to the output file.\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264.\n- `-c:a aac` sets the audio codec to AAC.\n- `-b:v 5000k` sets the video bitrate to 5000 kbps.\n- `-b:a 128k` sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The source file `multi.avi` has multiple video and audio streams, with at least three video streams and two audio streams.\n- The third video stream (`v3`) and the second audio stream (`a2`) are not default streams (i.e., they are not the first video stream or the first audio stream).\n- The output file is a single MP4 file.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated appears valid and correctly matches the requirements from the user regarding stream mapping and output file format.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model was formulated correctly and did not include any invalid parameters, such as a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used in the command are valid and conform to the expected syntax as stated in the documentation. The parameters used clearly define the video and audio codecs, as well as the correct mapping of streams.\n\n4) Given the information analyzed, the model's output does not contain the specified issue and should be considered a success in generating a correct and functional ffmpeg command."
