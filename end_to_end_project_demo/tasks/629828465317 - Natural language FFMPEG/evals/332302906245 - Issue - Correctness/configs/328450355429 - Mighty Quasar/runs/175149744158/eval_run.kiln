  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your file with a constant video bitrate of 25000 kbps, you need to specify the bitrate using `-b:v 25000k` and use a suitable video codec like libx264. This approach forces the video bitrate to be near 25 Mbps. For audio, I'll assume you want to keep the original or encode with AAC at a decent bitrate (128k). Also, to make it usable for streaming, we can add `-movflags +faststart`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n(Replace `input` and `output.mp4` with your actual filenames.)",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly specifies a constant bitrate for the video stream as requested by the user, using the `-b:v` option. It also includes a video codec (libx264), an audio codec (AAC), and the `-movflags +faststart` option for streaming compatibility. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided failure example. Both the syntax and the options used in the command are valid and do not include any non-existent arguments or incorrectly applied parameters. The output appears appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used (`-i`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-preset`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, `-pix_fmt`, `-movflags`) are valid, and the overall structure aligns with the syntax outlined in the man page for setting input and output files, as well as specifying their respective options.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluation, the model's output **does not contain the issue described** and thus **passes** the evaluation."
