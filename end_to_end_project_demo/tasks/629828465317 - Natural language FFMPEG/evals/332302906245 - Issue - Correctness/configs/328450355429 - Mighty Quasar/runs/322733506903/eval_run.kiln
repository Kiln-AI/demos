  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To map the 6th video stream and the 9th audio stream from the input file and encode them into `output.mp4`, we use the `-map` option to specify the desired streams. The stream indices in FFmpeg are 0-based, so \"video stream 6\" refers to index `6` (7th stream in 1-based counting) and \"audio stream 9\" refers to index `9`. The output will use default encodings (H.264 for video and AAC for audio), which are compatible with MP4 format.\n\n- `-map 0:v:6`: Selects the 6th video stream from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:9`: Selects the 9th audio stream from the input.\n- `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`: Uses H.264 for video and AAC for audio, which are standard for MP4.\n- `-preset fast`: Optimizes encoding speed for faster processing.\n- `-crf 23`: Sets video quality (lower is better; 23 is a good default).\n- `-b:a 128k`: Sets audio bitrate to 128 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i inputfile -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n1. The input file contains at least 6 video streams and 9 audio streams with 0-based indexing.  \n2. The audio codec of the 9th stream is compatible with AAC. If not, you may need to specify a different audio codec (e.g., `-c:a copy` if the original is supported).  \n3. The 6th video stream is compatible with H.264 encoding. If not, adjust the video codec accordingly (e.g., `-c:v copy` if the original codec is supported).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is appropriate for the user's request to map specific video and audio streams to an output file without any incorrect options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command includes valid options and accurately maps the specified audio and video streams without using any invalid parameters or options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The output command structure is valid and adheres to the syntax and usage for mapping and encoding streams.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, the model should pass this evaluation."
