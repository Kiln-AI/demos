  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": " To extract stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio in the source.mkv file, which contains multiple tracks, use the following ffmpeg command:\n\n- `-map 15:v` selects stream 15 for video output\n- `-map 22:a` selects stream 22 for audio output\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video without re-encoding (quick, but only works if the stream is already in a compatible format)\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio without re-encoding (also quick, but only works if the stream is already in a compatible format)\n- `-protocol_whitelist 'file,http,https,tcp,tls,rtp,udp,multicast,camcorder,camcontrol,local' -f rtmps` creates an RTMP-stream over TLS/RTSP (for wider compatibility)\n- `-listen 1` tells ffmpeg to listen for incoming RTMP connections\n- `f=rtmps://STREAM_S3/STREAM_NAME` sets the incoming RTMP source on the stream_s3 server with a specific name for the stream\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 15:v -map 22:a -c:v copy -c:a copy -protocol_whitelist 'file,http,https,tcp,tls,rtp,udp,multicast,camcorder,camcontrol,local' -f rtmps -listen 1 f=rtmps://STREAM_S3/STREAM_NAME\n```\n\nReplacements for `STREAM_S3` and `STREAM_NAME`:\n\nReplace `STREAM_S3` & `STREAM_NAME` with your actual server addresses and desired stream names.\n\nThis command assumes that the video stream is present, and you specified stream number 15 for video, and the audio stream is present, and you specified stream number 22 for audio. It also assumes you're targeting a streaming platform that supports RTMP over TLS/RTSP, and your server allows incoming RTMP connections on the specified address and port.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nYes, the output contains an issue. The command generated by the model is incorrectly structured due to the placement of the `-f rtmps` option. The correct order for specifying the format (`-f`) and the output destination is violated. The `-f` option should immediately precede the output file argument, not be placed before other options. Additionally, the syntax for specifying the output URL is incorrect; it should be `rtmps://STREAM_S3/STREAM_NAME` without the preceding `f=`.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n\nNot exactly. The example failure output provided indicates an incorrect preset value, which the model's output does not exhibit. However, the command is still syntactically incorrect because of improper ordering.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n\nYes, the command violates the requirement on ordering dictated in the man page. The `-f` option should directly precede the output file (which is not done correctly here). The placement of the `-f rtmps` following multiple options before the output also suggests that it does not adhere to the strict option order required by `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n\nYes, the output contains significant issues that would cause the command to fail in execution, primarily due to incorrect ordering of options. Therefore, it does not pass the evaluation criteria and fails based on the requirements of the task."
