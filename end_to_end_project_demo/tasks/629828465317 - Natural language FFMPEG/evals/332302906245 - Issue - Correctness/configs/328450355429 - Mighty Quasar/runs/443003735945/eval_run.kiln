  "output": "To convert input.mov to MP4 using the H.265/HEVC codec (libx265) with a high-quality setting, you should use the following command. CRF 18 is considered visually lossless or high quality for most content. Note that HEVC (H.265) is less widely supported than H.264 but is more efficient.\n\n- -c:v libx265 specifies the H.265/HEVC encoder.\n- -crf 18 sets the constant rate factor for high quality (lower is better; 18 is commonly recommended for visually lossless output).\n- -c:a aac encodes audio with AAC (for browser/device compatibility), at 128k bitrate.\n- -tag:v hvc1 ensures better compatibility with MP4 players (some expect this fourcc for HEVC in MP4 files).\n- -movflags +faststart places metadata at the beginning for fast streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx265 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -tag:v hvc1 -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions: You want to keep the original resolution and frame rate, and produce an MP4 compatible with as many players as possible given H.265 limits. If you need to scale or do other processing, let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated by the model is valid and properly reflects the user's request to convert `input.mov` to MP4 using the `libx265` codec with `CRF 18` for high quality.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced is syntactically correct and utilizes valid FFmpeg options; it is not indicative of a failure.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command follows the proper structure outlined for FFmpeg usage, including specifying input, output, codecs, and options properly.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe command generated does not contain any issues and successfully meets the requirements requested by the user. Therefore, it should pass."
