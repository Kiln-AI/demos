  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "You want to extract specific streams from the input file and save them to a new MP4 file. The `-map` option selects the streams by their stream specifiers. By default, ffmpeg copies streams without re-encoding if the codecs are compatible with the output format; otherwise, specify the codecs.\n\nAssuming stream 0:4 is video and 0:9 is audio, and that their codecs are compatible with MP4 (H.264/AVC for video, AAC for audio), you can copy them directly for speed and quality preservation. If not, you would need to re-encode.\n\nHere's how to select those streams and copy them into trimmed.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nNote: If the codecs of those streams are not compatible with MP4 container, you will get an error and may need to specify re-encoding parameters. Let me know if you want that.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description? \nThe model's output appears to address the user’s request correctly by providing a suitable ffmpeg command that selects the specified streams and saves them to the output file. There are no indications that the command will fail, given the assumption that the codecs for streams 0:4 and 0:9 are compatible with the MP4 format. Thus, the output does not contain the specified issue.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?\nThe model's output does not resemble the failing example. It generates a valid and correctly formatted ffmpeg command based on the user’s input, which is not an arbitrary or incorrect command like the one in the failure example.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command `ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy trimmed.mp4` conforms to the syntax and options stipulated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, uses the `-map` option appropriately to select specific streams, and sets the output file. There are no apparent violations of the requirements discussed in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a command that meets the requirements of the user. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
