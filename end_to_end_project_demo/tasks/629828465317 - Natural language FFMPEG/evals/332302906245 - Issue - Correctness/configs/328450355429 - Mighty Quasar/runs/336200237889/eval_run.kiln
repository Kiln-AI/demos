  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate video 90 degrees clockwise, you can use the `transpose=1` filter in ffmpeg. For advanced noise reduction with strong filtering, the `hqdn3d` filter is commonly used for high-quality denoising. You can increase its strength by setting higher values.\n\n`hqdn3d` takes parameters like `luma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_spatial:chroma_tmp`. Strong filtering can be done with values around 10 for spatial and temporal luma and chroma.\n\nHere's an example command that rotates 90 degrees clockwise and applies strong noise reduction:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=10:10:10:10\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `transpose=1`: rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `hqdn3d=10:10:10:10`: strong spatial and temporal noise reduction on luma and chroma.\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23`: re-encode video with good quality.\n- `-c:a copy`: copies audio without re-encoding.\n\nAssumption: Input video is named `input.mp4`. Output file is `output.mp4`. Adjust filenames as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue describedâ€”specifically, the ffmpeg command it generated is correct for the task of rotating the video 90 degrees clockwise and applying advanced noise reduction. The command uses the right filters and parameters according to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated is valid and utilizes appropriate parameters for the task without referencing any nonexistent presets or codes.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax and order of the options are correct, along with the use of valid filter parameters (`transpose` and `hqdn3d`). The model also correctly includes video codec encoding settings.\n\n4) The model's output passes all the criteria. It generates a correct and appropriate ffmpeg command matching the user's requirements without any errors or omissions, thus it does not contain the issue described."
