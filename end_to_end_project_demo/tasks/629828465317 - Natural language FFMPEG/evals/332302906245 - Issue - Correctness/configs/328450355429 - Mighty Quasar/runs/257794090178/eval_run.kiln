  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream from the input file `movie.mkv` and save them into a new MP4 file `final.mp4`, we use FFmpegâ€™s stream selection capabilities.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (since indexing starts at 0).\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac` re-encodes the selected audio stream to AAC (MP4 usually supports only AAC for audio, assuming you want MP4 compatibility).\n- `-movflags +faststart` allows the MP4 to be playable when streaming from the web (optionally added for compatibility).\n\nThis command assumes the audio is not in an unsupported format like AC-3 or DTS, which AAC will not re-encode directly. If the audio uses such a format, it may need a more complex re-encoding approach, potentially using a codec like `aac` with `-vn` and `-i`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a aac final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly implements the stream selection and encoding needed for the task. The use of `-map` for selecting the first video stream and the third audio stream aligns with user requirements. Additionally, it uses appropriate codecs for the MP4 format without any erroneous commands or parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and contains parameters that are recognized by FFmpeg. It does not use any non-existent options or misconfigured styles that would lead to a failure, unlike the example provided which contains `-preset extra_fast`, which is nonexistent.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page. The format of the command adheres to the specified options for input and output files, as well as stream mapping. All parameters used, including `-c:v copy` and `-c:a aac`, are valid and appropriately placed. The command structure follows the syntax guidelines laid out for FFmpeg command usage.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue described and adheres to the requirements. It successfully produces a valid command that matches the user's intentions."
