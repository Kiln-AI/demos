  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add new subtitle tracks while removing all existing subtitle tracks from the input video, you can use the `-map` option to explicitly include the main video and audio streams plus the new subtitles, and the `-map 0:s:m` option to exclude all subtitle and movie (synchronized) streams. However, because `-map 0:s:m` removes all subtitle and movie tracks including embedded subtitles, you need to include only the subtitle streams you want to keep. A common approach is to copy existing subtitle streams if they exist or add new ones directly via `-f subtitles`.\n\nHere's a step-by-step command:\n\n1. Determine the language of your new subtitle file or enter subtitle stream index.\n2. Add subtitles by muxing subtitles from a file or specify index from the input.\n3. Remove all existing subtitle tracks by not mapping them.\n\nAssuming you use an external `.srt` subtitle file named `subtitles.srt` and want all subtitle streams from the input converted to selectable tracks, you can:\n\n- Use `-map 0` for the video and audio from the input.\n- Add the subtitle stream(s) via `-map 0:s` to keep the existing extracted subtitle streams and add new ones from the file.\n- Use `-map 0:a` to include audio.\n- Use `-c copy` to copy video and audio streams without re-encoding for good quality.\n- Use `-c:s Ass` or `-c:s mov_text` for embedded subtitle support in MP4 container.\n\nIf you want to burn the external subtitle file directly (making it a hardcode subtitle without selectable track in the output), options change:\n\n- Use `-subtitles` for a text output like MP4/H.264 video with embedded subtitles.\n- Not suitable for browser compatibility.\n\n---\n\n### Command to add new subtitle tracks and remove existing ones:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:s -c copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v -map 0:a` maps video and audio streams from the input.\n- `-map 0:s` maps all subtitle streams from the input.\n- `-c copy` copies audio and video without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s mov_text` converts embedded subtitles to text-based MP4 subtitles.\n- Result: all subtitle streams are retained and added as selectable subtitles, and existing subtitle tracks from the input are removed.\n\n---\n\n### Example with an external SRT subtitle file:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 0:s -c copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\n**Summary:**\nThis two-step approach preserves video and audio while adding new or keeping extracted subtitle streams if external files are provided.\n\n---\n\nIf you want browser compatibility, consider embedding subtitles in selectable tracks by copying subtitle streams or burn them in (hardcoding). Let me know if you need browser-specific commands!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is logically structured and coherent, mapping video and audio streams explicitly while adding new subtitle tracks. However, the explanation reflects some confusion over removing existing subtitles versus retaining them for external subtitle files. The command does not effectively achieve the requirement of removing all existing subtitle tracks while adding new ones. The use of `-map 0:s` suggests it will retain existing subtitle tracks instead of removing them.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output is not similar to the failing example. Although the command could lead to undesired results by not removing existing tracks, it does not contain an outright syntax error or use of invalid options.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not violate any explicit requirements outlined in the man page for ffmpeg. However, it may lead to unintended consequences since it maps existing subtitle streams even when the user requests their removal. The command could be refined to align closely with the userâ€™s intent.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   - The model does not fully meet the user requirements since it fails to completely remove existing subtitle tracks when adding new ones. While the command syntax is correct, it does not align perfectly with the task. Thus, the model produced a command with an inherent issue related to user requirements. Therefore, the evaluation should conclude that there is an effective issue present in the output concerning the requirement of removing all existing subtitles while adding new ones. The output does not pass in the context of user requirements."
