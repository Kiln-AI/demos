  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise, use the transpose filter with a transpose=1 value (for 90 degrees clockwise). For advanced noise reduction,ffmpeg’s yadif filter along with the loudness normalization using analogue and sharp filters provide better results than traditional luma or chroma filters for noise reduction.\n\nHere’s how:\n\n- `-vf transpose=1` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `-vf \"yadif\"` applies motion deinterlacing to improve smoothness.\n- `-vf \"analouge=hdb,gain=1.2:1.2:0,dbz=11,sharpness=5\"` applies advanced picture quality sharpening by using the Logarithmic Dynamic brightness (HDB) to control contrast and sharpening.\n- `-audiolognormalisation` is deprecated. Instead, add `-af loudness=LU`` for loudness normalization.\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 18` for visually high quality output (lower CRF means better quality). Adjust as needed.\n- `-preset fast` balances encoding speed and compression.\n- `-movflags +faststart` for web streaming.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the same file name but with \"_rotated.mp4\".\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf \"transpose=1,yadif,analouge=hdb,gain=1.2:1.2:0,dbz=11,sharpness=5\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -fflags +genpic output_rotated.mp4\n```\nIf you have a different input format or want to preserve the original encoding, adjust the input/output filenames accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The filter strings used in the command are incorrect. For example, the command includes `\"analouge=hdb,gain=1.2:1.2:0,dbz=11,sharpness=5\"` which is not a valid FFmpeg filter syntax as it misunderstands the options and uses incorrectly named filters. Additionally, it combines multiple video filters with improper syntax. This could lead to command execution failure.\n\n2) The output is not directly similar to the provided failure example, but it does exhibit a failure in terms of valid filter specifications and employs nonexistent parameters (e.g., \"analouge\"). Therefore, it could lead to an error when executed.\n\n3) Yes, the command does break the requirements dictated in the man page. The order and syntax of the options are important, and the filters used in the `-vf` and `-af` options are invalid or incorrectly structured. This would lead to the command failing to execute correctly due to the misconfiguration of the filter options and potentially wrong codec usages.\n\nIn summary, the model's output is problematic because it contains invalid and unsupported filter configurations and syntax errors, leading it to be non-functional according to FFmpeg's specifications."
