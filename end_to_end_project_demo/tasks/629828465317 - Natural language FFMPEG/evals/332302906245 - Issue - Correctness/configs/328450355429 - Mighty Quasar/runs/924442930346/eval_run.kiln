  "input": "I want to encode my video with the flash preset to get the conversion done as quickly as possible.",
  "output": "To encode your video using the \"flash\" preset, you can use the `-preset` option with the value `flash`. However, note that presets prioritize encoding speed over compression efficiency. This means your output file may be larger than if you had used a different preset like `slower`, `veryslow`, or others.\n\nAssuming you're working with an H.264 MP4 output and want a reasonable quality, here's a command to encode your video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset flash output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes:\n- The input is `input.mp4` (you should replace it with your actual file name).\n- You want to encode to H.264 MP4 (a widely supported format).\n- You don't care too much about audio encoding settings (the default AAC settings will be used). \n\nNote: Be careful when using lower presets with x264 (like `ultrafast` and `flash`) since the decoded video frames might not be identical with the ones encoded with the default or slower presets.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command using the \"flash\" preset, which exists in the context of `ffmpeg`. The command is structured correctly and aligns with the requirements given by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command utilizes the preset \"flash\" correctly, whereas the failing example uses a non-existent preset \"extra_fast.\" The provided preset \"flash\" exists and can be used in `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) Referring to the `ffmpeg` man page, the command provided:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset flash output.mp4\n```\ndoes not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options are appropriately used: `-i` denotes the input file; `-c:v libx264` specifies the video codec; `-preset flash` appropriately applies the designated preset, and the output file is specified correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It successfully delivers a valid command that matches the user's requirements without any errors or misconfigurations. Hence, it passes."
