  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a media file, use the -map option in ffmpeg. This allows you to select exactly which video, audio, or subtitle streams to include.\n\n- -map 0:1 selects the second video stream (indexing starts at 0, so 0:1 is the second stream).\n- -map 0:3 selects the fourth audio stream.\n- -c copy avoids re-encoding, so extraction is fast and lossless (assuming source codecs are compatible with MP4; otherwise, re-encoding may be needed).\n- .mp4 container usually requires H.264 (video) and AAC (audio). If the source streams are already compatible (e.g., H.264 video and AAC audio), you can copy. Otherwise, you need to re-encode.\n\nAssuming the selected streams are MP4-compatible, here’s how you extract them:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```\n\nIf you receive errors about incompatible codecs for MP4, re-encode streams as needed, e.g., for unsupported video/audio:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental result.mp4\n```\n\nThis second command ensures output streams are compatible with MP4. Use the first command for best performance, and fall back to re-encoding if necessary.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described; it correctly generates an ffmpeg command that should work for extracting the specified video and audio streams from the input file. The command created by the model is logical and matches the requirements set forth by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`). In the model’s output, the command is valid and appropriately constructed for the desired extraction task, unlike the example that contains an invalid command.\n\n3) The model's command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It uses the correct syntax and options to specify which input streams to select and copies them without re-encoding (assuming compatibility with MP4).\n\nGiven that the model's output meets the requirements, does not exhibit any of the issues pointed out, and follows the rules stated in the ffmpeg man page, I conclude that the model performed correctly on this task. Therefore, the performance evaluation passes."
