  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with noise reduction, you'll need to:\n\n- Use `-vn` to disable video recording and only process audio.\n- Use `-af` with an audio filter for noise reduction. A commonly used simple noise reduction filter is `afftdn` in ffmpeg.\n- Use `-c:a flac` for FLAC encoding. The FLAC encoder in ffmpeg may be labeled as experimental in some builds, so you can add `-strict experimental` to allow its use.\n\nHere's the command assuming you want basic noise reduction with `afftdn`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vn`: no video.\n- `-af afftdn`: performs frequency-domain noise reduction.\n- `-c:a flac`: encode audio as FLAC.\n- `-strict experimental`: permits experimental codecs (FLAC may be considered experimental depending on build).\n\nIf you want more advanced noise profiling (like noise profiling and reduction), ffmpeg alone might not be sufficient or straightforward; external tools like Audacity or SoX could be required. But for a simple noise reduction filter, this command works.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "The evaluation of the model's output shows that it does not contain any issues with the FFmpeg command it generated. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1) The model's output does not contain an issue as described in the issue description. The command provided (```ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac```) correctly extracts audio from the video file and saves it as a FLAC file, which is aligned with the user's request. It also properly indicates noise reduction.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command uses valid parameters and options that exist in FFmpeg. The use of `-strict experimental` indicates awareness about the codec's status but successfully allows the command to utilize it.\n\n3) Reviewing the command against the FFmpeg man page shows that it adheres to the syntax and requirements: \n   - `-vn` correctly disables video recording.\n   - `-af afftdn` applies an audio filter for noise reduction and is a valid filter available in FFmpeg.\n   - `-c:a flac` specifies the audio codec correctly.\n   - `-strict experimental` is included to ensure the command can accept the FLAC codec, which may be marked as experimental in certain builds.\n\nBased on this assessment, the command produced by the model is correct, complies with FFmpeg requirements, and does not contain an issue. Therefore, it demonstrates proper performance on the task."
