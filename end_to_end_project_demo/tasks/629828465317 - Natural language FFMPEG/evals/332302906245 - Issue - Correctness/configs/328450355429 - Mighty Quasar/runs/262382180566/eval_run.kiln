  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific video and audio streams from a multi-track MKV file, use the `-map` option to explicitly choose stream indices. Note that in FFmpeg, stream indices are **0-based** (e.g., `-map 0:v:15` refers to the 16th video stream if counting from 1). If the specified streams are not compatible with the output format (e.g., MKV audio in MP4), you may need to re-encode them. For this command, I'll assume the streams are compatible and use `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-map 0:v:15`: Explicitly selects the 15th video stream (0-based) from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:22`: Explicitly selects the 22nd audio stream (0-based) from the input.\n- `-c copy`: Copies streams without re-encoding (fastest method). If this fails, replace with specific codecs (e.g., `-c:v h264 -c:a aac`).  \n- **Assumption:** The user has confirmed the correct stream indices (15 for video, 22 for audio) and that the codecs are compatible with the output format (e.g., MP4). For safety, check stream indices first using `ffmpeg -i source.mkv`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly reflects the user's requirements of selecting specific video and audio streams from a multi-track MKV file. The use of the `-map` option with the correct stream indices is appropriate and follows the guidelines for generating an FFmpeg command.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The generated command is valid and uses correctly specified options. The command structure is appropriate and uses valid parameters as per the FFmpeg syntax.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command follows the syntax rules correctly, specifying the input file and the mapping for the output file appropriately. The `-c copy` option is suitable for this command, assuming the user has compatible streams for the MP4 output format.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output passes as it does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated is valid, follows the user's request accurately, and adheres to the specifications laid out in the FFmpeg man page."
