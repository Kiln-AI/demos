  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression:\n\n- `ffmpeg -i video.mp4` indicates the input file.\n- `-vn` disables video processing (removes the video stream).\n- `-c:a flac` selects the FLAC audio codec for compression.\n- `-compression_level 12` uses FLAC's highest available compression level (12) for maximum efficiency.\n- This assumes the input audio format can be losslessly converted to FLAC (e.g., PCM, ALAC, etc.).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 12 output.flac\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for the user ask, and it correctly extracts audio from the specified video file while saving it as a FLAC file. The parameters used align with user requirements as well as FFmpeg's capabilities.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and uses recognized parameters and options, in contrast to the failing example where an invalid preset was mentioned.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. Each of the options used, such as `-vn`, `-c:a flac`, and `-compression_level 12` are valid according to the documentation. The command structure is also correct, with the input file and output file specified properly.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output passes the evaluation. It accurately produces a command that listens to the user's request and keeps in line with FFmpeg documentation. Thus, it does not contain any issues as described in the given criteria."
