  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the first video stream and the third audio stream from movie.mkv and save them into an MP4 (final.mp4), you can use stream selection with the -map option:\n\n- -map 0:v:0 selects the first video stream (the 0th video stream in the first input, index is zero-based).\n- -map 0:a:2 selects the third audio stream (the 2nd audio stream in zero-based counting).\n- -c copy copies the streams without re-encoding for maximum quality and speed (assumes both streams are compatible with MP4 container; most common video/audio codecs are).\n\nIf the codecs are not compatible with MP4 (e.g., the audio is in a format not supported by MP4), you'll need to re-encode at least the audio (let me know if you need that).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will quickly remux the selected streams into an MP4 without loss. If you want to explicitly re-encode the audio (e.g., to AAC), replace `-c copy` with `-c:v copy -c:a aac`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select the first video and the third audio stream, and it utilizes `-c copy` for efficient copying without re-encoding, assuming codec compatibility with the MP4 container.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command it provided is correct and does not contain any invalid options or parameters contrary to the FFmpeg capabilities.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It adheres to proper order, syntax, and usage of the `-map` options for selecting streams and the `-c copy` option for copying codec data.\n\n4) Based on the analysis, the model's output does **not** contain any significant issues or discrepancies and successfully meets the requirements of the user. Thus, it should be marked as passing."
