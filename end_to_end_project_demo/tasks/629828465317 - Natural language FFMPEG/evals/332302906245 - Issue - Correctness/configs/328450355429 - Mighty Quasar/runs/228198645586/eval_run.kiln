  "input": "Take my video `input.avi` and add a watermark image `logo.png` to the bottom left corner. The watermark should be semi-transparent.",
  "output": "To add a semi-transparent watermark to the bottom left corner, use the `overlay` filter combined with `format=rgba` and `colorchannelmixer` to adjust the watermark's opacity. The watermark will be placed at x=10 pixels from the left and y=main_h-overlay_h-10 pixels from the bottom for some padding.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -i logo.png -filter_complex \"[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.4[wm];[0][wm]overlay=x=10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `[1]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.4[wm]` converts the watermark to RGBA and sets its alpha (opacity) to 0.4 (40% opacity).\n- `[0][wm]overlay=x=10:y=main_h-overlay_h-10` places the watermark on the bottom left with 10 pixels padding horizontally and vertically.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the original audio without re-encoding.\n- Output container is MP4; you can change it if needed.\n\nAssumes that you want output in MP4 format; if otherwise, replace `output.mp4` with your desired filename and format.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command produced is correctly structured to achieve the user's request of adding a semi-transparent watermark image to a video file without any notable mistakes in the command translation.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output provided, as the command does not use any incorrect parameters or options that would cause it to fail directly. Instead, it employs valid FFmpeg syntax and options necessary for the watermarking task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All specified options and formats are correctly applied according to the syntax rules laid out. The filters, parameters, and overlays are applied properly and adhere to input-output ordering.\n\n4) Given the aforementioned points, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
