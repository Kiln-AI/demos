  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, we use `-map` options. The video streams are indexed starting from 0, so the third video stream would be `0:v:2`. Similarly, the second audio stream would be `0:a:1`. We'll copy the streams without re-encoding for maximum quality and speed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   No, the model's output does not contain the issue. The generated command adheres to the user's request to map specific streams from the `multi.avi` file to the output file `final.mp4`. The use of the `-map` options and the `-c copy` settings is appropriate for copying the designated streams without re-encoding.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example. The command generated by the model uses valid parameters and syntax according to the FFmpeg command structure. It does not reference any non-existent options or incorrectly format any commands.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The command follows the proper syntax for mapping inputs to outputs and utilizes valid options such as `-map` and `-c copy`. This is consistent with how FFmpeg operates as described in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The output does not contain the issue and should pass the evaluation. The command is valid, correctly reflects the requirements, and uses appropriate FFmpeg parameters."
