  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To add blurred bars on the sides of a vertical video and make it 16:9 (widescreen), we can use ffmpeg's filter_complex with the following technique:\n\n- Scale the input video to fit the height of the 16:9 frame.\n- Create a blurred version of the video.\n- Overlay the original (scaled) video onto the blurred background.\n- The blurred background will fill the entire 16:9 area.\n\nAssuming your source video has a vertical aspect ratio (e.g., 9:16), the output size will be height = original video height, and width = height * 16/9.\n\nHere's the command that does it (assuming `story.mov` has height 1080, the width will be 1920 for 16:9):\n\n```\nffmpeg -i story.mov -filter_complex \"\n[0:v]scale=-1:1080, setsar=1 [vscaled];\n[vscaled]boxblur=luma_radius=20:luma_power=1:chroma_radius=20:chroma_power=1, scale=1920:1080 [blurred];\n[blurred][vscaled]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2\n\" -c:a copy output_16_9_story.mov\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `scale=-1:1080` scales the input video to height 1080, width adjusted to keep aspect ratio.\n- `setsar=1` sets the sample aspect ratio to 1 to avoid distortion.\n- The blurred background is created by blurring the scaled video and scaling to full 1920x1080.\n- The original scaled video is overlaid centered on top of the blurred background.\n- Audio is copied as is.\n\nIf your input has a different height, replace 1080 and 1920 accordingly (width = height * 16/9).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output does not contain any fundamental issues as the command appears to fulfill the user's requirement to add blurred bars to make the vertical video a 16:9 widescreen format. The techniques used in the generated command are valid for achieving the desired effect, and it seems well-structured.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the provided failing example. The command produced does not contain any invalid options or incorrect parameters, as was the case with the example of an invalid preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page and does not break any rules regarding the application of options. The usage of `filter_complex`, `scale`, `boxblur`, and `overlay` along with the correct sequencing of input and output parameters is consistent with the FFmpeg guidelines. Thereâ€™s no indication that the options are misapplied or incorrectly ordered.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass as it does not contain any identifiable issues or errors in the command structure, logic, or adherence to FFmpeg documentation."
