  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "For maximum compatibility across all devices (including older phones, browsers, and smart TVs), the safest choices are H.264 for video, AAC for audio, and MP4 container format. Add baseline profile and  yuv420p pixel format for broader support, and use -movflags +faststart for web streaming compatibility.\n\n- `-c:v libx264` – H.264 video encoding.\n- `-profile:v baseline -level 3.0` – ensures compatibility with older devices by disabling advanced features.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` – required for broad device support.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` – AAC audio.\n- `-movflags +faststart` – allows streaming before download finishes.\n- Use `-vf scale=...` only if explicit resizing is needed.\n\nAssumption: Your source audio is stereo, and you do not require resizing. Adjust the input/output filenames as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nReplace `input.ext` with your actual input file. This command will maximize compatibility for virtually all devices in use today.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated correctly uses compatible codecs (H.264 and AAC) and properly specifies parameters for maximum compatibility (such as baseline profile, yuv420p pixel format, and faststart for streaming). The command adheres to user requirements for device compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided failure example. The command includes valid options that exist and are appropriate given the user's request for universal codec support. There are no nonexistent presets or parameters in the command.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page information and the analysis of the command, it does **not** break any requirements. The order of options is appropriate, and the options provided are all valid and compatible with the input and output specified.\n\n4) The model's output does **not** contain the specified issue. It generates a well-formed command that meets the user's request for maximum device compatibility without errors or illegal parameters according to the ffmpeg man page. Thus, the evaluation should conclude that the model performed correctly in this instance."
