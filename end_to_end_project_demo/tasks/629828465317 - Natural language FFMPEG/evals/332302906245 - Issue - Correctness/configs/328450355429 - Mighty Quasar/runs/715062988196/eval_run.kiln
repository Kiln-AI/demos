  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from your input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file (output.mp4), you can use stream specification with `-i` to map those specific streams. Using the same H.264 video and AAC audio codecs ensures broad compatibility. Make sure input streams exist as mapped in your command to avoid errors.\n\nKey points:\n- `-i recording.mov` inputs your main input file.\n- `-map 0:2` selects video stream 0:2 from input file.\n- `-map 1:3` selects audio stream 1:3 from input file (the second input file if batch input is involved, or a \"sidecar\" stream in a format like .m4a). For single input this often just denotes an auxiliary stream; if no second input specified, this refers to stream 1:3 indeed.\n- Copying codecs by default would keep the streams as-is. Use `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` to ensure output matches your requirements, particularly for compatibility.\n- Using `-movflags +faststart` optimizes MP4 files for streaming.\n\nAssuming your audio is already in AAC and your video is H.264, but if itâ€™s different, adjust codecs or do a codec re-encode if necessary.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf the audio stream is not embedded already as 1:3 (for example, from a sidecar audio file like a .m4a), you may want to map that explicitly by adding the appropriate `-i` input for that audio file. But with a single input, this is the approach. Adjust stream indices as needed based on your input files.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue. The command provided does not correctly map the audio stream. The user requested to combine video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3, but the output command mistakenly tries to map audio from stream 0:3 instead of 1:3. This means the command as written would not fulfill the user's requirements correctly, which is a violation of the issue described.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided, which specifically mentions a non-existent `preset extra_fast`. However, it does contain an error in stream mapping, which is a different kind of mistake rather than a syntax error.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page, but it does logically fail by not following the user's specifications for stream mapping correctly.\n\n4) The model's output does contain the issue described. It fails to correctly map the specified audio stream, which is crucial for the command to work as intended. Thus, it should be marked as a fail."
