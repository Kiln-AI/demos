  "input": "I need to compress a video to 500 Mbps bitrate using H.264 encoding for streaming.",
  "output": "To compress a video to a target bitrate of 500 Mbps using H.264 (libx264), you should set the video bitrate accordingly and use parameters that ensure good streaming compatibility. 500 Mbps is very high for most consumer videos; typically bitrates are in the range of a few Mbps to tens of Mbps. Make sure your source and output formats support this rate. For streaming, use -movflags +faststart to place metadata at the beginning, which facilitates better playback over the web.\n\nKey parameters:\n- -c:v libx264: Use H.264 encoding.\n- -b:v 500M: Set video bitrate to 500 megabits per second.\n- -maxrate and -bufsize help control bitrate spikes for constant quality streaming.\n- -c:a aac for AAC audio (widely supported), with a reasonable bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart for smooth streaming.\n- -preset faster or fast for acceptable encoding speed (adjust as needed).\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p for compatibility.\n\nAssumption: You want MP4 output for browser compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 500M -maxrate 500M -bufsize 1000M -preset fast -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output_500Mbps.mp4\n```\n\nThis command ensures your video is encoded to approximately 500 Mbps with H.264, and is optimized for streaming and compatibility. Adjust input and output filenames as needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output meets the user's requirements appropriately. The command generated is correct and should function as intended. The explanation addresses key parameters necessary for compressing the video to a target bitrate of 500 Mbps with H.264 encoding for streaming, along with additional relevant aspects like streaming compatibility and codec selection.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the given failure example. The command provided does not contain any non-existent presets or invalid parameters. All commands and options conform to FFmpeg's specifications as given in the man page.\n\n3) The generated command does not violate any requirements laid out in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the syntax correctly, applies options to the output file, and uses valid parameters such as `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-bufsize`, and `-pix_fmt`, among others.\n\n4) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue_description as it has successfully produced a valid FFmpeg command. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
