  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo create an output.mp4 file using specific video and audio streams (video stream 6 and audio stream 9), use the `-map` option to explicitly select the stream indices. ffmpeg indexes streams starting from 0, so your video stream 6 is the 7th stream (assuming it's video), and audio stream 9 is the 10th stream (assuming it’s audio). You can verify stream types with `ffprobe`.\n\nThe command will:\n- Use `-map 0:v:6` to select video stream 6.\n- Use `-map 0:a:9` to select audio stream 9.\n- Re-encode these streams to match common supported codecs for MP4 compatibility (H.264 + AAC).\n- Use a high-quality H.264/AAC encoder with reasonable defaults for quality and speed.\n\nAssuming you want to copy the audio stream directly (if you're not re-encoding the audio, replace `-c:a aac -b:a 128k` with `-c:a copy` if codec is AAC and compatible). But for broad MP4 compatibility, re-encoding is usually better.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:9 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nIf `ffmpeg -i input.mp4` shows that the streams are not video/audio, adjust accordingly. If streams are referenced by 1-based numbering elsewhere in your tools, subtract 1 (ffmpeg uses 0-based). This command assumes stream 6 is video and stream 9 is audio.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output does not contain a command that is guaranteed to work correctly. While the logic for mapping the streams is correct, it does not account for the possibility that video stream 6 and audio stream 9 are not in the expected format. The command could lead to an error if the streams do not exist or are not of the expected types. Therefore, it has the potential to fail to meet the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNot exactly. The output generated by the model does not contain any outright mistakes or references to non-existent commands. However, it suffers from a logical flaw — it assumes that the specified streams exist and are the correct types without checking first, similar to failing outputs but more subtly. The lack of error checking does put it at risk of generating invalid commands when the inputs provided by the user could result in a failure.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command structure follows the proper syntax outlined in the ffmpeg man page, so it doesn't explicitly break any requirements. However, it relies on the assumption that the stream indices for video and audio are correct. If the user provides incorrect stream indices, the command will fail. There is no logical error in terms of the syntax used, but the assumption about the input's validity is a weakness.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, it does contain the issue described. While the command may be syntactically and structurally correct, it would not reliably fulfill the user’s request without additional validation steps regarding stream integrity, which is crucial for ensuring a working output."
