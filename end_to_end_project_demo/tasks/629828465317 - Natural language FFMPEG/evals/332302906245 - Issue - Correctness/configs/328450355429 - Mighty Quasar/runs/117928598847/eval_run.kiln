  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode `input.mp4` to AVI using the `libvp9` codec with 2-pass encoding, you will need to use the `-pass` option twice, once for the analysis pass and once for the actual encoding. However, note that AVI format does not support the VP9 codec well, and it is more commonly used with formats like MP4 or WebM. If AVI is required, it might be better to use a different container format, but assuming you must use AVI, here is how you can proceed.\n\n- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libvp9`: Sets the video codec to libvp9.\n- `-pass 1`: First pass for analyzing the video and gathering statistics.\n- `-pass 2`: Second pass for actual encoding using the gathered statistics.\n- `-vf scale=1280:720`: Scales the video to 1280x720 resolution (you can adjust this as needed).\n- `-b:v 5M`: Sets the video bitrate to 5 Mbps (adjust according to your needs).\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: Ensures compatibility with most players and containers.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvp9 -pass 1 -vf scale=1280:720 -b:v 5M -pix_fmt yuv420p -f avi - | ffmpeg -i pipe:0 -c:v libvp9 -pass 2 -vf scale=1280:720 -b:v 5M -pix_fmt yuv420p output.avi\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- You are aware that AVI may not be the best container for VP9.\n- The video is to be scaled to 1280x720; if you have specific scaling requirements, they can be adjusted.\n- The `-b:v` parameter is used to control the video bitrate, which can be customized based on the desired quality and file size.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains an issue because the VP9 codec is not well-supported in the AVI container format. The output suggests using the `libvp9` codec, which is primarily recommended for WebM or MP4 formats, not AVI. This could lead to potential playback issues or incompatibilities, thus not matching the user's requirement effectively.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nThe model's output does not exactly match the example of a failing output; however, it does produce a command that can fail or not work correctly due to the context (using `libvp9` with AVI). While the proposed command structure is valid, the use of the codec in this specific container format is questionable and not best practice. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command structure itself does not break any specific requirements in the man page. The use of the `-pass` option alongside `-c:v libvp9` and the other parameters is syntactically correct. However, the recommended practice regarding codec and container compatibility is notably disregarded, as per the man page since codec-specific recommendations suggest that VP9 is better suited with formats like MP4 or WebM, which is a significant point in ensuring accurate output commands.\n\n**Overall Evaluation**: \nThe command produced by the model generates valid syntax but suggests using an incompatible codec with the specified container format (AVI). Thus, it does contain an issue according to the guidelines of using FFmpeg effectively."
