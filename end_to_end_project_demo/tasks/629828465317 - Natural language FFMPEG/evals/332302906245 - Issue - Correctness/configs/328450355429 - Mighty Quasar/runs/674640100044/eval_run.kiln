  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To extract the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from input.mov and create a new media file output.mp4, use the -map option. The -map 0:v:6 selects the 7th video stream (video stream indexing starts at 0, so v:6 is the 7th video track) and -map 0:a:13 selects the 14th audio stream (a:13 is the 14th audio track).\n\nHere’s the recommended ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -i input.mov specifies your input media file.\n- -map 0:v:6 picks the 7th video track.\n- -map 0:a:13 picks the 14th audio track.\n- -c copy bypasses re-encoding, preserving original streams (fast and lossless). If you need transcoding (e.g., for compatibility), replace -c copy with appropriate codecs such as -c:v libx264 for video or -c:a aac for audio.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Your MOV file indeed has at least 7 video streams and 14 audio streams.\n- You want a fast, lossless extraction. If compatibility is critical, let me know, and I can specify codec options.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated is appropriate for the request of mapping the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from the input file. The syntax of the command and options used is correct, which means it should work as expected.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided, since there is no indication of using incorrect or unsupported options—specifically no invalid preset or command that would lead to failure, like `-preset extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It adheres to the rules regarding stream mapping and input/output options.\n\nThus, based on the analysis, the model's output correctly matches the user's request without any issues, including the correct usage of parameters and a valid ffmpeg command. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
