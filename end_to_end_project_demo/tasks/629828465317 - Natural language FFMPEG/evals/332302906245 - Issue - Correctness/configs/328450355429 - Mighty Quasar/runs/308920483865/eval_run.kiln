  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific streams from a media file, you can specify the stream indexes using `-map`. In this case, `0:1` for the second video stream and `0:3` for the fourth audio track. By selecting only these streams and copying their codecs (`-c copy`), you avoid re-encoding, which preserves quality and speeds up the process. \n\nAssuming you want to include both streams in the output mp4 file, use the following command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated successfully matches the user's request, which was to extract specific streams from the input file. The command uses `-map` correctly to select the desired video and audio streams. It also includes `-c copy`, which means there will be no re-encoding, thus maintaining the original quality and speeding up the process. \n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \n   No, the command generated by the model is correct and works according to the user's request. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command does not contain errors and is appropriate for the task.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   No, the command follows all the requirements and conventions laid out in the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   The output does not contain the issue and it passes the evaluation. The command generated is valid and fulfills the user's request."
