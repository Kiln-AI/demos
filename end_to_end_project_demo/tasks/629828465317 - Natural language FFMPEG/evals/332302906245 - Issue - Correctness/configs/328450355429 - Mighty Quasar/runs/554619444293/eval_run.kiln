  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To map only the third audio stream while retaining the original video from `movie.mkv`, use the `-map` option to specify the video and audio streams explicitly. This ensures the third audio track (0:a:2) is selected and the original video stream (0:v:0) is preserved. The command assumes the output container is MKV (default) and copies both streams without re-encoding (if supported). If re-encoding is required, additional parameters can be added.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 output.mkv\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-map 0:v:0`: Selects the first video stream from the input file (index 0).\n- `-map 0:a:2`: Selects the third audio stream (audio streams are 0-indexed, so index 2 is the third track).\n- `output.mkv`: Saves the result in the MKV container (same as the input). Change the extension to `.mp4` or another format if desired, and add codec parameters if copying is not possible.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams as per the user's request. \n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the example of a failing output. The command produced does not reference any non-existent options or incorrect parameters. \n\n3) The command follows the criteria set forth in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses valid stream mapping syntax and the command structure is correct.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and thus it should pass. The command is correct and effectively meets the user's requirements for mapping the third audio stream while keeping the original video unchanged."
