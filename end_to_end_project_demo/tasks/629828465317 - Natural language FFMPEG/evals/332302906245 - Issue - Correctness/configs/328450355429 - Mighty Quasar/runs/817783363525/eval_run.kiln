  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as high-resolution PNG images, use the fps video filter with an output filename pattern. PNG is lossless and suitable for ultra-high quality. Assuming video.avi is already ultra-high resolution, extracted frames will retain the original quality unless further scaling is applied.\n\n- -vf \"fps=1/2\" extracts 1 frame every 2 seconds.\n- %04d.png generates sequential filenames like 0001.png, 0002.png, etc.\n- No scaling is applied, so original resolution is preserved.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=1/2\" %04d.png\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input video is already in ultra-high resolution.\n- The working directory is writable for output images.\n- You want filenames sorted numerically for easy access.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's output step by step based on the criteria provided:\n\n1. **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The command `ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf \"fps=1/2\" %04d.png` correctly extracts frames every 2 seconds from the provided input video file. The output explanation clearly states that the command extracts a frame every 2 seconds while preserving the original quality since it saves the frames as PNG images. Thus, there are no mistakes in the command generation regarding the video extraction specification.\n\n2. **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - The command output is not similar to the failing example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`), as that one contains a nonexistent preset and has other command structure issues. The provided command here is well-structured and makes use of valid FFmpeg command options related to frame extraction.\n\n3. **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command follows the requirements stated in the ffmpeg man page. The options are applied in the correct order, and the command itself is appropriately formatted. The `-vf \"fps=1/2\"` option is correctly used for frame extraction. The output file naming with `%04d.png` is also correctly formatted to specify sequential numbering. Therefore, it does not break any requirements outlined in the man page.\n\n4. **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - No, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command is valid, correctly specifies the user requirements, and follows the formatting and option rules as per the ffmpeg documentation. Therefore, it should pass and is a good output.\n\nOverall, the evaluation confirms that the model's command is appropriate and fulfills the task requirements without any errors."
