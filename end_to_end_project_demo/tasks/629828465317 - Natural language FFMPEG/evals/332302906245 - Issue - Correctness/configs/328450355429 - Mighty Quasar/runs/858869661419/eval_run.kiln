  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from the video every 2 seconds, we'll use the `fscore` filter (formerly known as `fsecurity`) which inserts a score every 2 seconds, and then use the `tfr` filter (taking frames every second) to extract the frames at those scores.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"fscore=d=2, tfr\" -vframes 10 output_%03d.png\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* We assume you want to extract frames at the 2-second mark every second, hence the `d=2` in the `fscore` filter.\n* We use `-vframes 10` to limit the output to 10 frames, as extracting every frame from a 10-second video would result in a very large number of files.\n* We assume the output directory is the current working directory. If it's not, you'll need to provide the full path to the output directory.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command it generated does not use valid `ffmpeg` filters (`fscore` and `tfr` don't exist). Instead, to extract frames every 2 seconds, the `fps` or `select` filter should be used with the appropriate parameters.\n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model will fail because it uses non-existent filters and options. \n\n3) The command breaks the requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It incorrectly uses unnamed and non-existing filters (`fscore` and `tfr`), violating the proper usage of `ffmpeg`.\n\nOverall, the model's output does not meet the user's request as it incorrectly formulates the command using invalid methods. Thus, the evaluation will fail."
