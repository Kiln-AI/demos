  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress video.mov with extremely fast processing, you should use the H.264 codec with FFmpeg’s built-in “ultrafast” preset (commonly referred to for speed), which minimizes compression time at the expense of larger output size. For best compatibility and reasonable compression, also specify AAC for audio. \n\n- -c:v libx264 chooses H.264 video compression.\n- -preset ultrafast uses the fastest encoding preset available.\n- -crf 28 controls output quality (higher = more compression, lower quality). For greater compression while maintaining watchable quality, 28 is a reasonable default for fast workflows.\n- -c:a aac compresses the audio stream.\n- -b:a 128k sets AAC bitrate to 128kbps (standard for good balance).\n- -movflags +faststart ensures the file is streamable if needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart video_compressed.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want a .mp4 output for best compatibility after compression.\n- Quality vs speed tradeoff: “ultrafast” greatly speeds up processing but results in a larger file and lower compression efficiency than slower presets.\n- Adjust CRF (Constant Rate Factor) as needed for your desired quality/file size. Lower number = higher quality, larger file.",

    "chain_of_thought": "To evaluate the model's performance based on the provided input, let's go through the specified steps:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue_description?**\n   The model correctly generates an ffmpeg command that matches the requirements from the user, and the output is coherent with the user request. There are no syntax errors in the command. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure_example?**\n   The output does not resemble the failure example provided. The command generated includes valid parameters and options that do exist, particularly using the correct preset `ultrafast`, which is valid in the ffmpeg context. Hence, it does not match the failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page:\n   - `-c:v libx264` selects a valid video codec.\n   - `-preset ultrafast` uses a valid preset, maximizing speed.\n   - `-crf 28` effectively controls the video quality while allowing for a trade-off with compression.\n   - `-c:a aac` specifies a valid audio codec.\n   - `-b:a 128k` specifies a valid audio bitrate.\n   - `-movflags +faststart` is also a valid option for enabling streaming.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nGiven that the generated command is valid, coherent with user input, and in line with the ffmpeg documentation, it does not contain the issue described. Thus, it should pass. \n\n**Final Evaluation: Pass**"
