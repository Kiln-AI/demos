  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "To set specific bitrates for audio and video streams, use the `-b:a` (audio bitrate) and `-b:v` (video bitrate) options.\n\nHowever, note:\n- A video bitrate of 100 Gbps (100,000,000 kbps) is extremely highâ€”well beyond professional or practical use, and most encoders/hardware will not handle it. You may instead want \"100 Mbps\" (100,000 kbps) for extremely high quality. If you're certain about 100 Gbps, ffmpeg will accept it as `100G` or `100000000k`, but this is not realistic for most workflows.\n- AAC encoder may not support 500k audio bitrate by default; you may use it if compatibility is not a concern.\n\nHere is how you set those bitrates:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 100G -c:a aac -b:a 500k output.mp4\n```\n\n- Replace `input.ext` with your source file.\n- `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 encoder for video.\n- `-b:v 100G` sets video bitrate to 100 gigabits per second.\n- `-c:a aac` and `-b:a 500k` set audio codec to AAC and bitrate to 500 kbps.\n\n**Assumptions:** You specifically want 100 Gbps (not Mbps), and you want to force the encoder to use these settings for maximum theoretical quality, not practical use. If you wanted 100 Mbps, change `100G` to `100M`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The command specifies setting a video bitrate of 100 Gbps, which is not practical and exceeds typical capabilities of encoders or playback hardware. Additionally, while it mentions the potential incompatibility of the AAC encoder with a 500 kbps audio bitrate, it does not provide a command that is guaranteed to work in all situations.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example provided in the failure example. The example indicates a mistake in a non-existing option; however, while the model's output generates a command using existing options, it fails to correctly handle the specified bitrate values, particularly the impracticality of 100 Gbps.\n\n3) The command does not break any specific requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. However, the use of a 100 Gbps bitrate is highly unrealistic, and while it technically works in ffmpeg syntax, it does not align with common use cases or practical applications in the field of media encoding.\n\n4) Given the above evaluation steps, the model's output does indeed contain issues, particularly regarding the practicality of the bitrate settings. Therefore, it should be marked as a fail."
