  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode (burn) yellow subtitles from an SRT file into a video, you can use the `subtitles` filter with the `force_style` option to set the subtitle color. The color must be in hexadecimal BGR format (yellow is `&H00FFFF`).\n\n- `-vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF'\"` applies the subtitles filter with yellow color.\n- The output video will have the subtitles permanently burned in.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis assumes your `movie.mkv` has an audio stream you want to copy directly without re-encoding (`-c:a copy`). Adjust codecs if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command provided correctly implements the functionality to hardcode subtitles into the video while specifying the color as yellow. It appropriately uses the `subtitles` filter and the `force_style` option.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain any invalid or non-existent options; it correctly uses the `force_style` option with a valid hexadecimal representation for yellow color.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly specifies options for both the input and output files in the right order, and the options used (like `-vf` and `-c:a copy`) conform to the requirements described in the man page.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does NOT contain the issue described. It successfully meets the task requirements by generating a working ffmpeg command without any apparent errors or misconfigurations."
