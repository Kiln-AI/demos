  "input": "Create a 'matrix' style video from `input.mp4` by changing the color so it's all green and black.",
  "output": "To create a \"Matrix\" style effect where the video is tinted entirely green and black, you can use the `colorchannelmixer` filter in ffmpeg. This filter allows you to adjust how much of each RGB channel is present in the output. For a classic Matrix effect, keep only the green channel and suppress red and blue, effectively giving the video a green monochrome appearance. \n\nHereâ€™s how to do it:\n\n- `colorchannelmixer=rr=0:rg=0:rb=0:gr=0:gg=1:gb=0:br=0:bg=0:bb=0` keeps only the green channel.\n- You may also consider bumping the contrast or lowering brightness for even starker black/green visuals (but here's a basic approach).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"colorchannelmixer=rr=0:rg=0:rb=0:gr=0:gg=1:gb=0:br=0:bg=0:bb=0\" output_matrix.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want an even more stylized look (darker blacks, more vibrant green), add the eq filter:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"colorchannelmixer=rr=0:rg=0:rb=0:gr=0:gg=1.5:gb=0:br=0:bg=0:bb=0,eq=contrast=1.3:brightness=-0.05\" output_matrix.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: You want a basic green tint (monochrome green). The original audio is preserved.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The ffmpeg command it generated utilizes valid syntax and appropriate filters to achieve the desired effect of creating a \"Matrix\" style video with green and black colors. The command is logically constructed, adheres to the expected input and output specifications, and applies the filters correctly to modify the video's visual characteristics.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated by the model uses valid options and filters. The syntax does not contain erroneous or non-existent options like the failure example.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command generated does not break any requirements. All filters and parameters used in the command are valid and applicable according to the documentation. The use of the `colorchannelmixer` filter and the `eq` filter are both correctly implemented and are acceptable for modifying the video as intended.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it passes the evaluation. The command properly constructs an ffmpeg invocation that aligns with the user's requirements to create a green and black \"Matrix\" style video from the specified input file."
