  "input": "Convert my video using a bitrate of 25000k for video and 320k for audio to balance quality and size.",
  "output": "To convert your video with a video bitrate of 25,000 kbps (25 Mbps) and an audio bitrate of 320 kbps, specify these bitrates directly using the `-b:v` (video bitrate) and `-b:a` (audio bitrate) options. This provides you with a good balance between quality and file size.\n\nAssuming you want to output a standard MP4 file with H.264 video and AAC audio (compatible with most players):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- Replace `input.ext` with your input filename.\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the H.264 video encoder.\n- `-b:v 25000k` sets the video bitrate to 25,000 kbps.\n- `-c:a aac` selects the AAC audio encoder.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart` is optional but recommended for better streaming support.\n\nLet me know if you want different output formats or codecs!",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to be valid for the task at hand, as it specifies both video and audio bitrates correctly and utilizes valid codec options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command within the model's output (`ffmpeg -i input.ext -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4`) does not contain any nonexistent options or parameters, unlike the failure example that had a nonexistent preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used in the model's output correspond correctly to the described behavior, follow the required order of input/output options, and utilize appropriate bitrates and codecs.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the task instruction to ensure that the command generated works correctly and matches the user's requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation based on all criteria."
