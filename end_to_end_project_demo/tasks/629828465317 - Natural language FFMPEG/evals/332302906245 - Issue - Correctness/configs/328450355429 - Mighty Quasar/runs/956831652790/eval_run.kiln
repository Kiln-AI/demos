  "output": "To select the third video stream (`-map 0:v:2`) and the second audio stream (`-map 0:a:1`) from the source file `multi.avi` and map them into the output file `final.mp4`, you can use the following command.\n\nWe'll use the `-c` option to select codecs. In this example, we are copying the selected streams without re-encoding, using `-c:v copy` for video and `-c:a copy` for audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes that the third video stream and the second audio stream from `multi.avi` are compatible with the MP4 container.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command correctly matches the user's requirements for mapping the third video stream and the second audio stream from the source file into a single output file. The command utilizes correct options for mapping videos and audio streams, and specifies to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The provided command is valid and makes use of correct syntax and options associated with `ffmpeg`. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-map`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a` options adheres to the specifications and logic found in the man page. It correctly specifies the input for mapping as `0:v:2` for the third video stream and `0:a:1` for the second audio stream, and the use of `copy` suggests that there is no need for re-encoding, which is permitted.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain the issue identified in the issue description. The command was adequately expressed and accurately fulfilled the user's requirements. It should be considered to have passed the evaluation."
