  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack the video `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4` vertically, you need to use the `vstack` filter. This filter combines two input streams into a single output arranged vertically. For best results, the videos should have the same width and frame rate; typically, both are compressed with the same codec and basic characteristics.\n\nBelow is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"vstack\" stacked.mp4\n```\n\nThis will stack `top_video.mp4` above `bottom_video.mp4` and save the result as `stacked.mp4`. If the videos have different widths, consider using the `pad`, `scale`, or `xstack` filters to ensure vertical alignment. But with standard inputs, `vstack` is the simplest way.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct and follows the task requirements specified by the user: it effectively stacks two videos vertically using the `vstack` filter as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command produced by the model (`ffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"vstack\" stacked.mp4`) is valid and utilizes existing and appropriate ffmpeg options. There is no incorrect option similar to `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct syntax and options for stacking videos using the `-filter_complex` flag and the `vstack` filter.\n\n4) Therefore, based on the analysis above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, and it can be considered to have successfully completed the task."
