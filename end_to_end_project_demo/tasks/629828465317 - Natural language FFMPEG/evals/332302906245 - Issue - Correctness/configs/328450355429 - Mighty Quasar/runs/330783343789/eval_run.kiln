  "input": "I need to compress my video.mov file using the hyper preset for extremely fast processing.",
  "output": "To compress your video.mov file using the \"hyper\" preset for extremely fast processing, I'll use `ffmpeg` with the `libx264` encoder and the \"hyper\" preset. This prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, so the output file size might be larger than with slower presets.\n\n- `libx264` is a popular and efficient H.264 video encoder.\n- `hyper` is the fastest encoding preset.\n- `-crf 23` sets a constant rate factor for quality (23 is a good starting point, lower values mean higher quality).\n- `c:a copy` copies the audio stream from the input to the output without re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mov -c:v libx264 -preset hyper -crf 23 -c:a copy compressed_video.mov\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated by the model is correct and does not violate any ffmpeg command requirements. It uses the `libx264` codec, specifies the `hyper` preset correctly, and handles audio stream copying with `c:a copy`. \n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command does not include a non-existent preset (like `extra_fast`), and all parameters used are valid within the context.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options are used properly and in the correct order, and there are no violated syntax rules.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output is valid and does not contain any issues. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
