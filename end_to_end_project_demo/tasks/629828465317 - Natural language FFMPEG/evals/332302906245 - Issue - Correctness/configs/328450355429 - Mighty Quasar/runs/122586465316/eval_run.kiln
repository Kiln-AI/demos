  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles to your video while removing any existing subtitle tracks, you'll need to use the `subtitles` filter for adding the external subtitle file and the `-map` option to specify which streams to keep. The `-sn` option alone will suppress *display* of subtitles, but it does not remove the streams.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the command and its components:\n\n-   `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file.\n-   `-i subtitles.srt`: Specifies the external subtitle file (assuming it's in SRT format; adapt if using another format like ASS or WebVTT).\n-   `-map 0`: Includes all streams from the first input file (the video).\n-   `-map 1`: Includes all streams from the second input file (the subtitles).\n-   `-c copy`: Specifies that all streams which are copied are copied without re-encoding.\n-   `-c:s mov_text`: Assigns the mov\\_text codec to the added subtitle stream. This is commonly compatible with MP4 containers. If your input file is MKV, a better option would be `srt`.\n-   `-disposition:s:0 default`: Flags the first subtitle stream (index 0 among subtitle streams) as the default subtitle stream.  This is optional, but can be useful if you want the added subtitles to be enabled by default in players that support this flag.\n-   `\"subtitles=subtitles.srt\"`: Applies the subtitles filter.  Adjust this path to reflect the actual location of your subtitles file.\n-   `output.mp4`: Specifies the output video file name.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0 -map 1 -c copy -c:s mov_text -disposition:s:0 default -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\" output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue. The command it generated does not effectively remove existing subtitle tracks. It only adds the new subtitle track while still retaining any existing ones. The user specifically requested to remove existing subtitle tracks, which is not accomplished in this output.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output is not similar to the failure example, as it does not output an obviously incorrect command. The command being produced, while it has issues with the user requirements, is structurally correct and would not cause a failure based on syntax or nonexistent options. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not technically break any requirements from the man page. However, it does not meet the specific user requirement to \"remove all existing subtitle tracks,\" which could lead to an output that does not fulfill the user's intent effectively. The generated command structure follows the syntax, but semantic requirements regarding subtitle tracks are not met.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model fails to meet the user's requirements as it does not remove existing subtitles while adding new ones. Therefore, it should be marked as a fail in this evaluation context."
