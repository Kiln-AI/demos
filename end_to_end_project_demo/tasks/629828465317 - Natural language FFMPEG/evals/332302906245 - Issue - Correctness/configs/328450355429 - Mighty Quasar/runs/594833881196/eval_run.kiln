  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To convert your video file with a constant bitrate of 25000 kbps, you can use the following `ffmpeg` command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input file is `input.avi`.\n* You want to use the H.264 video codec.\n* You want to set the constant bitrate of the video stream to 25000 kbps (or 25 Mbps).\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `-c:v libx264` specifies the H.264 video codec.\n* `-b:v 25000k` sets the constant bitrate of the video stream to 25000 kbps.\n* The output file will be saved as `output.mp4`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command `ffmpeg -i input.avi -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k output.mp4` should work correctly to set a constant video bitrate of 25000 kbps using the H.264 codec. The command matches the user's requirement for a constant bitrate.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The command provided does not contain any invalid parameters or options -- every part of it adheres to the proper syntax that `ffmpeg` expects.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options are correctly applied to the input and output files according to the `ffmpeg` command syntax, and the parameters for specifying codecs and bitrates are valid.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble a failing output, and complies with the `ffmpeg` man page requirements. Therefore, the model's output should pass this evaluation."
