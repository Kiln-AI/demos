  "output": "To extract specific streams from a multi-stream file, you can use the `-map` option to specify which streams to include in the output. Assuming the video stream you want is the second stream (0:1) and the audio track you want is the fourth stream (0:3), you can use the following command:\n\nThe `-map` option is used to specify which streams to include in the output. `0:1` refers to the second stream (0-indexed) of the input file `input.avi`, and `0:3` refers to the fourth stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy result.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions made:\n\n* The second stream (0:1) is a video stream and the fourth stream (0:3) is an audio stream.\n* You want to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is why `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` are used. If you want to re-encode the streams, you can replace `copy` with the desired codec (e.g., `-c:v libx264` for H.264 video).",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description section. The generated command seems correct for the task of extracting specific streams from the input file without any encoding issues or syntax errors.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced is correct and does not use any non-existent options or invalid syntax like the `extra_fast` preset.\n\n3) The command in the model's output does **not** break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the syntax and rules associated with using the `-map` option correctly to specify which streams to include in the output, and it uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` correctly to indicate that it should directly copy the streams without re-encoding them.\n\n4) Based on the evaluations in steps 1, 2, and 3, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the evaluation criterion. Therefore, it **passes** the evaluation."
