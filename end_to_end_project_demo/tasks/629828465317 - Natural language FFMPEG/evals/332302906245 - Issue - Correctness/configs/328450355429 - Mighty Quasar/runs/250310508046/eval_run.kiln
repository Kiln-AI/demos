  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo hardcode subtitles into the video, you can load the external subtitle file and burn the rendered subtitles directly onto the video frames. For colored subtitles (e.g., yellow), use the `ass` subtitle format, which allows for styling. Here's how to proceed:\n\n1. Convert the `.srt` file to `.ass` (Advanced SubStation Alpha) to include the yellow color and other styling. You can do this manually or via command-line tools like `ffmpeg` or using a subtitle editor like Aegisub.\n2. Use the `subtitles` filter with the converted `.ass` file, specifying the video burn action to permanently embed the subtitles in the video.\n\nAssuming you want to use the `subtitles` filter and have `subtitles.ass` ready with yellow color styling, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitles=force_style='PrimaryColour=0xffff00' -c:a copy hardcoded_output.mkv\n```\n\nHowever, if you already have a `.srt` file and want to apply yellow subtitle color without pre-conversion, the workflow is:\n\n1. Convert `.srt` to `.ass` with yellow foreground color:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i subtitles.srt -map 0:s:0 subs.ass\n```\n\n2. Then burn the `.ass` file onto the video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitle=subs.ass -c:a copy hardcoded.mkv\n```\n\nThis example uses the simpler workaround of using `ffmpeg` and a pre-styled `.srt` as input to generate the styled `.ass` and burn it. Here's a more controlled method using manual `.ass` styling (assumes you have a `.ass` file with yellow text):\n\n```bash\n# Example ffmpeg command to burn the pre-styled subs.ass file\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf subtitles=subs.ass -c:a copy output_with_yellow_subtitles.mkv\n```\n\nThis method permanently hardcodes the yellow subtitle stream directly into the video stream, producing a clean output.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains an issue described in the issue description: Even though the model correctly outlines a process for hardcoding subtitles into a video, the suggested commands may not work correctly based on the requirements. Specifically, the command used might not produce yellow subtitles unless the `.ass` file is properly formatted or created. The output also suggests converting the `.srt` file to an `.ass` file without providing clear instructions for creating that specific yellow formatting in the `.ass` file, which can lead to confusion and incorrect implementation. The idea of using `force_style` is correct, but the proper conversion process is not fully detailed, and the second command itself may result in an output that does not guarantee yellow subtitles. Therefore, the output contains issues according to the requirements.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output in that the commands do not contain obvious syntax errors or non-existent options. However, it can lead to failure based on incorrect assumptions about the conversion of subtitles if the user does not implement the steps as described. Hence, while it isnâ€™t a blatant failure example, it still could lead to incorrect results.\n\n3) The model's command does not break any clear requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page based on the provided ffmpeg command syntax. The options used with `-vf` for handling subtitles follow the proper syntax. However, the execution of those commands can lead to issues since the command does not guarantee yellow subtitles unless the preceding processes are followed correctly.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output contains the issue described, as it leads to potential incorrect results and does not meet the user's explicit requirements for producing yellow hardcoded subtitles. Therefore, it should fail based on those criteria, despite being syntactically correct."
