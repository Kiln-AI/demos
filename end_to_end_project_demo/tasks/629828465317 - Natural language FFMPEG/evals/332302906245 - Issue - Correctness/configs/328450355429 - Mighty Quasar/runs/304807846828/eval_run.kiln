  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction (e.g., the \"temporal\" filter), spatial denoising (e.g., the \"boxblur\" filter), and edge enhancement (e.g., the \"emboss\" filter) in a specified order, you need to properly chain the filters using the format `filter1:option1=param1:option2=param2...`\nFilters must be applied in the requested sequence by using the `-vf` option with a filter chain that concatenates the filters one after another, separated by commas. \n\nFor example:\n\n- **Temporal noise reduction with \"temporal\" filter** (assuming you want to reduce temporal noise over multiple frames):\n  The \"temporal\" filter performs motion-adaptive noise reduction.\n\n- **Spatial denoising with \"boxblur\" filter** (a simple spatial blur denoiser for noise reduction):\n  A single-element blur, which can be adjusted for balance between denoising and sharpness.\n\n- **Edge enhancement with \"emboss\" filter** (an edge detector that enhances contrast along edges):\n  This filter sharpens edges and emphasizes contrast.\n\nIf you want to apply motion-adaptive temporal noise reduction first, followed by light spatial denoising, and then edge enhancement, your filter chain will look like this:\n\n```bash\n-vf \"temporal=format=yuva444,boxblur=7:7,emboss\"\n```\n\n***Parameter interpretation:***\n\n- `temporal=format=yuva444`: Applies temporal noise reduction. The format parameter helps maintain color information.\n- `boxblur=7:7`: Blurs the image spatially (7x7 kernel), good for reducing noise.\n- `emboss`: Enhances edges by simulating embossing, which also helps edge detection and sharpening.\n\n***Assumptions:***\n\n- You have a standard input file (e.g., input.mp4).\n- You want to enable strong noise reduction by using `boxblur` parameters like 7x7.\n- The order is temporal -> spatial (box blur) -> edge enhancement.\n\nThis chain efficiently balances noise reduction, edge detection, and sharpness in the output.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"temporal=format=yuva444,boxblur=7:7,emboss\" output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is appropriate for applying a filter chain for temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement in FFmpeg. The command seems well-formed and matches the userâ€™s requirements. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The provided command is not incorrect; it follows the required syntax for filter application in FFmpeg. It effectively describes the usage of the filters in the correct order and structure, which stands in contrast to the example where an invalid preset was mentioned.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command generated adheres to the syntax and requirements detailed in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly uses the `-vf` option for video filters and specifies filters in a comma-separated format, which is consistent with the expectations outlined within FFmpeg documentation. The options used in the filters also align with the parameters described in the man page, and no erroneous elements are present in the command that would break any requirements.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n**No, the model's output does not contain the described issue.** The command generated is valid and appropriate for the task asked by the user."
