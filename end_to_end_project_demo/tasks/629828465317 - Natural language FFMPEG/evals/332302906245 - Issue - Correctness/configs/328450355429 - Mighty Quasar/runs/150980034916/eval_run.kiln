  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a source file using ffmpeg, you can use the -map option. This allows selecting exact stream indices:\n\n- stream 2 is zero-based, so third video stream is stream 2\n- stream 1 is second audio stream is stream 1\n\nThe command takes these streams and remuxes them into a new MP4 container. If re-encoding is not necessary, you can copy streams with -c copy for lossless remuxing. \n\nAssuming that streams are compatible (e.g., video codec is supported by MP4), here's the recommended command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis:\n\n- Selects the third video stream and second audio stream from input 0\n- Copies the streams without re-encoding (-c copy) for speed and quality preservation\n- Outputs to final.mp4\n\nIf the codecs or container compatibility is an issue, slight re-encoding might be needed, but for precise stream mapping and remuxing, this approach is best.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select the desired streams from the input file and utilizes `-c copy` for lossless remuxing. This aligns with the user's request to map specific video and audio streams from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The generated command (`ffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4`) is correctly formatted and logically coherent, while the example of a failing output contains an incorrect option related to an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` option is used correctly to select the third video and second audio streams, and `-c copy` is appropriate for copying streams without re-encoding when their formats are compatible with the output container. The stream selection and copying functionalities comply with the guidelines outlined in the man page.\n\n4) As the output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the failure example, and conforms to the requirements set by the man page, it should pass. Therefore, the model's output is effective and correct for the given task."
