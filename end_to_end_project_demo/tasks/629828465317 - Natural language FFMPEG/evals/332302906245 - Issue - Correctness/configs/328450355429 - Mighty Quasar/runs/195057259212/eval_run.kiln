  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To extract the 7th video stream (index 6) and the 14th audio stream (index 13) from `input.mov` and combine them into a single output file, use the `-map` option to specify the exact streams. FFmpeg uses 0-based indexing, so the 7th video stream is at index `6` and the 14th audio stream is at index `13`. The `-c copy` flag avoids re-encoding, preserving the original codecs and quality. However, this requires the output format to support those codecs.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- The input file contains at least 7 video streams and 14 audio streams.  \n- The output format (e.g., `output.mp4`) supports the original codecs of the selected streams. If not, re-encoding may be needed.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 6:v -map 13:a -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output appears to address the user's request accurately. It specifies the correct usage of the `-map` option with appropriate indices for the streams, includes the `-c copy` flag to avoid re-encoding, and provides an output file format that supports copy (assuming it's an MP4 file). Thus, it successfully generates a command that is expected to work as intended, meeting the user's requirements, and hence does not contain the described issue.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output provided by the model does not resemble the failure example where an incorrect preset is specified. The command generated by the model correctly uses the `-map` option and the `-c copy` command, both of which are valid and correctly applied according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The output command is correctly formatted, uses valid options that comply with the specifications in the man page, and uses existing stream mappings.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe output should pass as it does not contain the described issue, given that the command is correctly formed and meets the user's request."
