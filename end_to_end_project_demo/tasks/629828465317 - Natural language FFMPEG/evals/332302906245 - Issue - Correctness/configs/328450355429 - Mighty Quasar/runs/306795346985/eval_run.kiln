  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from your video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution, we'll use the `fps` filter to specify the frame extraction interval and the `scale` filter to maintain or upscale the resolution (using the `force_original` assumption unless a target resolution is specified). Here’s the breakdown:\n\n- `-vf fps=1/2` extracts a frame every 2 seconds (1/2 of a frame per second).\n- `-vf scale=original_width:original_height` ensures the resolution fits the source or can be adjusted to desired maximum.\n- `image2` is the default format for saving images.\n- `output_%04d.png` will save the frames with numbered filenames to avoid overwriting.\n\n**Assumptions made:**\n- \"Ultra high resolution\" is interpreted as no downscaling (i.e., original resolution).\n- The output files will be numbered sequentially as `output_0001.png`, `output_0002.png`, etc.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 -c:v png output_%04d.png\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue as it generates a command that is both appropriate for the user input and should work correctly. The command `ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 -c:v png output_%04d.png` is valid and effectively captures a frame every 2 seconds and saves it in PNG format as specified.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The command generated is syntactically correct and uses valid options available within FFmpeg.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command adheres to the specifications detailed in the FFmpeg man page. It specifies the input file using `-i`, applies a video filter to extract frames every 2 seconds using `-vf fps=1/2`, and uses `-c:v png` to set the output codec to PNG. The sequential output naming format `output_%04d.png` is also valid as per the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue, therefore it **passes**. The command is correctly formed, matches the user’s requirements, and aligns with the standards set forth in the FFmpeg man page."
