  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC using ffmpegâ€™s experimental encoder, while applying noise reduction, you can use the `-map a` option to extract only the audio stream and `-c:a flac -strict experimental` for FLAC encoding (note: as of recent ffmpeg versions the FLAC encoder is stable, so `-strict experimental` may not be necessary). For noise reduction, ffmpeg provides the `afftdn` (FFT DeNoise) audio filter which is suitable for general noise reduction.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The video file contains a single audio track.\n- Reasonable default noise reduction is acceptable (afftdn without special tuning).\n\n- `-i video.mp4`: Input file.\n- `-map a`: Map only audio streams.\n- `-af afftdn`: Apply the FFT DeNoise filter.\n- `-c:a flac -strict experimental`: Use the FLAC audio codec with experimental flag (if needed).\n- `output.flac`: Output file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map a -af afftdn -c:a flac -strict experimental output.flac\n```\n\nIf your ffmpeg does not require the `-strict experimental` flag for FLAC, you can omit it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map a -af afftdn -c:a flac output.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues described in the issue description. The command generated appears to correctly execute the user's request of extracting audio from a video file and saving it as FLAC along with applying noise reduction. It follows the ffmpeg command line structure appropriately.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model uses valid options and parameters according to the ffmpeg syntax and does not include any non-existent options like `-preset extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (like `-map a`, `-af afftdn`, `-c:a flac`) are legitimate and conform to the expected syntax for extracting audio and applying filters in ffmpeg. The addition of `-strict experimental` is noted as potentially unnecessary based on recent versions of ffmpeg, which is a reasonable explanation.\n\n4) Therefore, since the output is syntactically correct, follows the requirements, and matches the user's request, it should pass all evaluations without issues."
