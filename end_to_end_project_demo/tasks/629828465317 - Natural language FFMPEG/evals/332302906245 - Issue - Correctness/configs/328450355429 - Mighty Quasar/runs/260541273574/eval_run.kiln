  "input": "I want to use a video bitrate of 15000k and audio bitrate of 320k for my project.",
  "output": "To set your video bitrate to 15000 kbps and your audio bitrate to 320 kbps, use the -b:v and -b:a parameters, respectively.\n\n- -b:v 15000k: Sets the average video bitrate to 15 Mbps. This parameter is most effective when used with a constant rate factor (CRF) such as in x264/libx264. If you want a true CBR encode, add -maxrate 15000k -bufsize (15000k*2) as per x264 documentation.\n- -b:a 320k: Sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- -c:v libx264 and -c:a aac are example codecs widely used.\n- -movflags +faststart moves metadata for fast streaming in the MP4 container.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- You are producing an MP4 file (which is common), but you can change the container as needed.\n- You’re using H.264 for video and AAC for audio—adjust codec names if different are required.\n\nHere is a command that sets both video and audio bitrates explicitly:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 15000k -maxrate 15000k -bufsize 30000k -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\nThis command will ensure your video is encoded with an average bitrate of 15 Mbps and your audio at 320 kbps, which is suitable for projects requiring high-quality results at these specific bitrates.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is well-structured and correctly uses the parameters needed to set both the video and audio bitrates as requested by the user.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not reference any incorrect options or non-existent presets. All parameters used are valid within the ffmpeg context.\n\n3) After reviewing the ffmpeg man page and the generated command, it does not break any requirements. The command correctly applies options to the output file after specifying the input file. All options such as `-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` are used appropriately, adhering to the expected syntax and functionality described in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation criteria, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should be marked as passing the evaluation."
