  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The output does not include any valid ffmpeg command or options pertaining to the user's request of hardcoding subtitles into a video. Instead, the output is nonsensical and lacks any coherent command structure or relevant information, therefore failing to meet the requirements posed by the user.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nYes, the model's output is similar to the failing output example provided. Just as the example fail has an incorrect or nonsensical command, the current output does not provide any functional ffmpeg command that would address the user's request.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThere is no valid ffmpeg command in the output to assess against the man page requirements. Since the output is completely devoid of appropriate syntax or command structure, it cannot adhere to or violate any specified requirements in the ffmpeg man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue.**\nThe model's output fails as it does contain the issue describedâ€”it does not generate a valid ffmpeg command that fulfills the user's requirements for hardcoding subtitles in the specified format."
