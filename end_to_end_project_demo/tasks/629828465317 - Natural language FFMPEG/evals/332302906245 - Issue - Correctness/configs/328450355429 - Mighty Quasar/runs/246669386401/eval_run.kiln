  "input": "I need to encode this video with 8000k video bitrate and 512k audio bitrate.",
  "output": "To encode the video with constant bitrates of 8000 kb/s for video and 512 kb/s for audio, we'll use CBR encoding. For H.264, this requires setting `-b:v` (video bitrate) to 8000k and `-b:a` (audio bitrate) to 512k with appropriate audio codec settings.\n\n- `-b:v 8000k` sets video bitrate to 8000 kb/s\n- `-b:a 512k` sets audio bitrate to 512 kb/s\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 video codec\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC audio codec\n- We'll use the default AAC settings for compatibility\n\nAssumptions: Input is `input.mp4` and output should be `output.mp4`. If you need a different container/codec combination, adjust accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 8000k -c:a aac -b:a 512k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command correctly sets the required bitrates for both the video and audio streams and uses appropriate codecs (`libx264` for video and `aac` for audio). \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command does not use any invalid presets or options, and it properly applies the options to the specified input and output files. The command also correctly specifies the `-b:v` and `-b:a` options for bitrate settings.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The order of options applied to the specified input file follows the correct syntax, and the codecs and bitrate options used are valid. The command adheres to the expected syntax and semantics defined in the man page. \n\n4) Since the model's output is accurate and does not exhibit any issues, it passes the evaluation. The command is constructed correctly for the user's request and is within the expected usage of ffmpeg as per the documentation."
