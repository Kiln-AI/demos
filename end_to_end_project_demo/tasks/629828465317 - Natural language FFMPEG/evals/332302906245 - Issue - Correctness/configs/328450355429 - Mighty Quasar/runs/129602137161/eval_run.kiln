  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the third video stream and second audio stream from `multi.avi` and encode them into a compatible MP4 file, we use `-map` to explicitly select the streams by their zero-indexed number. `-map 0:v:2` chooses the third video stream (0=index of input, v=video stream, 2=index of the third stream), and `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream. For MP4 compatibility, encode to H.264 video and AAC audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac final.mp4\n```\n\nKey assumptions:\n- Input file `multi.avi` contains at least 3 video streams and 2 audio streams (inputs are zero-indexed but \"third\" and \"second\" are referred to in human counting).\n- No specific video/audio parameters (like encoding speed or quality) were requested, so standard FFmpeg defaults for libx264 and aac codecs are used.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated `ffmpeg` command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file `multi.avi` to the output file `final.mp4`, aligning with the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and follows the structure expected by `ffmpeg`, whereas the failure example includes a reference to a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly uses stream mapping options (`-map 0:v:2` and `-map 0:a:1`), and there are no syntactic errors. The codecs specified (H.264 for video using `libx264` and AAC for audio using `aac`) are also valid options supported by `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) Since the command adheres to the requirements, does not generate errors, and satisfies the user's request, the model's output should pass the evaluation. It effectively generates a valid command to achieve the desired outcome without any issues."
