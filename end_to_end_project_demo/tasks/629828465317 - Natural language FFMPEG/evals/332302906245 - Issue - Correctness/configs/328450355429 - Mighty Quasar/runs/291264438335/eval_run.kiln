  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode `input.mp4` to an AVI file using the libvpx-vp9 codec with 2-pass encoding, we will perform a two-step process. First, we generate the pass1 and pass2 files, and then we use these files to produce the final AVI video.\n\n- The `-b:v` option specifies the video bitrate as 2 MiB/s for each pass.\n- The `-tag:v` option sets the video codec tag to `vp9` for VP9 codec.\n- Passing `pass=1` to the second command indicates the first pass, during which it collects encoding statistics.\n- Passing `pass=2` to the third command uses the collected information to produce the final video.\n- The `-an` flag disables audio encoding during pass1 to avoid corruption of the pass1 file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vlibvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 1 -an -f webm pass1.webm\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vlibvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 2 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p output.avi\n```\n\nNote: The output format for the first pass is set to `webm` as a holding format since VP9 is not directly supported by AVI. The second pass then uses the generated pass1 statistics to generate the final output.avi file. If you specifically need the output in AVI format despite the codecs, you may need to use mkvtoolnix or a similar tool to convert the webm file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Evaluate the output for issues as described:**\n   The command output produced by the model has a significant issue. The codec used (`libvp9`, accessed via `libvpx-vp9`) is not supported in the AVI container format, which violates the user's requirement to transcode to AVI using the VP9 codec. Therefore, the output can be considered incorrect because the AVI format does not accommodate VP9 encoding. The model should instead convert the video using a codec like `mpeg4` or `libxvid` that is compatible with the AVI format.\n\n2) **Compare similar examples of failure:**\n   The output differs from the provided failure example since the syntax of the ffmpeg commands is generally correct. The issues arise from using an incompatible codec with the chosen file format instead of incorrect flags or nonexistent parameters.\n\n3) **Break requirements dictated in the man page:**\n   Based on the man page, it is clear that while FFmpeg is quite flexible and can handle a variety of codecs and containers, there are compatibility requirements that must be met. The use of `libvpx-vp9` in the AVI output violates the standard described in the man page, as AVI does not support VP9 in any standard manner.\n\n4) **Conclusion:**\n   The model's output does contain an issue as it does not work correctly with the specified input (AVI format) while trying to use an unsupported codec (VP9). Thus, the output fails to meet the requirements from the user."
