  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the first video stream and the third audio stream, you can specify stream selection with `-map`. This way, only the desired streams are included in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream.\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (indexing from zero).\n- The output is in MP4 format, compatible with most players.\n\nAssuming the desired streams are the first video and the third audio:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` avoid re-encoding, preserving original quality. If re-encoding is needed for compatibility, specify codecs accordingly.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately reflects the userâ€™s requirements to extract the first video stream and the third audio stream from the file `movie.mkv` into a new file `final.mp4`. It correctly uses the `-map` option to specify the desired streams and employs `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to preserve the original quality, which is appropriate given the context.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not contain any invalid or incorrect parameters. In fact, it adheres to the correct format and appropriately uses valid ffmpeg options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It uses valid syntax for specifying input files, mapping streams, and encoding audio and video streams. The parameters used are compliant with the described functionalities.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, the output should pass the evaluation."
