  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames every 2 seconds from video.avi and save them as high-resolution PNG images, I'll use the fps filter to sample at 0.5 fps (1 frame every 2 seconds) and PNG codec for lossless compression.\n\n- `-vf fps=0.5` extracts one frame every 2 seconds (0.5 frames per second)\n- `-c:v png` uses PNG codec for lossless, high-quality images\n- `-compression_level 1` sets PNG compression (0=fastest/largest, 9=slowest/smallest; 1 gives good balance)\n- `frame_%04d.png` creates sequentially numbered files (frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, etc.)\n\nThe output resolution will match your source video's resolution. If you need to upscale beyond the source resolution, you can add a scale filter, but this won't truly increase detail - it will just interpolate pixels.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=0.5 -c:v png -compression_level 1 frame_%04d.png\n```\n\nNote: \"Ultra high resolution\" is preserved from your source video. If you want to upscale (though this won't add real detail), you could add `-vf \"fps=0.5,scale=3840:2160\"` to force 4K resolution, but the quality improvement would be artificial.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command accurately extracts frames every 2 seconds from the specified video file and saves them as PNG images, which aligns with the userâ€™s request for high-resolution outputs. The command is syntactically correct and corresponds to the functionalities of ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It does not contain any nonexistent options or parameters. The command appears valid and uses correct ffmpeg syntax and options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All specified options are valid and appropriate for the task of extracting frames from a video file.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the provided issue description. The command generated is correct and fulfills the user requirements without errors or invalid options. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
