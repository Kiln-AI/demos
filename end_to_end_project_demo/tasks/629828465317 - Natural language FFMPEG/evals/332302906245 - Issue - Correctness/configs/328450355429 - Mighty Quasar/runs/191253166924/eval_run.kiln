  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to extract video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from their MKV file. I need to figure out how to map those specific streams in ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, I remember that in ffmpeg, you can specify streams with the -map option. The syntax is something like -map 0:v:12 for the 12th video stream in the first input (0), and similarly for the audio stream 25 as -map 0:a:25. But wait, does ffmpeg use 0-based indexing or 1-based for the streams? I think it's 0-based, but the user mentioned stream 12 and 25, which are probably 1-based from tools like mkvinfo. Wait, no, mkvmerge and mkvinfo also use 0-based indexing for tracks, but sometimes people reference tracks by their number as shown in their UI, which might start at 1. Wait, maybe the user is using 0-based, but the question isn't clear. Hmm.\n\nWait, the user wrote \"video stream 12 and audio stream 25\". Let me check mkv's track numbering. In MKV, track numbers start at 0, so the first video might be track 0, then 1, etc. So if the user wants the 12th video stream, it's track 12 if it's 0-based. But maybe in the MKV, the streams are referenced as 12 and 25. Alternatively, the user might be using a tool like mkvpropedit or mkvinfo that shows the tracks in a 0-based or 1-based way. But for ffmpeg, the -map option uses the stream index in the input file. So the streams are listed with ffmpeg's -i option, and ffmpeg can have multiple inputs, but here it's one input.\n\nTo list the streams, the user could run ffmpeg -i recording.mkv. The output will show the streams, each with an index. So if the user wants video stream 12 and audio stream 25, they should map -map 0:v:12 for the 12th video stream (assuming that's the 13th video stream if counting from 0) and -map 0:a:25 for the 25th audio stream. Wait, no. The -map syntax is input_stream_number:type:index. So for the first input (0), the 'v' for video and then the index. So if the video streams are numbered from 0 in the MKV, then the 12th video would be index 12. So in ffmpeg, -map 0:v:12 would get the third video stream if the user counts from 1. Wait, no, if the user's file has multiple video streams, and the 12th is the one they want, then the index is 12. But the user might have a typo here, maybe they should verify their stream indices with ffmpeg.\n\nBut the user says \"my multi-stream file recording.mkv\". So maybe they have a lot of streams. So the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n\nWait, but if they are seeking to copy the streams without re-encoding, using -c copy is the way to go. But they might need to remux them without changing codecs, so -c copy. So the key part is to map the specific streams and remux.\n\nBut a potential issue is that MKV may have other streams (like subtitles, menu, etc.), so mapping only the desired streams will result in an output file with just those two. The user should make sure that the indices are correct. But since the user specified 12 and 25, I'll go with that.\n\nSo the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n\nBut maybe the user wants different output formats. The example in the problem statement uses .mkv, which is okay. If they want another format, maybe change the container, but the question doesn't specify, so I'll assume they want MKV.\n\nWait, if they want to avoid multiple streams, using -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 would copy those streams. Then output to MKV, which should work. So the command is as above.\n\nAnother note: the -c copy is to copy codecs, no re-encoding. If they want to transcode, they need -c:v libx264, but the user didn't mention encoding, so it's safe to assume remuxing.\n\nSo the final command is:\n\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n\nAssuming the streams at those indices exist and are correctly identified. Also, if the user mixed up 0-based and 1-based, perhaps they need to adjust the indices. For example, if the user listed the streams as 12 and 25 (0-based), then that's correct. If the user counted starting from 1, then the indices would be 11 and 24 in ffmpeg. But the answer's explanation should mention that the user needs to check the actual stream indices with ffmpeg -i or mkvinfo. However, since the user specified 12 and 25, proceed with that as given.\n\nSo the explanation would mention that the -map options are used to select specific video and audio streams, and that the user should verify the indices. The command uses -c copy to avoid re-encoding. The output is in MKV format, but other containers are possible as long as the container supports the codecs.\n\nPotential errors: if the streams are audio:12 and video:25, but the user has the video and audio types wrong. But the user said \"video stream 12 and audio stream 25\", so the -map 0:v:12 (for video) and 0:a:25 (audio) is correct.\n\nSo the answer is as above.\n</think>\n\nTo select specific video and audio streams (assuming 0-based indexing as MKV files use 0-indexed stream IDs), use the `-map` option in ffmpeg. This allows precise selection of streams by specifying the input file index (`0` for the first input), stream type (`v` for video, `a` for audio), and stream index (e.g., `12` and `25`). \n\nUsing `-c copy` avoids re-encoding, preserving the original codecs and quality. The output file format (`.mkv` here) is chosen to retain multi-stream compatibility. \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\n**Key assumptions**:\n1. The user has already verified stream indices (e.g., via `ffprobe -i recording.mkv` or `mkvinfo`).\n2. Streams 0:v:12 and 0:a:25 exist in the input file.\n3. The user wants to remux without re-encoding. If the output container (e.g., MP4) does not support the original codecs, re-encoding might be necessary.\n4. Stream indices are 0-based in the MKV file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not contain the issue** described. The command generated correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input MKV file, adhering to the user's request. The provided command, `ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output.mkv`, should work correctly for extracting the desired streams if the specified indices are accurate.\n\n2) The model's output is **not similar** to the example of a failing output. The issued command specified by the model includes valid stream selection using `-map` and does not reference any incorrect options or parameters like the nonexistent preset “extra_fast”. The command structure is appropriate and adheres to ffmpeg's syntax.\n\n3) Reviewing the ffmpeg man page confirms that the command generated by the model does **not break any requirements** dictated in the man page. The command follows the correct format, and options are used in accordance with the descriptions. The indexes are specified correctly with `-map`, and using `-c copy` is a legitimate approach for remuxing without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output should be considered a successful response based on the user's request. Therefore, it should **pass** the evaluation."
