  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "Here's an ffmpeg command that adds subtitles to your video while removing existing subtitle tracks:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -subtitles input.subs -metadata:sqt--force-duplicates 1 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n*   `-vf` stands for \"video filter\" and `scale=-2:720` is used to resize the video as before, ensuring the aspect ratio is maintained.\n*   `-c:v libx264` uses the H.264 video codec as before.\n*   `-preset fast` prioritizes encoding speed over compression efficiency, which can result in larger files but smaller download times.\n*   `-crf 23` sets the quality of the video, with lower numbers being better.\n*   `-c:a aac` uses the AAC audio codec.\n*   `-b:a 128k` sets the bitrate of the audio to 128 kbps.\n*   `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures compatibility with older browsers/devices.\n*   `-movflags +faststart` places metadata at the beginning of the file for fast streaming.\n*   `-subtitles input.subs` adds the specified subtitles to the video. The `input.subs` file should contain the path to your subtitle file.\n*   `-metadata:sqt--force-duplicates 1` removes any existing subtitle tracks by forcing duplicates.\n\nNote: You need to replace `input.avi` and `input.subs` with your actual input file and subtitle file paths, respectively. Also, the subtitle file format should be compatible with ffmpeg; it's typically `.srt`, `.ass`, `.ssa`, or `.vtt`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output has several issues in terms of the command structure and the explanation provided. Let's evaluate it according to the steps outlined.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command does not effectively achieve the stated requirement of adding subtitles while removing existing subtitle tracks. Specifically, it incorrectly uses `-metadata:sqt--force-duplicates 1`, which is not a valid way to remove existing subtitles. Instead, the correct approach would typically involve using `-sn` flag or proper stream mapping to eliminate undesired subtitle tracks.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   While the specific command structure issues differ from the exact \"extra_fast\" issue in the failure example, the command still presents a functional mistake regarding subtitle handling, which goes against the main requirement of the user.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command breaks the expectations set forth in the man page as it attempts to apply options in an incorrect manner. Subtitle management is not correctly addressed. There is no proper flag or command used to remove existing subtitles as requested.\n\n4) **Final evaluation:**\n   Overall, the model's command fails to properly align with the userâ€™s request to add subtitles while simultaneously removing existing ones, breaking the expectations set in the man page for subtitle management. The command should not only work correctly but also fulfill both aspects of the user's request. Thus, the model's output is considered unsatisfactory."
