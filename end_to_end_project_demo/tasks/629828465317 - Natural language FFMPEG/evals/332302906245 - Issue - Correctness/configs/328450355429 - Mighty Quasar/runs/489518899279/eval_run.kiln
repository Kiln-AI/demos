  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams with ffmpeg, use the `-map` option followed by the stream specifier. Video streams are `v` and audio streams are `a`. The index is zero-based, so the third video stream is 2 and the second audio stream is 1.\n\nAssuming you want to copy these streams without re-encoding, use `-c copy` for fast processing and to preserve quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c copy final.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly maps the third video stream (`0:v:2`) and the second audio stream (`0:a:1`) from the input file `multi.avi` to the output file `final.mp4`. It uses the `-c copy` option to copy the streams without re-encoding, which matches the userâ€™s request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated is valid and makes use of existing parameters (`-map` and `-c copy`) that are appropriate for the task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax is correct, and it follows the necessary conventions for input and output stream mapping in `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it generates a correct and functional ffmpeg command that meets the user's request perfectly. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
