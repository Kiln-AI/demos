  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge multiple video files into one, the files must have the same video/audio codecs, resolution, and framerate. The safest and most compatible method for MP4 files is to use the \"concat demuxer,\" which requires creating a text file with a list of the files to join.\n\nAssumptions:\n- All input files use the same codecs, resolution, and framerate, and are not corrupted.\n- You want to perform a lossless merge (no re-encoding).\n\nSteps:\n1. Create a text file (e.g., files.txt) containing:\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n2. Use the concat demuxer:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command directly concatenates the video files without re-encoding, making the process fast and lossless. If the files differ in codecs or encoding settings, you may need to re-encode them first for compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command is appropriate for merging video files provided all inputs have the same codecs, resolution, and framerate. The model clearly states that a text file needs to be created with the input files listed, which is the correct procedure for using the concat demuxer.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command it generates is syntactically correct and follows the rules for using FFmpeg, specifically using the concat demuxer method which is valid for merging files.\n\n3) The command does **not** break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The options are applied correctly with respect to input and output formats, and it follows the required syntax for concatenating video files using the concat demuxer.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output should pass as it does not contain the issues described, does not resemble the failure example, and conforms to the rules set forth in the FFmpeg man page."
