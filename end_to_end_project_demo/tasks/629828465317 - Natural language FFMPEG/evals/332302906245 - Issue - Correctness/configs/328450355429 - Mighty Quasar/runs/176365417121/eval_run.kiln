  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise, you can use the `transpose=1` filter in ffmpeg. For advanced noise reduction, ffmpeg provides the `hqdn3d` filter, which is quite effective. The `hqdn3d` filter parameters control luma and chroma spatial and temporal denoising strength. To apply the strongest filtering, you can choose high values, such as `hqdn3d=10:10:10:10`.\n\n- `transpose=1` rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- `hqdn3d=10:10:10:10` applies aggressive spatial and temporal noise reduction on luma and chroma planes.\n\nYou can adjust the noise reduction values depending on your video's noise level, but these are strong settings which may soften the image.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=10:10:10:10\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssuming `input.mp4` is your source and you want to keep the original audio (`-c:a copy`). You can change the output filename or formats as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it provided correctly rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise and applies the `hqdn3d` filter for advanced noise reduction. The parameters used for the noise reduction filter are valid, and the command follows the correct syntax for ffmpeg.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid and does not contain any incorrect options that might lead to failure.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses the options correctly and adheres to the order required for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues described and it generates a valid command that aligns with the user request and ffmpeg requirements, it should pass the evaluation."
