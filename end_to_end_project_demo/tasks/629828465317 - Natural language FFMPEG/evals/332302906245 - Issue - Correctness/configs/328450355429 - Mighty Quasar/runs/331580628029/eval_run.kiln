  "output": "To set specific bitrates for streaming, you'll use constant bitrate encoding which provides predictable file sizes and bandwidth usage for streaming scenarios.\n\n- `-b:v 10000000` (or `-b:v 10M`) sets the video bitrate to 10 Mbps\n- `-b:a 1000k` sets the audio bitrate to 1000 kbps (1 Mbps)\n- `-c:v libx264` uses H.264 encoding for video compatibility\n- `-c:a aac` uses AAC encoding for audio compatibility\n- `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` help maintain consistent bitrate for streaming\n- `-preset fast` balances encoding speed vs compression efficiency\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures broad compatibility\n\nI'm assuming you want to maintain the original resolution and that your input file is a common video format. I'm also adding buffer control parameters which are recommended for streaming setups.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 10M -maxrate 10M -bufsize 20M -c:a aac -b:a 1000k -preset fast -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated matches the specified requirements of setting the video bitrate to 10,000,000 bits per second (10 Mbps) and the audio bitrate to 1000 kbps (1 Mbps). It also incorporates other relevant parameters for streaming, making it a well-formed command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. The command generated does not contain any obviously incorrect parameters or options such as a non-existent preset. The options used such as `-b:v`, `-b:a`, `-preset`, `-c:v`, and others are valid and appropriate for the context provided.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly specifies options for setting bitrates, video codec, audio codec, and other necessary parameters for the output file. The use of `-maxrate` and `-bufsize` to control the bitrate for streaming is also in line with the supported options outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues as described, it passes the evaluation. The command generated is correct based on the user requirements and adheres to the FFmpeg command structure and options."
