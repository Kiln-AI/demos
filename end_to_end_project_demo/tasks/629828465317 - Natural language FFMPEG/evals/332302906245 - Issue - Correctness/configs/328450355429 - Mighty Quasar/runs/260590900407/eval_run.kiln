  "input": "Combine `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file called `full_movie.mp4`. Make sure there are no re-encoding artifacts.",
  "output": "To combine multiple MP4 files into a single file without re-encoding (avoiding artifacts), use the `concat` demuxer. This method requires all inputs to share the **same codec, resolution, frame rate, and audio parameters**. A text file listing the inputs is used to ensure the container joins them without re-encoding.\n\n- `file_list.txt` contains lines like:  \n  ```\n  file 'part1.mp4'\n  file 'part2.mp4'\n  file 'part3.mp4'\n  ```  \n  (line-by-line list of files to concatenate).  \n- `-f concat -safe 0` tells FFmpeg to read the file list.  \n- `-c copy` copies video/audio streams directly without re-encoding.  \n- Assumes all input files are compatible (same codecs, resolution, etc.).\n\nCreate `file_list.txt`, then run:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy full_movie.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is appropriate for combining multiple MP4 files without re-encoding, addressing the user requirement effectively. It specifies the use of the `concat` demuxer and includes a detailed explanation of prerequisites, ensuring compatibility among the input files.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. It successfully generates a command that is valid and should work correctly as it adheres to FFmpeg's syntax and functionality for concatenating files.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly uses the `-f concat -safe 0` options to read from a list of input files and employs `-c copy` for a direct copy of the streams, fulfilling the requirement to prevent re-encoding.\n\n4) Since the output correctly addresses the user's request and adheres to FFmpeg's operational guidelines without introducing any error, the model has performed appropriately and passed the evaluation."
