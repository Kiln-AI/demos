  "input": "Take my 4K video `drone.mp4` and make it lossless, but the final file size must be under 20MB.",
  "output": "To achieve a lossless rendition of your 4K video (drone.mp4) with a file size under 20MB, we need to understand that \"lossless\" encoding in video means compressing the video in a way that does not degrade the quality (as with, e.g., the Prores codec in FFmpeg). However, Prores or other native lossless codecs usually result in files significantly larger than 20MB for 4K content.\n\nTherefore, the practical approach is to use an extremely efficient lossless compressor like the `ffv1` codec or the `prores_ks` codec, typically adjusted to the strictest quality level (which is slower). However, the file size will still be sizable due to 4K pixel count.\n\nSince the user requires lossless with under 20MB, a better practice is to perform lossless compression (e.g., Prores 4:4:4:4), but check the file size and let the user know to expect a much larger size under normal conditions.\n\nIf you are willing to relax \"lossless\" slightly to something like \"near-lossless\" or selective losses for quality optimization, file size reduction becomes feasible.\n\nAssuming your input is approximately 90-120 MB (typical 4K ProRes file size at 1080p or 4K), you’ll exceed 20MB considerably.\n\n**In conclusion:** The command provided will encode as lossless Prores 4:4:4:4 (which is considered lossless by most), but please expect a large file size (e.g., 120+ MB for 4K footage). If a 20MB file is required, please consider other approaches like selective compression or transcoding.\n\n*Note: If you want near-lossless with a size cap, we’d need to do more advanced bitrate or quality control over the compressed bitrate.*\n\n---\n\nHere is the lossless Prores 4:4:4:4 output command:\n\n- `Prores 4:4:4:4` codec (`prores_ks`) is considered lossless.\n- `-threads 4` uses 4 cores (adjust as needed).\n- Output `output.mov` for Prores compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i drone.mp4 -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -level:v 5.0 -pix_fmt yuv444p10le -c:a copy -thread_queue_size 128 output.mov\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `profile:v 3` and `level:v 5.0`: Optimize Prores 4:44:4 codec.\n- `pix_fmt yuv444p10le`: 4:4:4 chroma format (lossless for Prores).\n- No adjustable bitrate or quality settings involved, as Prores 4:4:4:4 is lossless.\n\n---\n\nIf you insist on a lossless output with a maximum size of 20 MB, consider **re-encoding without compression** and then cropping, or using selective lossy compression (which is another topic). Let me know if you want to explore that!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The user requested a lossless video with a file size limitation of 20MB, which is impractical for a 4K video using a lossless codec like Prores 4:4:4:4. The model's suggestion fails to address the user’s requirement adequately and misleads by stating that a lossless Prores output will suffice, while the model itself acknowledges that typical file sizes for such encodings exceed 20MB. Therefore, it does not generate a feasible solution that meets the user's requirements.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   While the command itself appears syntactically correct, the context in which it is being recommended is flawed due to the unrealistic expectations regarding file size versus video quality. It technically does not fail like the provided failure example (as the command is valid), but it fails in appropriately addressing the user's request effectively.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command itself follows the syntax dictated by the ffmpeg man page, and there are no violations of the requirements. However, while the syntax is correct, the intended output of lossless quality at a size under 20MB is conceptually impractical and does not align with expected outputs for that command given the size constraints discussed.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   Fail. The model's output does contain an issue as it does not generate a feasible command that meets the actual user requirement of a lossless file under 20MB, and it misrepresents the capabilities of lossless encoding for 4K video."
