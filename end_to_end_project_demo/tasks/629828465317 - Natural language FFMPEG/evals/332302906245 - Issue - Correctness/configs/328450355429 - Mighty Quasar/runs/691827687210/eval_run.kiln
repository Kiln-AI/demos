  "output": "To concatenate multiple MP4 files without re-encoding artifacts, you can use the “concat” demuxer if the files have the same codec, codec parameters, and container format. This involves creating a text file listing the input files, then passing that list to ffmpeg with the concat demuxer.\n\n- Create a text file (`file_list.txt`) with each line referencing one input in the format: `file 'part1.mp4'`\n- Use `-f concat` along with `-safe 0` to allow unsafe filename characters.\n- Specify `-c copy` to copy streams directly without re-encoding.\n\nAssuming you already have the files and want a simple command for this process, here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i file_list.txt -c copy full_movie.mp4\n```\n\nEnsure that your `file_list.txt` looks like this:\n\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command provided accurately meets the user's request for concatenating the specified video files without re-encoding artifacts. It appropriately uses the `concat` demuxer and `-c copy` to achieve this. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command is valid and follows the correct syntax and usage of the FFmpeg options. \n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly specifies the `-f concat` option for concatenating multiple files and utilizes `-c copy` to ensure no re-encoding occurs. Additionally, it includes `-safe 0` which is appropriate for allowing unsafe file paths, which is supported by the documentation.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It accurately generates a correct FFmpeg command that meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
