  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams (video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5) from source.mkv and encode them into a new MP4 file, you should use the `-map` option with explicit `-map` statements for the selected streams.\n\n- `-map 0:3` selects the 4th video stream (0 indexed, so 0:3 is stream 3).\n- `-map 0:5` selects the 6th audio stream (0 indexed, so 0:5 is stream 5).\n- The encoder options and container format settings ensure H.264 video and AAC audio for compatibility, setting pixel format to yuv420p.\n\nThis approach avoids copying streams unnecessarily and ensures proper stream mapping.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:  \n- source.mkv has at least 4 video streams and 6 audio streams.\n- You prefer reasonable compression efficiency from the H.264 encoding (adjust preset if needed).\n- You want AAC audio at 128 kbps for compatibility.\n- The output filename edited.mp4 is specified.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is logically consistent with the user's request to map specific streams from a media file, correctly using the `-map` option and providing appropriate codec settings. Therefore, it does not seem to have a mistake that would prevent the command from working properly.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failing example given. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart edited.mp4`) uses valid options and parameters that align with typical usage of `ffmpeg`. In contrast, the failure example presented uses an invalid prescript (`extra_fast`) that does not exist.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All options used are valid and properly formatted. The usage of `-map`, codec options, bitrate specifications, and other parameters adheres to the guidelines provided by the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Final Assessment:**  \nConsidering all of the above evaluations, the model's output successfully meets the requirements of the user, does not contain any issues or errors that would cause it to fail, and adheres to the specifications laid out in the FFmpeg man page. Thus, the command should work correctly as intended."
