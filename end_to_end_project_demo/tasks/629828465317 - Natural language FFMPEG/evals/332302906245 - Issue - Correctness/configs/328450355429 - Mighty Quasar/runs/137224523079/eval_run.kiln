  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific streams from an input file, use the `-map` option in ffmpeg.  The syntax `-map 0:15` selects the 16th stream (numbering starts at 0) from the first input file (numbered 0).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:15 -map 0:22 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nThis command copies the video from stream 15 and the audio from stream 22 of `source.mkv` into `output.mkv`. The `-c copy` option specifies stream copying, which avoids re-encoding and is fast. If you need to re-encode, specify the desired codecs using `-c:v` and `-c:a`.\n</output>",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated accurately selects the specified video and audio streams from the input file, matching the user's requirements. The use of the `-map` option is correct, and the command appears functional without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command it produced is valid and does not include a non-existent option or incorrect syntax. It correctly uses `-map` to select the specified streams.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements as dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The use of `-map 0:15` and `-map 0:22` follows the expected syntax for selecting streams, and the command itself complies with the standard structure of ffmpeg commands, where options are applied correctly.\n\n4) Since there are no issues found in the model's output based on the previous evaluations, it should pass. The command it generated effectively meets the userâ€™s request without any errors."
