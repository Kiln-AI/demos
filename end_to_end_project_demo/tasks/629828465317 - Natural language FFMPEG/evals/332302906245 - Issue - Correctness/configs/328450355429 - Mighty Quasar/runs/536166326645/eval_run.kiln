  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains an issue. The command `ffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 12:25 output.mp4` is incorrect because the mapping syntax used is not correct for selecting video stream 12 and audio stream 25. The correct syntax should specify the mapping as `-map 12 -map 25`, separating the video and audio stream mappings.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the output is not similar to the failure example given. The output produced by the model is not syntactically wrong in that it makes a recognizable attempt to use the mapping option, even though it is incorrect in terms of stream selection.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nYes, the command does not comply with the requirements for using the `-map` option correctly. According to the FFmpeg documentation, multiple streams from the same input can use a colon separator; however, the correct usage in this context should have separate `-map` options for distinct streams (one for video and another for audio).\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output contains an issue and does not correctly fulfill the user's request. It fails to generate a valid and appropriate FFmpeg command according to the specified requirements for mapping streams. Thus, it should be considered a failing output."
