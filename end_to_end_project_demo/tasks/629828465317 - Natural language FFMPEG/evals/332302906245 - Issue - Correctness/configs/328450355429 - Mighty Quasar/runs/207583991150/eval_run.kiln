  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from the input file to the output file, you can use the `-map` option. Assuming you want to map the second video stream and the fourth audio stream, and that you want to keep the rest of the streams as is (or ignore them), you can specify the streams you want to map.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:1` maps the second video stream (`0:v:1`, where `0` is the input file index, `v` is the stream type (video), and `1` is the stream index, where index starts at 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:a:3` maps the fourth audio stream (`0:a:3`) from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` specify that the video and audio codecs, respectively, should be copied from the input file without re-encoding, to save processing time and preserve the original quality.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file `complex.avi` contains at least two video streams and four audio streams.\n- You want to copy the streams without re-encoding.\n- The output container is MKV, which can handle multiple streams and various codecs. You can change the output file extension to another container format if needed (e.g., `.mp4`, `.mov`, etc.), keeping in mind the limitations of the target container format.\n\nPlease adjust the assumptions according to your specific requirements if necessary.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated command effectively maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses the correct syntax for the ffmpeg command.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output example. The output provided by the model is accurate and adheres to the requirements for using the ffmpeg command to map specific streams.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` options to select specific streams from the input file, and the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options are valid and ensure that the streams are copied without re-encoding.\n\n4) Given that the command adheres to the requirements and correctly addresses the userâ€™s request, the evaluation concludes that the model's output is valid and does not contain any issues. Therefore, the model's output should pass."
