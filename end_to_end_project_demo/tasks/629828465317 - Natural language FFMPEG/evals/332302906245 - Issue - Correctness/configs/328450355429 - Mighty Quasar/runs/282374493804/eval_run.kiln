  "input": "Please help me apply temporal and spatial filters together. I want -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' for deinterlacing, scaling and sharpening.",
  "output": "To apply temporal and spatial filters together in FFmpeg, you can chain them using the video filter (`-vf`) option. The filters you mentioned — `yadif` for deinterlacing, `scale` for resizing, and `unsharp` for sharpening — can be combined into a single filter complex in one command.\n\n### Explanation:\n- `yadif=mode=1`: This is the **YADIF** (Yet Another DeInterlacer) filter, set to mode 1 for deinterlacing using spatial and temporal interpolation (`mode=1` ensures deinterlacing with temporal interpolation only for progressive frames).\n- `scale=1920:1080`: Resizes the video to **1920x1080 pixels** (Full HD). If needed, FFmpeg will automatically upscale or downscale depending on the source resolution.\n- `unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0`: Sharpens the luma (brightness) component using a 5x5 kernel. `luma_amount=1.0` determines the strength of sharpening (can be adjusted to your preference).\n\n### Assumptions:\n- Your video is interlaced and you want to convert it to progressive.\n- You want to maintain a 16:9 aspect ratio (`1920x1080`).\n- The filters are to be applied in the given order: deinterlacing first, then scaling, and sharpening last.\n\n### ffmpeg Command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0' output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated is syntactically correct and matches the user's request for applying several video filters (deinterlacing, scaling, and sharpening) in the specified order. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated is relevant, well-structured, and uses existing filters and options correctly, unlike the example of the command with an invalid preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe model's command adheres to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All specified options and filters are valid, and the command is structured correctly. The filters are used in the right order as per the user's requirements.\n\n4) **Final evaluation:**\nSince the command does not contain any errors, follows user specifications, and complies with FFmpeg's requirements, it should pass the evaluation."
