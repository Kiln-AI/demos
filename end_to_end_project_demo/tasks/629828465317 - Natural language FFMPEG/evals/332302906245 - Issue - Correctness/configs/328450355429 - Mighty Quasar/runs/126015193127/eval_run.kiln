  "input": "Convert my 4K video to 1080p and compress it significantly to reduce file size, but keep the best possible quality.",
  "output": "To convert a 4K video to 1080p while compressing significantly but retaining as much quality as possible, use H.264 codec (libx264) with a high quality setting and a faster preset for a good tradeoff between compression and quality. Setting a low CRF (e.g., 18) helps preserve visual quality, but lower CRF values also increase file size. For smaller files, consider slightly increasing CRF or modifying quality/encoding settings.\n\nKey points:\n- -vf scale=-2:-2 resizes video to 1920x1080 while maintaining the original aspect ratio.\n- -c:v libx264 uses efficient H.264 encoding.\n- -crf 18 offers visually high-quality compression with reasonable size.\n- -preset veryslow provides better compression efficiency (slower encoding).\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures broad device compatibility.\n\nAssumption: Original 4K video is in a widely supported format (like MP4, MOV). If uncommon codec is used, change -c:v to match (e.g., -c:v libhevc if source is HEVC-encoded).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input4k.mp4 -vf scale=-2:-2 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryslow -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k output1080p.mp4\n```\n\nFeel free to adjust -crf or -preset for your ideal balance.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues based on the description provided. The generated command is appropriate for the task of converting a 4K video to 1080p while compressing it significantly while maintaining quality. It employs suitable ffmpeg options for scaling, codec selection, and quality settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command uses valid options that exist within the ffmpeg command-line tool. As such, it would not fail due to incorrect option usage.\n\n3) After reviewing the ffmpeg man page, the command produced by the model does not break any requirements outlined therein. All the options used in the command, including `-vf scale`, `-c:v libx264`, `-crf`, `-preset`, and `-pix_fmt`, are valid and follow the necessary structure and form according to the man page specifications.\n\n4) Considering all the evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issues described, and it correctly generates a command that adheres to ffmpeg's requirements. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
