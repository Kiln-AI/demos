  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "<background>\nTo select specific video and audio streams from a container file, you need to know the corresponding stream indices. These can be identified using the ffprobe command or by iterating through the input file's streams.\n\nFor recording.mkv, assuming it contains multiple streams, let's assume the output will be something that extracts the 12th video stream and the 25th audio stream. If the indices are different, adjust them accordingly.\n\nLet's specify the output file name, video and audio destinations, the input file, and verify that the correct data is being written to the output using ffmpeg.\n\n```bash\n# Verify the input file contains the requested streams\nffmpeg -dump 360 -i recording.mkv -ss 00:00:05 -t 00:00:10 -f mpegts\n```\nBy using -dump 360 (we'll multiply it by total number of streams), -ss (seek) 00:00:05, and -t (time) 00:00:10, this will dump video streams starting from the 5th second.\n\nHowever, the `ffmpeg` command for extracting specific streams, `input_file -map_input_stream <stream_index>$ <output>` (e.g., $<number> = stream_number>, will work here:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map_input_stream 12:25 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\nIn simple terms, if `-map_input_stream <video_index>$ <audio_index>$` is used, both video and audio streams specified by the argument. The variable `$<video_index>$ <audio_index>$` can be replaced by the stream index (just 13 and 26, since indexing begins at 0).\n\nHowever, you will not be able to maintain the original file structure (.mkv for encoded streams). If you want both a video and audio container file with the selected streams, consider splitting streams separately before joining them.\n</background>",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains an issue manifesting in the `ffmpeg` command produced. The command incorrectly uses `-map_input_stream` which is not a valid option; it should use `-map` to specify the input video and audio stream indices. Thus, the command will likely fail to execute correctly, as it does not follow the correct syntax required by `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nThe output does not closely match the example given (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`), which fails due to an incorrect preset. The failing output here is related to an invalid command structure rather than a non-existent option. Therefore, while the command is functional, it does not conform to the `ffmpeg` syntax.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command breaks requirements from the man page since it incorrectly uses `-map_input_stream`, which is not an available option in `ffmpeg`. The correct method for selecting streams would be to use `-map` along with the respective indices for the video and audio streams.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output fails due to the invalid usage of `-map_input_stream`. Therefore, it contains the issue described, and the model's command is incorrect. It should have used the `-map` option in the correct syntax to accurately select the specified video and audio streams."
