  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from your source file `complex.avi`, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. This allows you to specify which streams to include in the output. Since `complex.avi` likely contains multiple video and audio tracks, we'll map the second video stream (index 1) and the fourth audio stream (index 3) explicitly.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The source file `complex.avi` has at least two video streams and four audio streams.\n- You want to copy the streams without re-encoding them for efficiency, unless you specify encoding options.\n- You are using a modern version of `ffmpeg` that supports stream mapping.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index starts at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index starts at 0).\n- `output.mp4` is the name of the resulting file. You can change this as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the problem statement. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that accurately maps the second video stream and fourth audio stream from the input file as required by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model includes correct mapping options and uses valid syntax that adheres to the `ffmpeg` requirements, unlike the example with `extra_fast` which is an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. It uses the `-map` option correctly to specify the streams to extract from the input file. The syntax is valid, and it matches the conventions for specifying input streams.\n\n4) Since the output from the model meets all the requirements and performs the specified task correctly, it should pass. The command generated is valid for the operations requested by the user."
