    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output clearly has an issue. It does not contain any valid command or coherent response to the user query. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of generating a correct `ffmpeg` command for the requested task of stacking videos.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to a failing output example in that it does not provide a functional command or even a structured response. Instead, it is nonsensical and lacks any actionable information that responds adequately to the user's request.\n\n3) As the output does not provide any command, it cannot be evaluated against the ffmpeg man pages, which detail proper syntax and usage. It does not include any options, files, or formats, which means it fundamentally breaks the expected requirements.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation of the above criteria, the model's output is entirely derelict and fails to generate a command which works correctly, thus it fails the evaluation."
