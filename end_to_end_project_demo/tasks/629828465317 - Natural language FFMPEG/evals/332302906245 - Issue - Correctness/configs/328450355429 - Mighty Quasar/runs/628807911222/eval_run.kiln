  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To transcode `input.mp4` to AVI using the libvpx-vp9 (VP9) codec with two-pass encoding:\n\n**Assumptions & Notes:**\n1. **Two-pass encoding** ensures better video quality and bitrate consistency by first logging encoding data and then using it to optimize the second pass.\n2. AVI containers historically lack native support for VP9 codecs, so this requires the AVI muxer to accept VP9 (less common). A more modern container like WebM is recommended for VP9.\n3. Audio is **copied** as is (using `copy`), assuming it's compatible with AVI (e.g., PCM, MP3). If not, re-encoding to a compatible format (e.g., MP3) is required in both passes.\n4. A target bitrate (`-b:v 2M`) is assumed for the first and second passes. Adjust as needed.\n\n**Commands:**\n```bash\n# First pass: Generate statistics for two-pass encoding\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 1 -f avi -an -y /dev/null\n\n# Second pass: Finalize video with two-pass data and output AVI file\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 2M -pass 2 -f avi output.avi\n```\n\nIf the input audio is incompatible with AVI (e.g., AAC), replace `-an` in the first pass and `-c:a copy` in the second pass with audio re-encoding flags like `-c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue related to the chosen output format. While it is technically possible to encode VP9 video in an AVI container, it is not widely supported or typical due to compatibility issues. The output suggests using a format that is not ideal for VP9 specifically, which is not aligned with the general recommendation to use a more compatible container like WebM for VP9 video. \n\n2) The output does not resemble the failing output example provided, as it does include valid `ffmpeg` commands, albeit with inappropriate outputs for the chosen codec.\n\n3) Analyzing the commands against the ffmpeg man page, they do not break any specific requirements or valid usage of the syntax. The commands and options used are correctly formatted and adhere to the criteria provided, despite the choice of AVI for VP9, which would not optimally support VP9 encoding.\n\n4) Given that the output does not adhere to conventional usage of codecs with containers, it contains the issue described. The commands technically function but do not fulfill the requirement of generating an appropriate command that works correctly for the given scenario of transcoding to VP9, as AVI is not a recommended format for this codec.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output fails as it does not adequately address the requirement of using a suitable container for VP9, which could lead to performance or compatibility issues."
