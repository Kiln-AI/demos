  "input": "I want to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18 of my input file broadcast.ts and combine them",
  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a file and combine them into a single file, you can use the `-map` option in FFmpeg.\n\n- `-map 0:10` selects video from stream 10.\n- `-map 0:18` selects audio from stream 18.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding (assuming they are in a suitable format). If re-encoding is required, replace `-c copy` with specific codec settings (e.g., `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`).\n\nAssuming the streams are in a format that can be copied directly into the output file, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c copy output.ts\n```\n\nHowever, if your output container requires specific formats (e.g., MP4), and you cannot use raw streams, you may need to specify the output container:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:10 -map 0:18 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain issues based on the provided user requirements. The command generated correctly utilizes the `-map` option to extract video from stream 10 and audio from stream 18, fulfilling the userâ€™s request. The `-c copy` specifies that the streams should be copied without re-encoding, which is an appropriate choice assuming the formats are compatible with the output container. Therefore, it passes this evaluation.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The failure example refers to an invalid preset that does not exist. The command generated by the model is syntactically correct and makes valid use of options available in FFmpeg. It specifies valid stream selections and codec usage. Thus, it passes this evaluation as well.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It follows the correct syntax for input and output, uses options appropriately, and does not include invalid flags. The use of `-map` is properly utilized to select specific streams. It complies with the expected command structure for FFmpeg, passing this evaluation as well.\n\n4) **Final evaluation of the output:**\nOverall, the model's output successfully meets the user's requirements, adheres to the syntax and usage constraints outlined in the FFmpeg documentation, and does not produce any errors in command generation. Therefore, it effectively passes all evaluation criteria."
