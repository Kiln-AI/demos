  "output": "To map the third video stream and second audio stream from `multi.avi` into a single output file `final.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. The `-map 0:n` syntax is used to select the `n`-th stream from the input file, where streams are numbered starting from 0.\n\nIn this case:\n- The third video stream would be `-map 0:2` because video streams are typically counted as the 0th element in the stream order.\n- The second audio stream would be `-map 0:1` because audio streams follow the video streams in the numbering.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:2 -map 0:1 final.mp4\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- `-i multi.avi`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:2`: Maps the third video stream (0-based index, so 2) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:1`: Maps the second audio stream (0-based index, so 1) from the input file.\n- `final.mp4`: The output file where the mapped streams will be combined.\n\nThis command assumes that `multi.avi` contains at least three video streams and two audio streams. If the streams are in a different order or if there are fewer streams, the indices might need adjustment.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?** \n   The model's output does not contain the issue as it generates a correct FFmpeg command that maps the specified video and audio streams appropriately according to the user's request. The mappings of the streams (third video stream as `-map 0:2` and second audio stream as `-map 0:1`) are accurately described.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?** \n   No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The output correctly generates a command that should work without erroneous flags or nonexistent options. \n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?** \n   The command adheres to the requirements as specified in the man page. It correctly uses the `-map` option for stream selection, specifies the input and output files correctly, and does not include any erroneous options. \n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?** \n   The output should pass because it does not contain the issue described, and the command produced aligns well with the user's request and the specifications of the FFmpeg man page."
