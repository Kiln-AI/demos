  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "To select a specific video stream and audio stream from a multi-stream file, we can use the `-map` option. We'll assume that:\n\n* Video stream 12 is the one we want ( based on the `stream` information in the container file).\n* Audio stream 25 is the one we want ( based on the `stream` information in the container file).\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command:\n```\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 output.mp4\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `-map 0:v:12` selects video stream 12 from the first stream set (`0:v`) in the container file.\n* `-map 0:a:25` selects audio stream 25 from the first stream set (`0:a`) in the container file.\n* The input file is `recording.mkv`.\n* The output file is `output.mp4`.\n\nNote: You should check the actual stream indices in your container file (usually in the `stream` information) to ensure the indices are correct. Also, if the streams are not sequential, you might need to adjust the indices accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is syntactically correct and utilizes the `-map` option appropriately to select specific video and audio streams, which matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command produced does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters. The use of `-map` with valid stream indices (provided that they correspond to the user's request) is appropriate.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The `-map` option is correctly used to specify which streams to select from the input file, and there are no known syntactical or logical errors in the command itself.\n\n4) Given that the model's output does not contain the specified issue, produces a valid command similar to the task requirements, and does not conflict with the ffmpeg man page, it can be determined that the model's performance in this instance is **successful**."
