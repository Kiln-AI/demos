  "input": "Please help me encode a video with a bitrate of 2000000k to ensure maximum quality.",
  "output": "To encode a video with a bitrate of 2,000,000 kbps (which is 2,000,000,000 bps), you need to specify the `-b:v` (video bitrate) parameter. This ensures the video is encoded with a high bitrate for maximum quality. The choice of codec and other parameters will affect how efficiently this high bitrate is used, but for maximum quality, using H.264 (libx264) is a good choice as it balances quality and compatibility.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- You're using H.264 as the video codec.\n- You want to maintain the original aspect ratio and resolution unless specified otherwise.\n- You are encoding for general playback compatibility and not necessarily for streaming.\n- The audio bitrate is not specified, so it will use the default or be handled by the container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 2000000k -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-c:v libx264`: Uses H.264 for video encoding.\n- `-b:v 2000000k`: Sets the video bitrate to 2,000,000 kbps.\n- `-preset slow`: Optimizes for quality over speed (slower encoding, better compression).\n- `-crf 18`: Sets the Constant Rate Factor for quality (lower values = higher quality).\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve original audio quality and save time.\n- `-movflags +faststart` (optional): If you're planning to stream the video, add this to move the metadata to the beginning of the file.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is valid and fulfills the user's request for encoding a video with a specific bitrate. The output command correctly specifies the video codec and bitrate, ensuring it will work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced is well-structured and includes options that are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. No incorrect presets or options were used.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are applicable to the ffmpeg command structure, and they conform to the expected syntax and functionality.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble a failing output, and complies with the ffmpeg man page requirements. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
