  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract a specific video and audio stream from a multi-stream file using FFmpeg, you need to map the desired streams using the `-map` option.\n\nIn this case, we're assuming that the input file has at least one video stream (index 0) and at least four audio streams (index 0-3). The FFmpeg command will map the desired streams and copy their contents to the output file, re-multiplexing them into an MP4 container.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy result.mp4\n```\n\n- `-map 0:1` maps the second video stream (since indexing is 0-based).\n- `-map 0:3` maps the fourth audio stream.\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` tells FFmpeg to copy the streams without re-encoding them. They are re-multiplexed into the output container, which can reduce the processing time and preserve original quality.\n\nNote that FFmpeg will automatically decide on the output container format (in this case MP4) based on the output file extension (.mp4). Ensure that your system supports the necessary codecs and container formats.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly extracts the specified second video stream (index 0:1) and fourth audio track (index 0:3) from the input file `input.avi` and saves them into the output file `result.mp4` without re-encoding. The command matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is dissimilar to the failure example. The command generated is valid and utilizes the correct parameters for stream mapping and copying, which would not result in failure as indicated in the provided failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The command uses the `-map` option correctly to specify which streams to extract, and it employs the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is allowed and efficient according to the documentation.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the modelâ€™s output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation as it adheres to the requirements and is functional."
