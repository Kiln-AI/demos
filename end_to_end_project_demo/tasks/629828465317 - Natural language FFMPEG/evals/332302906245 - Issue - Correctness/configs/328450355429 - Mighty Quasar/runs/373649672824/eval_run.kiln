  "input": "I have a multi-track video file and I want to map video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to create output.mp4",
  "output": "To extract and combine specific streams from a multi-track video file, you can use ffmpeg's -map option. This allows you to select exact streams by their indexes. Here, you're asking for video stream 6 and audio stream 9 to be combined into output.mp4.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Stream numbers are zero-based in ffmpeg (-map 0:6 refers to the seventh video stream in the input).\n- Both streams exist and are compatible (e.g., video is decodable and audio is not a subtitle or data track).\n- You want to use default codecs for MP4 (H.264 for video, AAC for audio) unless the streams are already compatible; explicit re-encoding may ensure compatibility.\n\nBest practice is to specify codec parameters to avoid incompatibility, unless you want to use -c copy for remuxing.\n\nHereâ€™s a command that maps the required streams and encodes to browser-compatible MP4 codecs:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\n- -map 0:6 picks the 7th video stream from the first input.\n- -map 0:9 picks the 10th audio stream.\n- -c:v libx264 and -c:a aac ensure browser-compatible encoding.\n- -b:a 128k sets audio bitrate.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes the MP4 for streaming.\n\nIf you want to copy the streams without re-encoding (e.g., if they are already MP4 compatible), replace codec options with -c copy:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -map 0:6 -map 0:9 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nUse the first command for best compatibility; use -c copy if you intend a quick mux without transcoding.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any errors related to the `ffmpeg` command it generates. The command generated uses the correct syntax to map specific streams (video stream 6 and audio stream 9) and includes appropriate codec specifications. The output seems to match the requirements from the user effectively.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output provided in the failure example, which contains an invalid preset option. The command generated does not have any syntax errors or references to nonexistent options. \n\n3) From the provided man page for `ffmpeg`, the command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All the options used (-map, -c:v, -c:a, -b:a, etc.) are valid and correctly applied according to the specifications and examples given.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass the evaluation."
