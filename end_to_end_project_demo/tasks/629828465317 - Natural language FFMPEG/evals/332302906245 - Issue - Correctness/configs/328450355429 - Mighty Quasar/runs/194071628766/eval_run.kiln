  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map the video stream from `0:3` and the audio stream from `0:5` of the `source.mkv` file to create a new file named `edited.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. This option allows specifying which streams to copy into the output file. \n\n- `-map 0:3` tells `ffmpeg` to copy the third video stream from the input file (`0:3`).\n- `-map 0:5` tells `ffmpeg` to copy the fifth audio stream from the input file (`0:5`).\n\nThere are no changes needed for compression or encoding settings for this simple mapping task.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy edited.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` tell `ffmpeg` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is efficient since the audio and video streams are simply being passed through. This is useful when you just want to remux the streams. If you needed to re-encode the streams, you would use `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`, respectively, but for direct pass-through, `copy` is sufficient.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly addresses the user's requirementsâ€”mapping specific video and audio streams without any errors. It effectively uses the `-map` option and employs `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy`, which are appropriate for this action. Therefore, it successfully meets the user's needs.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced by the model (`ffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v copy -c:a copy edited.mp4`) does not contain any nonexistent options or invalid parameters like the example provided. It uses valid parameters that are in line with ffmpeg's requirements.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` options and the `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options are consistent with the description in the man page, which states that you can use `-map` to specify which streams to copy from the input to the output. As such, this command conforms fully with the ffmpeg guidelines.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description and successfully fulfills the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
