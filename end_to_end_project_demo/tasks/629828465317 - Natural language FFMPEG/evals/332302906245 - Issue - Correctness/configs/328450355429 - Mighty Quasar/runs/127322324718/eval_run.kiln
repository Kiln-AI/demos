  "input": "I have a file `input.mov` and I want to convert it to MP4. Please use the `extra_fast` preset because speed is very important.",
  "output": "To convert input.mov to MP4 using the extra_fast preset in ffmpeg, you’ll use the H.264 (libx264) video codec—the standard for MP4 video—with extra_fast encoding to maximize speed. AAC will be used for audio, since it’s broadly compatible. -movflags +faststart enables efficient streaming.\n\nKey parameters:\n- -c:v libx264 chooses H.264 encoding.\n- -preset extra_fast speeds up encoding substantially (lower compression).\n- -crf 23 is a good default balance of speed and output quality. Lower for better quality, higher for smaller files/faster encoding.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 128k encodes audio to AAC at 128kbps.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes the output MP4 for progressive download and streaming.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures maximum playback compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -c:v libx264 -preset extra_fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: input.mov contains compatible video and audio streams. If your input has codecs not supported by MP4 (e.g., ProRes), let me know!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It correctly generates an `ffmpeg` command that matches the user’s requirements—converting a `.mov` file to an `.mp4` file with the specified `extra_fast` preset. The command appears well-formed, with appropriate codec selections and additional options for optimal streaming.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command produced by the model does not include any invalid or non-existing presets. In fact, `extra_fast` is a legitimate preset for `libx264`. Therefore, this output would not fail due to an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The order of options is appropriate, usage of codecs and parameters are correct, and all specified flags are valid.\n\n4) Given the evaluations and analysis above, the model's output does not contain any issues. Therefore, based on the criteria set forth, it passes the evaluation."
