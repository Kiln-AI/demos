  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "To achieve this, we'll use the `afajaspeigle` (aafill_rectangle) filter to add black bars, and then apply the `scale` filter to resize the video to 16:9. Here's the command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -vf \"afajaspeigle=lw10*h/w2,afajaspeigle=10h/lw2,afajaspeigle=lw10*w/2h,w1,afajaspeigle=10w/w1,afajaspeigle=10h/w2,afajaspeigle=lw10*h/w2,afajaspeigle=10h/lw2,afajaspeigle=w1,afajaspeigle=lw10*w/2h,afajaspeigle=w2\" -vf scale=16:9 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n\n* The input video `story.mov` is in a suitable format (e.g., `yuv420p`) that can be used with the `libx264` encoder.\n* The desired aspect ratio is 16:9, and the video should be resized to maintain this aspect ratio.\n* The black bars should be positioned symmetrically on both sides of the original video.\n* The width of the black bars should be 10% of the original width (`lw10`).\n\nNote that the `afajaspeigle` filter is used to add black bars of a specified width. In this case, we're using two bars of different widths (10% of the original width and 20% of the original width) to create the illusion of a widescreen video. The `scale` filter is then used to resize the video to 16:9.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains issues. The command provided does not correctly reflect the requirement to add blurred bars to the left and right of the vertical video to create a 16:9 aspect ratio. It wrongly references an invalid filter (`afajaspeigle`) that does not exist in ffmpeg. Instead, the command should be using the `scale` and `pad` filters or similar valid filters to create the desired output.\n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example since it tries to use an invalid filter syntax and does not achieve the intended result. The command would likely fail to execute due to the use of `afajaspeigle`, which is not a recognized ffmpeg filter.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page because it utilizes a non-existent filter and fails to specify valid parameters or methods to add the black bars to adjust the video to a 16:9 aspect ratio.\n\n4) The model's output fails as it contains an invalid filter usage and does not produce a working ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements."
