  "input": "I want to merge three video files (part1.mp4, part2.mp4, part3.mp4) into one continuous video file.",
  "output": "To merge three MP4 files seamlessly, they must have the same codec, resolution, and encoding parameters. If they do, the fastest method is to use the concat demuxer, which concatenates files without re-encoding.\n\nFirst, create a text file (e.g., inputs.txt) listing the files:\n\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- -f concat specifies the concat demuxer.\n- -safe 0 allows unsafe file paths.\n- -c copy copies streams without re-encoding, making it fast.\n\nIf the input files differ in codec or parameters, re-encoding is necessary. Let me know if that's the case.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated accurately follows the instructions provided by the user to merge three video files using the ffmpeg concat demuxer.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated is syntactically correct and makes use of existing options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-f concat`, `-safe 0`, and `-c copy` are all valid and consistent with the documentation. \n\n4) Overall, since the command is correct and fulfills the user's request without issues, the model's output should pass this evaluation."
