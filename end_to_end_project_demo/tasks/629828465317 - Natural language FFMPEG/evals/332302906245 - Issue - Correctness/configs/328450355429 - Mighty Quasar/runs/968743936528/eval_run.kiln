  "input": "Convert this video to use both libx264 and libx265 codecs simultaneously for maximum compatibility across all devices.",
  "output": "To include both H.264 and H.265 (HEVC) video streams in a single file for maximum compatibility across devices, we must use the Matroska (`.mkv`) container format. MP4 containers cannot support both codecs simultaneously. This approach provides two versions of the same video (H.264 for older devices, H.265 for newer ones) while reusing the original audio (or re-encoding it if needed).\n\n- **First `-c:v libx264`** creates an H.264 video stream (default for legacy playback).\n- **Second `-c:v libx265`** adds an H.265 stream (modern, higher efficiency).\n- **`-vf scale=-2:720`** resizes the video to 720p height while maintaining aspect ratio (assumes encoder compatibility and divisible by 2 width).\n- **CRF values** are set to 23 (H.264) and 28 (H.265) to balance visual quality and file size; H.265 uses higher CRF for similar quality.\n- **`-c:a copy`** reuses the original audio stream (ensure it is compatible; use `-c:a aac` if re-encoding).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:\n1. The original audio is already in a compatible format (e.g., AAC).\n2. The input filename is `input.mp4` (replace with your actual input).\n3. The file size increases significantly due to dual video streams.\n4. Playback software must support dual video streams (e.g., VLC or media players that allow manual track selection).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The `ffmpeg` command generated is incorrect because it attempts to specify two video codec options (`-c:v libx264` and `-c:v libx265`) without proper mapping or syntax for handling multiple video streams in `ffmpeg`. As per the command structure rules, each codec option needs to be linked to the respective output file or input stream, and the command would not function correctly in its current form.\n\n2) The output does not precisely resemble the failure example provided. While the generated command does not conform to `ffmpeg` syntax, it does not use a nonexistent preset, which was the key failure point in the provided example. Instead, it struggles with how to handle multiple codecs simultaneously, which is more an issue of misconfiguration rather than using invalid options.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. According to the documentation, to specify multiple codecs for the same output stream, appropriate mapping should be employed, and options must be defined correctly. In this case, trying to specify two codecs with the same `-c:v` option consecutively does not follow the syntax rules and will lead to an error during execution.\n\n4) Given the analysis above, the model's output contains the issue described, and thus it should be evaluated as a failure."
