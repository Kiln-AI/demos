  "input": "Convert my audio file song.wav to MP3 format with ultra_high quality preset and 320k bitrate",
  "output": "To convert `song.wav` to MP3 with the highest quality and a 320k bitrate, use the `libmp3lame` audio codec and set the `preset` to `extreme` for optimal quality. The bitrate of 320k is the standard maximum for MP3, and the `extreme` preset ensures the encoder prioritizes quality over speed.\n\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` selects the MP3 audio codec.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (maximum quality for MP3).\n- `-preset extreme` maximizes encoding quality at the expense of speed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -preset extreme output.mp3\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly meets the user's requirement of converting a .wav file to .mp3 format with a 320k bitrate using the correct codec and appropriate parameters.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i song.wav -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -preset extreme output.mp3`) includes valid options and does not contain any non-existent or incorrect parameters that would result in a failure.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, the command does not break any requirements. The parameters used are consistent with the documentation. The command clearly specifies the audio codec, bitrate, and format without contradicting any outlined rules or usage.\n\n4) Considering all factors, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is valid and fulfills the user's request effectively. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
