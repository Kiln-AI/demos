  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "The `deshake` filter in FFmpeg attempts to stabilize a shaky video by analyzing motion and applying transformations to counteract it. It works by detecting camera shake and attempting to compensate for it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake output_stabilized.mp4\n```\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated correctly implements the `deshake` filter without any syntax errors or unsupported options, and aligns with the user's request for stabilizing a shaky video.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake output_stabilized.mp4`) is syntactically correct, uses valid options, and does not invoke any nonexistent presets or commands.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The command follows the correct syntax and employs the `-vf` option to apply the video filter, which is appropriate for the `deshake` filter.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issues described, and I would pass the command as it is correct, valid, and meets the user's requirements effectively."
