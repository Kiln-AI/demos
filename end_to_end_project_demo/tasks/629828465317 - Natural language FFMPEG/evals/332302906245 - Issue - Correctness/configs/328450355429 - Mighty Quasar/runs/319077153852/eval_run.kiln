  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To create an MP4 file where the video comes from stream 0:2 (e.g., a secondary video track) and the audio comes from stream 1:3 (e.g., a specific audio track in a different stream index) from your input file, you need to use the `-map` option to explicitly select the streams.\n\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream (stream 0:2) from the input.\n- `-map 1:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (stream 1:3) from the input.\n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the selected streams without re-encoding them. This is the most efficient method if both streams are compatible with MP4.\n- If your streams use encodings not supported by MP4 (e.g., ProRes for video or ALAC for audio), replace `copy` with an appropriate codec like `libx264` for video or `aac` for audio.\n\nAssuming the streams are already compatible with MP4 (H.264 for video, AAC for audio), the following command will do:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 1:a:3 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n``` \n\nIf re-encoding is needed (e.g., not using H.264 or AAC), you can use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:v:2 -map 1:a:3 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command properly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file and uses the `-map` option correctly, which fulfills the user request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is constructed correctly without any errors in syntax or invalid options. The use of `-map`, `-c:v copy`, and `-c:a copy` is appropriate for the stated task.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The use of `-map` options for selecting the video and audio streams is correct, and copying streams without re-encoding is a valid approach. The format of the command follows the expected syntax.\n\n4) Therefore, the model's output does not contain an issue, properly constructs the command, and adheres to the guidelines set forth in the ffmpeg man page. Overall, the evaluation indicates that the model performed well for this task."
