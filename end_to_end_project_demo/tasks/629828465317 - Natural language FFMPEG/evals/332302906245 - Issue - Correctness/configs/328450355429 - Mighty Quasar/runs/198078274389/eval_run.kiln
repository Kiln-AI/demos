  "input": "Convert my video.mkv to MP4 format with 4K resolution and also compress it to very small file size for email attachment",
  "output": "To convert video.mkv to 4K MP4 while aggressively compressing it for email, we'll use H.265/HEVC which offers ~50% better compression than H.264, then further shrink it with slow encoding preset and a very high CRF value (quality vs size trade-off). I assume you want to keep this as small as possible while maintaining reasonable 4K quality for an email attachment (ideal under ~25MB).\n\n- **-vf scale=3840:-2** forces 4K width while maintaining aspect ratio  \n- **-c:v libx265 -x265-params crf=28:vbv-maxrate=500k** uses H.265 with variable bitrate capped at 500kbps to stay small  \n- **-preset veryslow** maximizes compression efficiency at cost of encoding time (can swap to \"faster\" if speeds needed)  \n- **-c:a aac -b:a 64k -ac 1** mono audio at 64kbps (optional to downmix stereo to mono to save slightly more space)  \n- **-max_muxing_queue_size 1024** prevents buffer overflows on low-bitrate encodes  \n\n*Note: 4K videos are inherently large. Even aggressively compressed files will struggle to stay under typical email limits (~20â€“25 MB). For this purpose, you may also need to consider further down-scaling to 1080p or splitting the file.*\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vf scale=3840:-2 -c:v libx265 -preset veryslow -x265-params crf=28:vbv-maxrate=500k -c:a aac -b:a 64k -ac 1 -max_muxing_queue_size 1024 -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Upon reviewing the model's output, the generated command does not contain any syntax errors or invalid options that would prevent it from executing correctly. It follows the required format outlined in the user prompt. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the example of a failing output. The command is logically structured and uses valid ffmpeg options, which contrasts with the provided failure example of an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the ffmpeg man page. Each specified option is used correctly based on its intended function and the command maintains the order as required in ffmpeg usage.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the initial issue description. It generates a valid and functional ffmpeg command that meets the user's request for converting a video to a specific format and resolution while maintaining a focus on file compression for email.\n\n**Verdict: Pass**"
