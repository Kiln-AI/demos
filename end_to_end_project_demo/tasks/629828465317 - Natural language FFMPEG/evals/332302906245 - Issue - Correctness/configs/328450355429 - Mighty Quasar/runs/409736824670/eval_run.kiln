  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles to your video while removing any existing subtitle tracks, you need to:\n\n- Remove all existing subtitle tracks using the `-sn` option.\n- Add a new subtitle track from an external file using the `-c:s` option.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input video file (`input.mp4`) has existing subtitle tracks that you want to remove.\n- You have a subtitle file (`subtitles.srt` or `subtitles.vtt`) that you want to add to the video.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -sn -c:s mov_text -i subtitles.srt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nNote: This command will remove all existing subtitle streams (`-sn`) and add the new subtitle stream from `subtitles.srt` using the `mov_text` codec (suitable for MP4). The `-c copy` option ensures that the video and audio streams are copied without re-encoding, which preserves quality and saves time. Make sure to replace `subtitles.srt` with the actual subtitle file you want to add.",

    "chain_of_thought": "The model's output does indeed have an issue relevant to the user request. Let's evaluate the aspects based on the provided criteria:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   Yes, the model's command does not actually achieve the user's request of **adding subtitles while simultaneously removing existing subtitle tracks**. The command seems to mix up the actions. It includes the `-sn` option which disables subtitle tracks entirely, thus it will not add the new subtitle stream as intended. The model fails to use the correct approach for adding a new subtitle stream to an output file while discarding existing ones.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n   The command does not feature a non-existing parameter and thus does not clearly fit the explicit failing example given. However, it does still produce a command that will not function as intended because it disables subtitles. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n   The command structure itself does not break any explicit rules from the man page; all used options are recognized by FFmpeg. However, the command fails to satisfy the user's requirements effectively due to the misunderstanding of the combination of required operations (removing and adding subtitles).\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n   Yes, ultimately the model's output does contain the issue because while the command structure is valid, it does not meet the userâ€™s requirements of adding new subtitles while removing existing ones. Instead, it disables subtitles altogether, making it inefficient and incorrect for the task specified by the user. Therefore, this evaluation should consider the output as failing in terms of achieving the user's goals."
