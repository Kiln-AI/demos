  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a complex input, use the `-map` option. Here, `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (indexing starts at 0), and `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream. I assume you want to copy the streams without re-encoding to preserve quality and speed up processing.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\nThis command copies the 7th video and 14th audio streams directly into the output file without re-encoding. Adjust output format if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It correctly utilizes the `-map` option to select the specific video and audio streams as requested by the user. The command generated appears to fulfill the user's request to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the input file to the output file without introducing errors in syntax or parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov`) is syntactically correct and uses valid flags and options according to the man page.\n\n3) Consult the FFmpeg man page: The command produced by the model (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov`) does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The `-map` option is used correctly to specify which streams to choose from the input, and `-c copy` is a valid way to copy those streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Given the analysis, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It successfully generates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the required transformations set forth by the user input. Thus, the performance should be considered satisfactory."
