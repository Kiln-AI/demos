  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a file with multiple video and audio streams, you use the `-map` option. The syntax `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (streams are zero-indexed) and `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream. \n\nAssumption:  \n- Your input file `input.mov` has at least 7 video streams and 14 audio streams.\n\nHereâ€™s how you can map those streams and copy the codecs to avoid re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mov\n```\n\n- `-c copy` copies the selected streams without re-encoding (fast, lossless). Remove it if you need to re-encode.\n- Change `output.mov` to any desired output filename and container format.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correctly formatted to map the specified video and audio streams without errors. It uses the `-map` option appropriately as per the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command does not contain any invalid options, and all parameters used are correct and exist in FFmpeg. \n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` option for specifying the 7th video and 14th audio streams, and the syntax is consistent with the expected usage outlined in the documentation.\n\n4) Since the command is valid and matches the user's requirements without errors, it should pass. The model's output is accurate, appropriately formatted, and aligns with the described task. Therefore, it does not contain the issue described."
