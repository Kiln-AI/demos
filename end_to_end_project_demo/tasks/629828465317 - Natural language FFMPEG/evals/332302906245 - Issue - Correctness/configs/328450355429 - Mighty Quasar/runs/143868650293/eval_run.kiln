  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add new subtitles while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you'll need to:\n1. Use `-sn` to discard all existing subtitle streams\n2. Use `-vf subtitles=` to burn in your new subtitle file\n3. Copy all other streams (video/audio) as-is\n\nAssumptions: Your new subtitle file is named `subtitles.srt` and is in the same directory. If you're using a different format or filename, adjust accordingly.\n\nNote that burning in subtitles is a permanent operation - the subtitles become part of the video image and cannot be turned off. The output format will be MP4, which preserves the highest compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -sn -vf subtitles=subtitles.srt -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The ffmpeg command generated by the model correctly addresses the user requirement of adding new subtitles while removing existing tracks. The use of `-sn` to discard all existing subtitle streams and `-vf subtitles=` to burn in the new subtitle file are appropriate for the task. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not include any invalid options or unsupported presets, and it logically follows the requirements given by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options used (`-sn`, `-vf`, `-c:v`, and `-c:a`) are correctly applied and follow the proper syntax for specifying input and output files. The order of options adheres to the required format.\n\n4) Given the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described and thus should be considered a success. The command generated works correctly and meets the user's input specifications. Therefore, I would conclude that the model successfully generated an appropriate ffmpeg command."
