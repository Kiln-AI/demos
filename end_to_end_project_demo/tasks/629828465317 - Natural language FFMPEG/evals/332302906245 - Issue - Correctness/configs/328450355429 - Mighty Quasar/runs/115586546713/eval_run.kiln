  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mp4` and save it as FLAC using the experimental codec (which typically refers to using the newer and more efficient `flac` encoder), and apply noise reduction, you can use the `noise` filter in FFmpeg. This filter can help reduce background noise in the audio.\n\nAssuming you want to use the experimental FLAC encoder and apply basic noise reduction, here's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -noise detection=1 -aq 0 output.flac\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `-i video.mp4`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-vn`: Disables video recording (we only want audio).\n- `-c:a flac`: Selects the FLAC audio codec.\n- `-noise detection=1`: Enables noise reduction (basic level).\n- `-aq 0`: Disables audio quality scaling, ensuring the encoder focuses on the noise reduction and maintains the original audio quality.\n- `output.flac`: The name of the output file.\n\nKeep in mind that the `-noise` filter may not provide advanced noise reduction capabilities compared to dedicated audio processing tools. For more sophisticated options, you may need to use additional parameters or external tools.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains issues. The command `-noise detection=1` is incorrect because there is no `-noise` filter that works like that in FFmpeg, and the option `-aq` is not typically valid for FLAC encoding. These mistakes suggest that the command is unlikely to execute successfully and fails to meet the user's request for noise reduction in a proper manner.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, it is similar in that it produces an invalid command. Just as `-preset extra_fast` is not a valid option, the command includes parameters (`-noise detection=1` and `-aq 0`) which do not correctly correspond to valid flag options in FFmpeg.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, it does. The usage of the `-noise` filter and the `-aq` parameter is incorrect and does not align with the encoding of FLAC audio as sectioned in the FFmpeg documentation. The command also does not specify how the noise reduction should be applied correctly. Therefore, the command does break requirements set in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the output contains issues. Therefore, it should fail."
