  "output": "To extract specific video and audio streams from a transport stream (`broadcast.ts`) and combine them into a new file, use the `-map` option to select streams by their index and copy them as-is (assuming compatible codecs). \n\n- `-map 0:v:10` selects the 10th video stream (index 0 for input 0, stream type `v`).\n- `-map 0:a:18` selects the 18th audio stream (index 0 for input 0, stream type `a`).\n- `-c copy` copies the streams directly (no re-encoding).\n- Output format is inferred as MP4 (`output.mp4`), which is common for combining video/audio.\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- The input `broadcast.ts` is a valid MPEG-TS file.\n- Stream 10 contains video and stream 18 contains audio (validate with `ffprobe` if needed).\n- Codecs of these streams are compatible with MP4 (e.g., H.264 for video, AAC for audio). If not, use transcoders like `libx264` for video and `aac` for audio instead of `-c copy`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.ts -map 0:v:10 -map 0:a:18 -c copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated is logically sound and correctly addresses the user request for extracting specific streams and combining them.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is appropriate, with valid parameters and does not contain any incorrect options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` options to specify which streams to extract, and employs `-c copy` to copy the audio and video streams without re-encoding, which aligns with the ffmpeg command syntax.\n\n4) Thus, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It correctly generates a command that fulfills the user's requirement without errors. It should pass the evaluation."
