  "input": "Please convert my recording.mp4 to a smaller file size using the blazing preset for maximum speed.",
  "output": "To reduce the size of your MP4 file and maximize encoding speed, you should use H.264 with the blazingly fast preset and a higher CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value. The CRF controls video quality, with higher values resulting in smaller file sizes and lower quality. A value of 28 is a good starting point for balancing size and quality—adjust higher or lower if needed.\n\n- -c:v libx264: use H.264 codec (widely compatible and efficient)\n- -preset ultrafast: enables the blazingly fast encoding, sacrificing size/quality for speed\n- -crf 28: lowers quality for smaller files; tweak as necessary (23 is default, higher is smaller/lower quality)\n- -c:a copy: copies audio without re-encoding for speed and identical audio quality\n- output.mp4: name of your compressed file\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 28 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input has AAC audio; if not, specify audio codec: -c:a aac -b:a 128k\n- Quality is acceptable for your use (lower CRF for higher quality if needed)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated follows the correct syntax for `ffmpeg`, and it matches the user’s requirements for reducing the file size while maximizing speed using the \"ultrafast\" preset and an appropriate CRF value.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command it generated is valid according to the `ffmpeg` parameters and does not make a mistake like using a non-existent preset. The `ultrafast` preset is indeed a valid option in `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It adheres to the proper syntax for options and input/output specifications. The options used (-c:v, -preset, -crf, -c:a) are correctly applied, and they meet the expected parameters for encoding, as per the documentation. \n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output passes as it does not contain issues. The generated command is correct, effectively utilizes the options provided by `ffmpeg`, and meets the user's request."
