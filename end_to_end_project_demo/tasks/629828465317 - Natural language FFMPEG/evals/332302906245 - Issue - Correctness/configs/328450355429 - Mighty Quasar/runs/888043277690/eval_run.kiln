  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To achieve this, we'll use the `ffms_filter` method and the advanced noise reduction filters available in `ffmpeg`. \n\nWe'll use `rotate=90` to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise, and apply the strongest noise reduction filters, including the \"weak\" and \"strong\" denoiser filters, and the \"srdenoiser\" (source region denoiser).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf \"rotate=90, scale=-1:-1, fps=23.976, ffms_filter='yadif=w=3:h=3:defaultè¾¹ retard=1, srdenoiser=sr=0.5, srdenoiser_en=0.1, denoiser=smart:denoise.type=p2, denoiser_en=0.01, weak_denoiser=3, strong_denoiser=3, weak_truncate=1, strong_truncate=3, progressive\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\nAssumptions:\n- The input video is 4:3 aspect ratio.\n- The output video should be preserved at its original resolution.\n- The noise reduction filters should be applied to the entire video.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description. The command generated has some mistakes that would likely lead to failure. For example, the `ffms_filter` method does not exist in `ffmpeg`, and there are several parameters that might not be correctly specified or do not exist. This creates a high chance of the command not executing successfully.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example because it includes incorrect or unsupported options, leading to a very high likelihood that the command would fail. The use of `ffms_filter` is a significant factor, as it appears to be a misinterpretation as it does not relate to any valid filter in the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n3) The command does break several requirements dictated in the manual, particularly regarding the filters that are specified. Many filters, options, and their parameters (like `weak_denoiser` and `strong_denoiser`) do not appear to be supported or valid according to the `ffmpeg` man page, highlighting a lack of adherence to the required command structure and available options.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output fails to produce a valid `ffmpeg` command according to user requirements and the `ffmpeg` documentation."
