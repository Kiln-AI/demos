  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize a shaky video using the `deshake` filter, you need to specify the filter in the `-vf` option, setting the necessary parameters for optimal stabilization. The `deshake` filter requires you to specify the width and height of the output video, which can be automatically set using the `iw` and `ih` variables representing the input video's width and height. The filter also allows for specifying the maximum allowed motion in the `rx` and `ry` parameters, which are set to the minimum value of 0 to prioritize stabilization over speed.\n\nBelow is the ffmpeg command to stabilize your shaky video:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf \"deshake=output='width=iw:height=ih:rx=0:ry=0'\" -c:v libx264 -c:a copy stabilized.mp4\n```\nThis command assumes that `bumpy_ride.mp4` is in the current directory. The output will be saved as `stabilized.mp4`. Note: \n\n- `c:v libx264` is used for H.264 video encoding, suitable for most use cases.\n- `c:a copy` copies the audio from the input file to the output without reencoding it. This is usually the best approach unless you have specific reasons to reencode the audio. \n\nIf your video has significant zooming or rotation issues, you might want to look into more advanced stabilization methods or tools, as the `deshake` filter is relatively basic and may not handle these cases optimally.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe command generated by the model seems correct for stabilizing the video using the `deshake` filter with appropriate parameters. However, there is a mistake in the syntax for the `deshake` filter. The output parameter should not be a string that specifies attributes using `'width=iw:height=ih:rx=0:ry=0'`. Instead, it should use direct parameter assignments. This means there is an issue because the specified command will not execute properly due to the incorrect usage of quotes. The correct usage does not require the output option to specify the width and height explicitly as shown, and the parameters for max motion should not be set to zero as this could result in insufficient stabilization.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, the output contains a command that is technically invalid due to the incorrect syntax. While it's not exactly similar to the provided example (which has a non-existent preset), it does exhibit a syntax error that leads to an invalid command. In this case, the issue lies in how the `deshake` parameters are formatted.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command breaks requirements as per the man page regarding the filter syntax. The `-vf` option must specify valid arguments for the `deshake` filter, and the way it is formatted is incorrect. The parameters should be directly assigned without encapsulating them in quotes and constructing them as a single string.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue described. The use of quotes around the `deshake` filter parameters is incorrect, leading to an invalid ffmpeg command that will not function correctly when run. Therefore, this output would fail."
