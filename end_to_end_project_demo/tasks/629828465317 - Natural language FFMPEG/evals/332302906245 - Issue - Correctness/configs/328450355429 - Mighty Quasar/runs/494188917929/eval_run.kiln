  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add new subtitles and remove all existing subtitle tracks in a video using ffmpeg, you need to specify the new subtitles file as an input and map it accordingly while excluding other subtitle streams.\n\nKey points:\n- Add the subtitles file as a second input.\n- Use stream mapping to select only the desired video, audio, and the new subtitle stream.\n- Exclude all other subtitle streams by not mapping them.\n- Use `-c:v copy -c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding video and audio for faster processing and lossless quality.\n- Specify the subtitles input file format and codec; typically, subtitles are remuxed directly without re-encoding.\n- If the subtitles are in soft-subtitle format (like .srt), use `-c:s mov_text` for MP4 or `-c:s ass` for embedded formats as needed.\n\nAssuming:\n- Input video: `input.mkv`\n- New subtitles file: `new_subs.srt`\n- Output container remains MKV, maintaining maximum compatibility.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -i new_subs.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1 -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v` maps all video streams from the original.\n- `-map 0:a` maps all audio streams from the original.\n- `-map 1` maps all subtitle streams from the new subtitle file (usually just one).\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy` copies video and audio without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s mov_text` converts subtitles to MP4-compatible format; for MKV, you can also use `-c:s srt` to keep them as soft subtitles.\n- Outputs `output.mkv` with combined streams having only the new subtitles.\n\nIf you want to embed subtitles as hardcoded (burn in), that requires re-encoding and a different approach.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command accurately reflects the user's request: it adds new subtitles while removing existing subtitle tracks. The explanation provided also correctly describes the key parameters and assumptions made.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command produced is valid and consistent with the requirements; the output command does not feature any invalid options or parameters. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The options used follow the `ffmpeg` syntax correctly, and the command utilizes valid parameters such as `-i` for inputs, `-map` for stream mapping, and `-c:v`, `-c:a`, and `-c:s` for codec specifications.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model's output should pass as it accurately addresses the user's request and generates a valid `ffmpeg` command without errors or invalid parameters."
