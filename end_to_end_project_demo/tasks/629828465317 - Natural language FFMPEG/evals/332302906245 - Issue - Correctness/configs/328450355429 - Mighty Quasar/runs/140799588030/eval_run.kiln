  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "To stabilize the shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`, you can use the `deshake` filter in FFmpeg. This filter attempts to correct for camera shake by estimating and applying an inverse transformation to the video frames. Since the `deshake` filter may not always be perfect, and the input details are not specified, I have assumed that the video is slightly shaky and that applying a simple stabilization should suffice.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake output_stabilized.mp4\n```\n\n- `-vf deshake` applies the deshake video filter to stabilize the video.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake output_stabilized.mp4`) is valid, correctly utilizes the `deshake` filter as requested by the user, and completes the task of stabilizing the video without any errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command it generated is valid, and there are no invalid parameters or options used. The `deshake` filter exists in FFmpeg, and the command's format follows the required syntax.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for FFmpeg, there are no violations of the requirements indicated. The command uses the correct options for input (`-i bumpy_ride.mp4`), applies the video filter (`-vf deshake`), and specifies the output file correctly. All parts of the command align with the provided syntax in the man page.\n\n4) Given that the command generated is valid and meets the requirements, it should pass."
