  "output": "To convert input.mkv to AVI using the libx265 codec with placebo preset for maximum compression, you need to:\n\n- Use `-c:v libx265` to specify H.265/HEVC video encoding.\n- Use `-preset placebo` for optimized compression speed, which balances quality and speed.\n- Set appropriate audio codec and bitrate (default AAC or copy audio if compatible).\n- Use the AVI container format with `-c:a copy` if the audio codec is compatible, or re-encode with `-c:a aac` to ensure broad AVI support.\n- Ensure pixel format compatibility for player versatility.\n\nHere’s the command assuming copying audio codec if compatible, for maximum compression and compatibility:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -c:a copy output.avi\n```\n\nIf your audio codec is not compatible with AVI container inside the output, it should be re-encoded to AAC:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx265 -preset placebo -c:a aac output.avi\n```\n- Use `-c:a copy` to avoid re-encoding audio (assumed compatible).\n- Use `-crf` to control quality if you prefer constant quality coding instead of maximum compression.\n- Use `-pix_fmt yuv444p` or similar for compatibility in some players, but it depends on the final output player.\n\nSince you asked for libx265 with maximum compression (best quality), above commands prioritize that. Adjust the audio coding to `-c:a copy` if the audio is compatible or choose `-c:a aac` otherwise.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue, as the generated ffmpeg command is correctly formulated according to the requirements given in the user input, which was to convert `input.mkv` to AVI format using the libx265 codec with the placebo preset. The model provided the command correctly along with a reasonable explanation.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated does not attempt to use a nonexistent preset, and the parameters specified are valid given the context.\n\n3) The command provided by the model adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options and order in the command are sound, with `-i input.mkv` designating the input file, `-c:v libx265 -preset placebo` defining the codec and compression settings, and `-c:a copy` or `-c:a aac` correctly specifying how to handle the audio stream. The optional audio codec handling for the AVI container reflects an understanding of the potential codec compatibility issues with AVI.\n\n4) Therefore, the model’s output does not contain the issue described. The command works correctly, matches the user's requirements, and adheres to the ffmpeg man page guidelines. Thus, the evaluation passes."
