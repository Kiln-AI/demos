  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to overlay text and apply a blur effect using ffmpeg. Let me recall how video filters work in ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, I know that multiple filters can be chained using the 'filter_complex' option. Each filter is specified in a sequence, and they're separated by commas. So for the text overlay, the 'drawtext' filter is needed. The blur effect would use 'boxblur' or 'unsharp', but 'boxblur' is simpler for a basic blur.\n\nWait, the user mentioned chaining multiple filters. So the text overlay should come first, then apply the blur. But wait, does the blur apply to the entire video or just the text? The user probably wants the blur effect on the video, maybe as a separate filter. Wait, maybe they want to blur part of the video or the whole video. But the original question says \"overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect\". So maybe the text is overlayed, and then the video is blurred? Or the text is overlaid on a blurred video?\n\nWait, the user might want to overlay text on the video and also apply a blur effect to the video. So the order would be: first apply the blur, then overlay the text. But the user's question says to chain the filters. So the correct approach is to use filter_complex with the text overlay and the blur.\n\nBut how to apply both? For example, suppose the user wants to blur the entire video and then overlay text. Then the filters would be 'boxblur' followed by 'drawtext'. Alternatively, if the blur is applied to a specific part, but the question is not specific. Since the user didn't specify, I'll assume they want to apply blur to the entire video and overlay text on top.\n\nSo the filter chain would be: [input] blur [blurred], then overlay text. But how to structure that in filter_complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to overlay text and apply a blur to the video, but the blur could be a separate filter. Let me think. The standard way is to use filter_complex with multiple filters. For example:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]boxblur=3:4:10[blur]; [blur][0:a]drawtext=text='Hello':fontfile=Arial.ttf:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2[video]; [video][0:a]amerge[a]\" -map [video] -map [a] output.mp4\n\nWait, but that's a bit complex. Let's break it down. The first filter is boxblur on the video, then the drawtext is applied to the blurred video. But the user might have the text overlay over the original video, not the blurred one. Wait, the user's question is to overlay text and apply blur. So maybe the blur is applied to the entire video, and the text is overlaid on top. So the order should be: blur first, then drawtext. However, the text overlay is on top of the blurred video. Alternatively, maybe the user wants the text to be on top of the original video, and the blur is applied elsewhere. But without more details, it's safer to assume that the blur is applied to the video, and then text is overlayed on it. But perhaps the user wants to apply blur to the video and overlay text on the original video. But that's ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, the user might want to apply a blur effect to a portion of the video, but that's more complex. Since the user didn't specify, I'll go with the simplest case: apply a blur to the entire video and overlay text on the blurred video. So the filter chain would be to first apply boxblur, then drawtext. But how to structure that.\n\nAnother approach: if the user wants to apply both filters to the same video, then they can chain them in the filter_complex. For example:\n\n[0:v]boxblur=3:4:10,drawtext=text='Hello':...\n\nBut wait, the order matters. If the blur is applied first, then the text is overlayed on top of the blurred video. Alternatively, if the text is overlayed first, then the blur is applied, but that's not likely. So the correct order is boxblur first, then drawtext.\n\nSo the command would be something like:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]boxblur=3:4:10,drawtext=text='Hello':fontfile=Arial.ttf:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2[video]\" -map [video] -map 0:a output.mp4\n\nBut the user might not have specified the font, so I need to note that. Also, the parameters for boxblur: the first number is the blur radius, the second is the sigma, and the third is the number of passes. Default values could be used.\n\nSo in the explanation, I should mention that the blur is applied first, then the text overlay. Also, the user needs to install the necessary filters, like boxblur. Also, if the user needs a more advanced blur, like Gaussian blur, they might need the 'unsharp' filter, but boxblur is a simpler option.\n\nAnother thing: the user might need to specify the input and output. The example assumes input is input.mp4, output is output.mp4. Also, the audio is mapped as is, so the command would include -map [video] -map 0:a. Alternatively, using -c:a copy if the audio is compatible. But if the audio is being re-encoded, then -c:a ... would be needed. However, since the user is only applying video filters, audio is kept as is. So in the command, it's better to map the audio.\n\nSo putting it all together, the command would use filter_complex with both filters, and the user is instructed to replace placeholders like fontfile and text. Also, note that the order of filters in the filter_complex matters. The boxblur is applied first, then the text overlay.\n\nI should also mention that the user can adjust the blur parameters (radius, sigma, passes) and the text parameters (font, size, position). Also, note that the 'drawtext' filter might require the 'fontfile' parameter, which the user must provide, or use system fonts if available. So in the explanation, the user needs to have the font file available or specify a system font. Alternatively, if the system font is used, they can omit the 'fontfile' parameter, but that depends on the system.\n</think>\n\nTo overlay text on a video and apply a blur effect, use `filter_complex` with chained video filters. The order of filters mattersâ€”apply the blur first, then overlay the text. The `boxblur` filter applies a Gaussian blur, and `drawtext` adds text. Ensure the audio is preserved using `-map 0:a`.\n\n- `boxblur=3:4:10`: Applies a blur with radius 3, sigma 4, and 10 passes. Adjust parameters for different blur intensity.\n- `drawtext=text='Your Text':...`: Adds text to the video. Replace placeholders like `fontfile` with actual font paths or omit for system fonts.\n- `-map [video] -map 0:a`: Maps the processed video and original audio to the output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]boxblur=3:4:10,drawtext=text='Hello World':fontfile=/path/to/font.ttf:fontsize=24:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2[video]\" -map [video] -map 0:a output.mp4\n``` \n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- You have a font file (`/path/to/font.ttf`) or use a system font (remove `fontfile=...` if needed).  \n- The input audio is compatible with the output format; if not, re-encode it with `-c:a aac` or similar.  \n- The blur is applied to the full video, and text is centered. Adjust `x`/`y` for custom positioning.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not exhibit any issues with the ffmpeg command generated by the model. The command appears to correctly apply the video filters and is logically structured to achieve the user's request for applying blur and overlaying text. Therefore, it passes this step.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The example given shows a command that contains an invalid preset option. In contrast, the model's output generates a valid ffmpeg command without invalid options. Thus, it passes this step as well.\n\n3) **Here does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nAfter reviewing the command, it adheres to the requirements set forth in the ffmpeg man page. Each option is correctly applied according to the specifications in the man page, and there are no incompatibilities or syntax errors. The audio mapping and video filter chaining with `filter_complex` are used correctly, and the video filters are chained in the correct order. Thus, it also passes this step.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It meets the requirements, generates a correct and executable command, and does not fail in any regard. Therefore, the overall evaluation is that the output is correct and passes all checks."
