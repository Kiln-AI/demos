  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": "To extract frames from video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with maximum resolution, you can use ffmpeg's frame rate option (-r) for interval extraction and set the image format and naming convention. PNG is a lossless format ideal for ultra-high resolution images. Specifying -q:v 1 is more relevant for lossy formats like JPEG; PNG does not use quality scale, so it can be omitted. Additionally, you donâ€™t need to scale or alter resolution to maintain the original if you want to extract the video as-is.\n\nIf you want to ensure the full original resolution is retained, do not specify scaling.\n\nAssuming you want images named in a sequence like frame001.png, frame002.png, and so on.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -vf fps=1/2 frame%03d.png\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- -i video.avi specifies the input file.\n- -vf fps=1/2 extracts one frame every 0.5 seconds (since 1/2 == 0.5, representing 0.5 fps -> 2 seconds interval).\n- frame%03d.png outputs sequential numbered PNG files (frame001.png, frame002.png, etc.).\n- No scaling or quality adjustments since full resolution is desired.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is suitable for extracting frames from the specified video at the desired interval and storing them in PNG format. The logic applied in the command aligns with the requirements outlined in the user message.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The generated command is valid and appropriately uses ffmpeg's options. It does not use any non-existent options or incorrect syntax.\n\n3) The command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax used is correct, and the options specified (-i for the input file, -vf for the video filter to set the frames per second, and the output file format) are valid according to the man page. The command is likely to work as intended without violating any specified rules.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. Therefore, this evaluation should pass."
