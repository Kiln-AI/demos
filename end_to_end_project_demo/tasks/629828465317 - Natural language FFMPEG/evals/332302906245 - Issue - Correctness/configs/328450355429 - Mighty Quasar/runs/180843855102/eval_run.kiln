  "input": "My video `concert.mp4` has 5.1 surround sound. Can you convert it to stereo audio, but mix the rear channels at 50% volume?",
  "output": "To downmix 5.1 surround sound to stereo while reducing the volume of the rear (surround) channels to 50%, you can use the `-af` (audio filter) with `pan` to control the audio channels precisely.\n\nIn 5.1 audio, channels are usually ordered as:\n- 0: Front Left (FL)\n- 1: Front Right (FR)\n- 2: Center (C)\n- 3: LFE (Low Frequency Effects)\n- 4: Rear Left (SL)\n- 5: Rear Right (SR)\n\nWe want to mix to stereo (left and right) as follows:\n- Left output: FL + 0.5 * SL + some Center contribution (often centered)\n- Right output: FR + 0.5 * SR + some Center contribution\n- LFE often is ignored or mixed quietly to avoid overpowering bass\n\nA practical pan filter command for stereo output is:\n\n`pan=stereo|c0=FL + 0.5*SL + 0.707*C|c1=FR + 0.5*SR + 0.707*C`\n\nwhere 0.707 (~1/sqrt(2)) is a common value to balance mono center channel into stereo.\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert.mp4 -c:v copy -af \"pan=stereo|c0=0 + 0.5*4 + 0.707*2|c1=1 + 0.5*5 + 0.707*2\" -c:a aac -b:a 192k output_concert_stereo.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v copy` keeps video unchanged.\n- `-af \"pan=...\"` mixes audio channels as requested.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` encodes stereo AAC audio at 192 kbps.\n- Channel indices (0 to 5) correspond to FL, FR, C, LFE, SL, SR respectively.\n\nThis assumes your input channel layout is standard 5.1. If not, you may want to verify channel mapping with `ffprobe`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The generated ffmpeg command accurately reflects the user's request to downmix 5.1 surround sound to stereo while reducing the volume of the rear channels to 50%. The correct audio filtering is applied using the `pan` filter. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command produced by the model utilizes valid syntax and parameters without any apparent non-existent options or incorrect usages.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All the options used (`-i`, `-c:v copy`, `-af`, `-c:a aac`, and `-b:a 192k`) are valid and properly placed according to the syntax rules mentioned. \n\nIn conclusion, the model's output passes all evaluation steps and effectively meets the userâ€™s requirements."
