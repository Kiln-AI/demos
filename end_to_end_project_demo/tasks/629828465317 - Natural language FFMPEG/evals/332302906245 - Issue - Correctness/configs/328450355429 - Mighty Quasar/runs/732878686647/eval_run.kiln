  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as high-quality MP3, you'll use the libmp3lame encoder with the highest quality settings. For maximum quality MP3, use a bitrate of 320 kbps which is the highest standard bitrate for MP3.\n\n- `-vn` disables video processing since we only want audio\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` uses the LAME MP3 encoder for high quality\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps (maximum standard MP3 bitrate)\n- `-q:a 0` sets the quality to highest (0 is best quality for VBR, but we're using CBR here)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k -q:a 0 audio.mp3\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated by the model properly extracts the audio from the video file `video.mkv` and saves it as a high-quality MP3 file `audio.mp3` using the correct bitrate. All parameters match the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated does not contain any invalid options or incorrect syntax, and therefore should not fail.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All parameters used in the command are valid according to the syntax and options specified for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command works correctly and matches the user's requirements. Hence, it passes the evaluation."
