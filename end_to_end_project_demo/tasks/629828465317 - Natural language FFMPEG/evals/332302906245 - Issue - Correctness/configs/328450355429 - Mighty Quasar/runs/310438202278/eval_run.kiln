  "output": "To map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from `input.mov` to create a single output file, you can use the `-map` option in `ffmpeg`. The `-map` option allows you to specify which streams you want to include in the output file. \n\nAssume the input file `input.mov` has multiple video and audio streams, and you want to select the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:6 -map 0:13 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mov`: Specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:6`: Maps the 7th video stream (0-based index, so 6) from the input file to the output.\n- `-map 0:13`: Maps the 14th audio stream (0-based index, so 13) from the input file to the output.\n- `-c copy`: Copies the streams without re-encoding. This is efficient but may not be suitable if the streams need to be transcoded.\n- `output.mp4`: Specifies the name of the output file.\n\nIf re-encoding is necessary, you can omit the `-c copy` flag and specify the desired codecs and settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated appears to correctly align with the user's request to map the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model is syntactically and functionally appropriate for the task at hand, unlike the failing example command which included an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements from the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map` options and `-c copy` is correctly implemented according to the specifications provided in the man page.\n\n4) As the command does not contain issues, does not resemble the failing example, and adheres to the man page requirements, it passes the evaluation."
