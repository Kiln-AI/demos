  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from a video file and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, I'll use FFmpeg to decode the video stream and encode the audio stream into FLAC. The `maximum_compression` preset will prioritize achieving the smallest possible file size, potentially at the cost of encoding time.\n\n- `copy:a` streams the audio without re-encoding, if the audio is already in a suitable format. If not, it will be decoded and re-encoded.\n- `flac` specifies the FLAC audio encoder.\n- `maximum_compression` sets the encoding priority to maximum compression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map 0:a -c:a flac -preset maximum_compression audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. The command uses the `-preset` option, which is not applicable to the FLAC audio codec in FFmpeg. The FLAC codec does not support various preset values like video codecs do; it only supports different encoding options defined within its own framework. Therefore, using `-preset maximum_compression` results in an incorrect command.\n\n2) The output is similar to the failure example since it improperly uses the `-preset maximum_compression`, which is not a valid option for FLAC encoding. Just like the example provided where `extra_fast` is not a valid preset, `maximum_compression` is also invalid for this context.\n\n3) The command breaks requirements dictated in the man page. The man page indicates that certain codecs do not utilize the same preset system that is available for video codecs. Therefore, this command is not valid given the specified task, which suggests the model did not follow the rules.\n\n4) Considering the above reasons, the model's output does contain the issue described, and thus it fails the evaluation."
