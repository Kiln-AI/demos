  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mkv and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with maximum bitrate.",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mkv` and save it as a high-quality MP3 file with the maximum bitrate, you would typically use a bitrate that supports the full range of audio quality. However, the maximum bitrate for MP3 is 320 kbps for stereo audio. Here's the ffmpeg command to extract the audio with the highest possible quality:\n\n- `-i video.mkv` specifies the input file.\n- `-vn` removes the video from the output.\n- `-acodec mp3` specifies the output audio codec as MP3.\n- `-b:a 320k` sets the audio bitrate to the maximum of 320 kbps.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mkv -vn -acodec mp3 -b:a 320k output.mp3\n```\n\nThis command will extract the audio and save it as `output.mp3` with the best possible quality for MP3 format.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated by the model correctly extracts audio from the video file and saves it as an MP3 file with the maximum bitrate, which aligns with the user's request.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is properly structured and does not include any invalid options or erroneous syntax. It follows the syntax rules, and all options specified are valid within the FFmpeg command.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   No, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All specified options such as `-i`, `-vn`, `-acodec`, and `-b:a` are valid and correctly applied to the input and output files. The ordering of options is appropriate, and the options used conform to the expected behavior for extracting audio from a video file.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
