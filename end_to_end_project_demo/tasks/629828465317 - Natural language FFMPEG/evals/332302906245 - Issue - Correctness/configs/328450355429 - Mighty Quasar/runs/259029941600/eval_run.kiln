  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To select specific streams from the input file, you can use the `-map` option. Stream indexing starts from 0, so the second video stream is `0:v:1` and the fourth audio stream is `0:a:3` (assuming one input, hence stream specifiers start with 0).\n\nThis command copies the selected streams without re-encoding (`-c copy`) for faster processing and no quality loss.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nNote: The output container is set to MKV for better stream compatibility with arbitrary streams; you can change the extension if needed.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the prompt. The output command appears to correctly implement the task of mapping the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the input file, adhering to the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the provided example of a failing output. The output command is logical and uses valid stream mappings and options based on the criteria given by the user.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The mapping of streams, the use of `-c copy` for stream copying, and the output file format chosen (MKV) are all valid and compatible with `ffmpeg`'s documentation.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described, resulting in a **pass** for the command generated. The command is appropriate for selecting the specified streams as intended by the user."
