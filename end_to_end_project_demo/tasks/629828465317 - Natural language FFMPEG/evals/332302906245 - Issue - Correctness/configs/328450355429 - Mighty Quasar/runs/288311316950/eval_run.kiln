  "input": "Convert my video to work on all devices with universal codec support and maximum compatibility settings.",
  "output": "For maximum compatibility across devices, the H.264 video codec and AAC audio codec are generally recommended. The command below sets the pixel format to yuv420p, which is widely supported, and uses a relatively low complexity H.264 profile (baseline) and level (3.0) to ensure compatibility with older devices. It also includes the `faststart` flag for optimized streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -profile:v baseline -level 3.0 -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command produced by the model is syntactically correct and provides a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user's requirement for maximum compatibility settings. It correctly specifies the necessary codecs and parameters for broad device compatibility.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command is structured properly and does not contain an invalid option or a non-existent preset. Therefore, it does not exhibit the same failing characteristics.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options used are valid according to the ffmpeg documentation. The options for codec, pixels format, audio bitrate, and faststart flag are correctly applied. \n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command is correct, adheres to the syntax and usage as outlined in the man page, and successfully addresses the requirements posed by the user. Overall, the model performed well in generating an appropriate ffmpeg command in response to the user's request."
