  "input": "I need to remove all audio from `video_only.mp4` without re-compressing the video stream.",
  "output": "To remove all audio from a video without re-encoding the video stream, you should copy the existing video codec directly, discarding the audio stream.\n\n- -map 0 removes all streams by default, so specifying -map 0:v copies just the video stream.\n- -c:a none instructs ffmpeg to exclude audio.\n  \nThis results in a completely silent video file with the original video stream directly copied from the input file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -map 0:v -c:a none output_video_only.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: The input file has only one video stream. If there are subtitles or multiple video streams, additional analysis or parameters may be required. This method is the most efficient approach (no re-encoding), preserving original quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated (`ffmpeg -i video_only.mp4 -map 0:v -c:a none output_video_only.mp4`) is a valid command and correctly matches the user's request to remove the audio without re-compressing the video stream.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it produced is correctly formatted and does not include any invalid options like the preset `extra_fast`, which does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The usage of `-map 0:v` to select only the video stream and `-c:a none` to specify that no audio codec should be used is appropriate for the task of removing audio from a video file without re-encoding the video stream.\n\n4) Based on the above evaluations, the model’s output successfully fulfills the user’s request without containing any errors or issues. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
