  "output": "To map specific streams from a source file, use the `-map` option. The streams are indexed starting from 0, so to map the second video stream (index 1) and the fourth audio stream (index 3), use the following command:\n\nWhen mapping specific streams, ensure the input streams actually exist. Use `-stream` information from the source file (command  `ffmpeg -i complex.avi`) to find the stream numbers if they're not known.\n\nAssuming standard stream mapping is not sufficient for your needs (main video & audio streams are mapped unless specified otherwise), you'll need streams' mapping for your desired output. Note that non mapped streams will not be in output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -map 0:0? -map 0:2? -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -y output.mp4\n```\nExplanation: we check existence of video and audio streams if existed (-map 0:0? -map 0:2?), beside targeting the isolated mentioned ones to (index = \"[input_number]:stream type :stream position\")\n\nAlternatively you can fail out invalid mapping index e.g usage `-map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3`\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -y output.mp4\n```\nRemember these would not return exception messages unlike -map error exit style",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Evaluation of the Command's Correctness**:\n   - The output correctly addresses the user's need to specify which video and audio streams to map from the input file. The mapping provided (`-map 0:1` for the second video stream and `-map 0:3` for the fourth audio stream) is accurate based on the standard zero-based indexing used by ffmpeg. \n   - However, the command generated may not work as expected due to the use of optional mappings for the first video and audio streams (`-map 0:0? -map 0:2?`). While these options include safe checks for their existence, it generally may lead to confusion, as the user did not request them, and it is unnecessary if the user only wants the specified streams.\n\n2) **Comparison with Example of Failing Output**:\n   - The command does not resemble the failing output example given. The failing output provided a command that is clearly incorrect due to a nonexistent preset (`-preset extra_fast`), whereas the command produced by the model uses valid mapping commands (`-map 0:1` and `-map 0:3`). Thus, there is no similarity to the failure example.\n\n3) **Consulting the FFmpeg Man Page**:\n   - The command follows the structure dictated in the FFmpeg man page, as it correctly specifies input options and an output file. Regarding required map options, the provided mappings are valid, and the inclusion of codecs (`-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`) is compatible with stream mapping as per the documentation.\n   - However, the `-map` commands without sufficient checking for the existence of streams in the source could lead to an error if the specified streams do not exist in `complex.avi`. The command's additional mappings for existing streams (`-map 0:0? -map 0:2?`) could inherently conflict with the user display if these indices do not precisely match what exists in the source file.\n\n4) **Final Assessment**: \n   - The model's output addresses the user input effectively, fulfilling the core requirement of mapping specified streams. The mapping indexes are appropriate. However, the addition of optional mappings may confuse users and lead to potential mishaps if the conditions are not met. The command produced is generally correct, and does not break any standard requirements from FFmpeg. Therefore, I assess that the output has some areas for improvement but accurately completes the user's request.\n\n**Conclusion**: The model's output does mainly meet the user request correctly, but should ideally be clearer about unnecessary additional mapping based on optional conditional checks which may complicate the use case. It does not contain failures nor break the requirements as outlined in the man page, so it passes the evaluation overall."
