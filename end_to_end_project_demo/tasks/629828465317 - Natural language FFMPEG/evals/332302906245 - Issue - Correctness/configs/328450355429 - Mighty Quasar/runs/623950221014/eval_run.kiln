  "input": "Can you help me chain filters to rotate video and add fade effects? I need -vf 'transpose=1,fade=in:0:30;fade=out:270:30' to rotate 90 degrees clockwise and add fade in/out.",
  "output": "To chain rotate and fade filters, you need to apply them inline with a comma (`,`).  \nThe semicolon (`;`) in the user message breaks the filter chain; all filters must be on one filter list (commas only).  \nWith that simple fix the command becomes:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf 'transpose=1,fade=in:0:30,fade=out:270:30' -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output addressed the issue described in the issue description. It correctly identified that the semicolon (`;`) in the user message was breaking the filter chain, and it provided a command with commas (`,`) to properly chain the filters for rotation and fade effects. Thus, the output does not contain the issue and correctly represents the requirements of chaining filters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command produced is likely to work correctly, as it uses valid filter options and maintains proper syntax for chaining filters. The provided output does not include any presets that don't exist or any other incorrect syntax.\n\n3) The command generated by the model complies with requirements set forth in the ffmpeg man page. The use of the `-vf` option correctly chains the filters `transpose` (for rotation) and `fade` effects, adhering to the proper format for ffmpeg commands.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issues of incorrect command usage described, passes the similarity test against the failure example, and aligns with the ffmpeg man page requirements, it can be concluded that the model performed well in this instance. The output is a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's request without introducing errors. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
