  "output": "To map the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from `complex.avi` and include them as separate streams in the output, you can use the `-map` option to select the specific streams and then specify how to handle their output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` maps the second video stream (index 1).\n- `-map 0:a:3` maps the fourth audio stream (index 3; since the first audio stream is at index 0, the fourth would be at index 3).\n\nTo keep the streams separate, you can instruct ffmpeg to copy the codecs without re-encoding by using `-c copy`. However, if remuxing to a container that doesn't support all streams (like MKV), some streams might be dropped. If a standard container supports all streams, you should use `-map` without re-encoding to keep existing streams intact.\n\nFor example, if you want the output in MKV with two video and four audio streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy -f mkv output.mkv\n```\n\nThis will copy the streams without re-encoding; use `-c copy` for faster processing, preserving quality and dropping no streams, but may lose compatibility.\n\nIf you want to explicitly show handling stream copy and muxing to output format with all streams supported:\n\nYou can also output directly without specifying codecs to let ffmpeg respect stream selection and muxer capabilities automatically:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -f mkv -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf you want to re-encode or re-arrange streams, you would specify codecs (e.g., re-encode video with `-c:v libx264`, audio encodings manually).\n\nPlease ensure the output container (`mkv` here) supports at least four audio streams, or remuxing can drop some.\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\n- Map the second video stream (`0:v:1`).\n- Map the fourth audio stream (`0:a:3`).\n\nEither approach keeps the streams intact without quality loss, assuming the container supports at least four audio streams.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Output container is MKV.\n- There are at least two video and four audio streams in `complex.avi`.\n- Streams can be mux without re-encoding.\n- If compatibility and muxing are problematic, re-encoding may be required, but copy without codec re-encoding is fastest and preserves quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \n**Pass:** The command generated by the model seems to fulfill the requirements of mapping the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the input file `complex.avi`. It uses the correct mapping indexes and appropriate options for copying the streams without re-encoding. Therefore, it does not contain any issues that would cause it to fail.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \n**Pass:** The output does not resemble the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is valid and does not include any incorrect or non-existent parameters. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \n**Pass:** The command adheres to the requirements specified in the FFmpeg man page. It uses valid options (`-map`, `-c copy`, and format specification for MKV) and does not contradict any rules outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \n**Pass:** The output does not contain any issues as it generates a correct command that meets the user's requirements without breaking any rules dictated by the FFmpeg man page. Overall, the model's performance on this task is satisfactory."
