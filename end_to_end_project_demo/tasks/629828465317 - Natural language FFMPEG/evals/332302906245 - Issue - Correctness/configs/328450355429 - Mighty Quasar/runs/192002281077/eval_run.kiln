  "input": "I need to apply a brightness filter and then a contrast filter to my video. Can you chain these filters together with a scale filter to resize to 1080p?",
  "output": "To apply brightness and contrast adjustments along with resizing the video to 1080p, you can use the `eq` filter for brightness and contrast, then chain it with the `scale` filter. The `eq` filter parameters are `brightness` (range: -1 to 1) and `contrast` (default 1). Resizing to 1080p means scaling to 1920x1080.\n\nAssuming you want to increase brightness slightly (e.g., 0.1) and contrast slightly (e.g., 1.2)—you can adjust these values as needed.\n\nHere's the ffmpeg command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,scale=1920:1080\" output.mp4\n```\n\nThis reads `input.mp4`, applies brightness and contrast changes, scales the video to 1920x1080, then saves to `output.mp4`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is formatted correctly and technically valid based on the requirements given by the user for applying brightness and contrast filters while resizing the video to 1080p.\n\n2) The model’s output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated does not contain any incorrect or non-existent parameters, such as an invalid preset. Instead, it constructs a valid pipeline using known filters and their parameters.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The generated command syntax correctly follows the format for using the `-vf` option to specify video filters along with input and output filenames. The filters `eq` for brightness and contrast, and `scale` for resizing are valid filters recognized by FFmpeg.\n\n4) Given the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described, so it should pass. The output correctly meets the user requirements for applying filters and resizing."
