  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset, you can use the ffmpeg command with the `-vn` option to remove any unnecessary video streams, use the `- codecs` option to explicitly specify FLAC as the audio codec, and the `-preset` option to set the maximum compression preset.\n\n- `-vn` disables video processing, which is a good practice to ensure only audio is extracted.\n- `-codec:a flac` specifies FLAC as the audio codec.\n- `-loglevel error` suppresses less useful log output, focusing on errors.\n- `-preset maximum` uses the maximum compression preset for FLAC, which balances smaller file size and encoding speed.\n\nAssuming you want to save the FLAC as a standalone file named `output.flac`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -codec:a flac -loglevel error -preset maximum output.flac\n```\n\nThis command extracts the audio, compresses it to the best FLAC file size using the maximum preset, and produces a FLAC audio file named `output.flac`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command mentions the usage of a `-preset` option with `maximum`, but the `-preset` option is not valid for the FLAC codec in FFmpeg. Instead, to maximize compression with FLAC, one typically uses the `-compression_level` parameter, which takes a value from 0 to 12, where 12 provides the highest compression. Thus, the command will not work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failing output example provided. The issue in this case is specific to the incorrect use of the `-preset` option, rather than a completely non-existent preset like `extra_fast`. \n\n3) The command does break a requirement dictated in the man page. As mentioned, there is no `-preset` option for the FLAC codec, which makes the command incorrect. The documentation clearly states that codec-specific options must be chosen according to what is available for that codec.\n\nIn summary, the model has failed to generate a correct command because it misapplied the `-preset` option, which is invalid for FLAC. The correct approach is to use `-compression_level` instead. Therefore, the result should be marked as a failure due to this oversight."
