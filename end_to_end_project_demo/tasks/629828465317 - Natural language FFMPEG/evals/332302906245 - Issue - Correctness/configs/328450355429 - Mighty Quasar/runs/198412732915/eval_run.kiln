  "input": "I need to select video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from my input file broadcast.mkv and save them as trimmed.mp4",
  "output": "To extract specific video stream 0:4 and audio stream 0:9 from your input file broadcast.mkv and save them into an MP4 container, you need to use stream selection options. The `-map` option allows you to select particular streams explicitly. Additionally, to ensure the audio and video are properly muxed in the output MP4, you should specify MP4-compatible codecs (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC or MP3 for audio). Also, since you are selecting streams directly, you may want to pass `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding (fast and lossless), but keep in mind MP4 container compatibility requirements for codecs and stream types.\n\nIf streams 0:4 and 0:9 are already encoded in codecs compatible with MP4 (e.g., H.264 for video and AAC for audio), then copying is recommended. If not, you should specify encoding.\n\nHere's the general command assuming codecs are compatible and you want to copy streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:4` selects stream 4 from input 0 (i.e., first input file).\n- `-map 0:9` selects stream 9 from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies the selected streams without re-encoding for faster processing and no quality loss.\n- `-movflags +faststart` moves MOOV atom to the beginning of the file for better browser compatibility.\n- Output is written to `trimmed.mp4`.\n\nIf you need to re-encode because codecs are incompatible with MP4, replace `-c copy` with encoding options, for example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nThis encodes video with H.264 and audio with AAC at 128kbps.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of best practice command assuming MP4-compatible codecs:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command provided effectively fulfills the user's requirement to select specific video and audio streams from the input file and save them to an output file without any errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command it generated, `ffmpeg -i broadcast.mkv -map 0:4 -map 0:9 -c copy -movflags +faststart trimmed.mp4`, is valid and does not use any non-existent options or parameters, unlike the failing example given.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All the options used in the command (`-i`, `-map`, `-c copy`, and `-movflags`) are valid and correctly formatted per the guidelines given in the man page.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore it passes. It correctly generates a functional and appropriate `ffmpeg` command based on the user's request."
