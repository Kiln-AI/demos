  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To make video.mp4 smaller for emailing, the most common method is to reduce its bitrate and resolution. This decreases file size while preserving acceptable quality. Here, we’ll:\n\n- Reduce the resolution to 720p (if it’s higher than that; adjust as needed).\n- Use H.264 video and AAC audio codecs for compatibility.\n- Set the video bitrate to 800k and the audio bitrate to 96k, which should be sufficient for email but may need adjustment depending on your file size limits (typical email limit is 25MB; tweak bitrate as necessary).\n- Use the yuv420p pixel format for universal playback.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- Original video is larger than 25MB.\n- 720p is an acceptable resolution for email viewing.\n- You want to retain decent visual and audio quality for email recipients.\n\nIf your email has a different size limit, adjust the video bitrate (-b:v) accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -b:v 800k -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 96k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart video_light.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- -vf scale=-2:720 rescales to 720 pixels in height, maintaining aspect ratio and even width.\n- -c:v libx264 -b:v 800k -crf 23 sets the codec and target bitrate and quality.\n- -preset fast keeps the encoding speed reasonable.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 96k sets audio to AAC at 96kbps.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility over different platforms.\n- -movflags +faststart optimizes for streaming and email attachment handling.\n\nIf your file is still too large, reduce the video bitrate further (e.g., 400k, 300k) and/or the resolution (e.g., 480p).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command is structured correctly to match the requirements of the user. It uses appropriate parameters for reducing file size while maintaining acceptable quality for emailing.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The generated command is valid, and all used options and flags are appropriate and match the ffmpeg syntax.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. All options specified in the command (such as `-i`, `-vf`, `-c:v`, `-b:v`, `-preset`, `-c:a`, `-b:a`, `-pix_fmt`, and `-movflags`) are correctly applied and conform to the expected syntax.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the error specified in the issue description, as the generated command adheres to requirements and is properly formatted. Thus, it should pass since it does not contain the issue."
