  "input": "I need to combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 from my input file recording.mov into a single MP4 file called output.mp4",
  "output": "To combine the video from stream 0:2 and audio from stream 1:3 of your input file into a single MP4, you can use ffmpeg's map option to select specific streams. We'll copy the streams without re-encoding (-c copy) for speed and quality preservation, assuming these streams are already compatible with MP4.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 1:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:2` selects the video stream 2 from the first input.\n- `-map 1:3` selects audio stream 3 from the second input.\n- `-c copy` copies streams as-is without re-encoding.\n- Outputs to `output.mp4`.\n\nNote: This assumes you have two input files or the `recording.mov` is being referred to with multiple input indices. If you only have one input file and want video stream 2 and audio stream 3 from it, you should use `-map 0:2 -map 0:3`. If you have multiple inputs, specify them accordingly. If your input is a single file, adjust to:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mov -map 0:2 -map 0:3 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nPlease clarify if you have multiple inputs.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Description Evaluation**: The output does not contain the issue described. The generated FFmpeg command correctly combines the specified video and audio streams from the provided input file without errors or improper parameters. The use of the `-map` option is appropriate, and the `-c copy` parameter efficiently handles the stream without re-encoding.\n\n2) **Comparison with Failure Example**: The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated is syntactically correct and does not contain any invalid parameters or typos. It effectively uses valid syntax for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It follows the correct syntax where options are applied to the specified input and output files, and it correctly uses the `-map` option for selecting specific input streams.\n\n4) **Overall Assessment**: The model's output is accurate and meets the user's request without issues. It effectively conveys the necessary command to achieve the task while providing a clear explanation of the parameters used. Thus, it successfully performs the task given by the user. \n\n**Conclusion**: The model's output passes all evaluation steps and does not contain any issues as described. It correctly fulfills the user's request."
