  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically using `ffmpeg`, we can use the `vstack` filter from the `filter_complex` option. `top_video.mp4` will be placed above `bottom_video.mp4`, and both will be scaled to the same width to ensure proper alignment (assuming they may differ in size). The audio will be merged with a slight fade if one is longer than the other.\n\nKey parameters:\n\n- `filter_complex vstack=inputs=2` vertically stacks the inputs.\n- `scale=1280:-2` ensures that both videos share the same width and maintains a proper aspect ratio for the height.\n- Audio will be mixed using a `amix` filter. If the videos have different lengths, the audio will be padded accordingly.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Both videos have the same aspect ratio and height ratio for the scaled width to align properly. If not, manual adjustments for height may be required.\n- Audio will be mixed if present; if only one video has audio, it will be used in the output.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v:0][1:v:0] scale=1280:-2 [left][right]; [left][right] vstack=inputs=2\" -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:a][1:a] amix=inputs=2:duration=longest:dropout_transition=3\" stacked.mp4\n```\n\nIf audio isnâ€™t required, the audio part can be omitted. Let me know if you want to add padding, labels, or other customizations.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described? \nYes, the output contains issues. The command produced by the model is not correct because it incorrectly uses two separate `-filter_complex` options instead of combining everything into one. The audio merging part is not properly integrated with the video stacking operation which could lead to an incorrect command execution.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output? \nYes, it is similar to the failure example because the command will likely fail to execute as intended due to the improper filtering structure. The command would not stack videos properly and blend them as specified.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nYes, the command does not adhere to the requirements for using `filter_complex`. The correct form of using filter_complex should have been to include all operations in one complex filter rather than using two separate filter_complex statements, which is against the directives outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\nYes, the command contains the issue and should fail. It does not produce a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements, which are to stack the two videos vertically in a single command. The execution of the command as produced would likely result in an error or an unexpected behavior."
