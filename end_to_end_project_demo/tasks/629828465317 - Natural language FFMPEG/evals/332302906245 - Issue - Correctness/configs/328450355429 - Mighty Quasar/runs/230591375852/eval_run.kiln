  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode subtitles into a video with a specific subtitle color using ffmpeg, you use the `subtitles` filter. You can specify a subtitle style to change the color by embedding styling within the filter parameters.\n\nIn this case, we'll hardcode `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv`, setting the subtitle font color to yellow. The color code for yellow in ASS style is `&H00FFFF00` (BBGGRR format with leading to specify alpha). \n\nThe basic command uses the `-vf subtitles=...` filter with styling options.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"subtitles=subtitles.srt:force_style='PrimaryColour=&H00FFFF00'\" -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf \"subtitles=...:force_style='PrimaryColour=...'\"` applies the subtitle and sets the yellow color.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Output file is `output.mkv`.\n\nAssumptions:\n- `movie.mkv` is the input video.\n- `subtitles.srt` is in the same directory.\n- You want to keep the original audio codec and quality.\n- You are okay with output file named `output.mkv`.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated appears to be well-formed, appropriate for the user's request to hardcode subtitles into a video with a specific color.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the output is not similar to the failure example. The command generated does not have any syntax errors or invalid options, and all parameters used are valid, making it likely to work as intended. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command does not appear to break any requirements dictated in the man page. The syntax and options used are valid and align with the expected format of the `ffmpeg` command. The `-vf \"subtitles=...:force_style='PrimaryColour=...'\"` correctly applies video filters and styles without conflicting with other options or commands.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generated a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements for hardcoding subtitles with a specific color. Thus, it should pass the evaluation."
