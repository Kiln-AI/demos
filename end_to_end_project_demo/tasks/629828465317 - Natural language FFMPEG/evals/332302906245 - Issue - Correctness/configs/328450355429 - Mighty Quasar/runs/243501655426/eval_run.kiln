  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": " To select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the file 'recording.mkv' and export them separately, we will use the `-map` option to specify the streams. Here are the commands for the video and audio:\n\n\n```bash\n\n# Video stream 12\n\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:12 -c:v copy -c:a copy video_stream_12.mp4\n\n\n# Audio stream 25\n\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:25 -c:v copy -c:a copy audio_stream_25.mp3\n\n```\n\n\nIn the above commands:\n\n- The `-map 0:12` option selects video stream 12 from the input file and copies it without re-encoding.\n\n- Similarly, `-map 0:25` selects audio stream 25.\n\n- The `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` options prevent re-encoding of the video and audio streams to maintain their original quality.\n\n- For the audio stream, '.mp3' format is chosen to make the audio streamable over the web, as '.m4a' is also a common format for audio files used in similar contexts.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. While the commands for selecting video stream 12 and audio stream 25 are appropriately formed, the output does not explicitly mention the 'copy' option for the audio command. Furthermore, the commands could be misinterpreted as exporting to incompatible file formats (e.g., exporting a video stream to an MP4 extension without specifying a codec). Therefore, it could potentially yield unexpected results.\n\n2) The model's output does not seem to be similar to the failure example provided. The 'extra_fast' preset does not appear in the output, and overall, the commands seem structured correctly. However, the use of the '.mp4' for video stream and '.mp3' for the audio stream could mislead if the necessary parameters or codecs were not indicated.\n\n3) The commands do not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of the `-map` option is correctly applied, and the 'copy' codec is correctly used to avoid re-encoding and maintain quality. However, while the commands seem theoretically correct, the model should ensure to provide a more robust explanation for the format appropriateness or codec usage to prevent ambiguity.\n\n4) Given these observations, I would conclude that the output does contain issues as described in the evaluation steps, specifically in clarity and completeness regarding file formats and codec choices. Thus, it should fail for the provided task."
