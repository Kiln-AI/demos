  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate a video 90 degrees clockwise, you can use the `transpose=1` filter which efficiently performs this rotation. For advanced noise reduction, `hqdn3d` is a high-quality denoising filter available in ffmpeg, and setting its parameters to higher values applies a stronger filter. For the strongest noise reduction, use high (but reasonable) values in the filter parameters.\n\n- `-vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=8:8:6:4\"` applies the 90Â° clockwise rotation andStrong denoising: \n  - `8:8:6:4` corresponds to temporal (Luma, Chroma scales) and spatial (Luma, Chroma scales). Higher values apply stronger processing.\n  \nNote: Excessively high values can cause blurring or other artifacts, so adjust based on your source.\n\nHere is a recommended command line:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,hqdn3d=8:8:6:4\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18` for high-quality H.264 encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` to copy the original audio without re-encoding.\n\nThis command performs an efficient, high-quality rotation and severe noise reduction while preserving audio. Adjust the `hqdn3d` parameters if you detect unwanted artifacts or need lighter filtering.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe model's output does not contain an issue as it generates a command that should work correctly given the user requirements for rotating a video and applying noise reduction. The components of the command are appropriate for the specified tasks and follow the expected syntax of `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output does not resemble the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model includes valid options without syntax errors or non-existent presets. It correctly employs the needed filters and parameters.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command does not break any requirements from the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly applies the input file option `-i`, uses video filter options with `-vf`, specifies the video codec with `-c:v`, and ensures that audio is copied without re-encoding. All options are applied in the correct order and conform to the syntax rules illustrated in the `ffmpeg` documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nThe output does not contain the issue and should pass as the command generated is correct and meets the requirements from the user's input."
