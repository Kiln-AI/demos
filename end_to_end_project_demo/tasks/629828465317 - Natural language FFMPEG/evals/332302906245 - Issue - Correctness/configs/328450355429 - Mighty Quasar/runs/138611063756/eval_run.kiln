  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To stack two videos vertically, you can use the `vstack` filter in ffmpeg. This requires the two videos to have the same width and pixel format. If the widths differ, you might want to scale them first to match.\n\nHere's the basic command to vertically stack two videos:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"vstack=inputs=2\" stacked.mp4\n```\n\nIf the widths are different, you may want to scale them to the same width first, for example:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=iw:ih[top];[1:v]scale=iw:ih[bottom];[top][bottom]vstack=inputs=2\" stacked.mp4\n```\n\nBut the simplest approach assumes same widths:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"vstack=inputs=2\" stacked.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. It provided a correct ffmpeg command to stack two videos vertically using the `vstack` filter. The command meets the userâ€™s requirement, providing a valid ffmpeg command that works correctly in theory.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated is both syntactically correct and utilizes the appropriate ffmpeg filter. The failure example presented includes a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), while the model's response does not feature any invalid commands or parameters. \n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nThe command provided in the model's output does not break any requirements from the man page. It uses correct syntax for both input files and the `-filter_complex` option, adhering to the order of inputs and outputs. The command does not violate any specifications outlined for ffmpeg.\n\n4) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nSince the model's output does not contain any of the specified issues from the user message, it should pass this evaluation. The command is correct and meets the user's request. Therefore, the final evaluation is that it does not contain the issue and successfully fulfills the requirements."
