  "input": "Map the third video stream and second audio stream from my source file multi.avi into a single output file called final.mp4",
  "output": "Here we map the third video stream and the second audio stream from the `multi.avi` source file to a new output file called `final.mp4`. We use the stream indexes directly with `-map` to select the desired streams. The stream index `3` is for the third video and `2` is for the second audio stream since they are zero-based (i.e., zero-indexing denotes the first stream).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 3:3 -map 2:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy -y final.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n\n- `-i multi.avi`: specifies the input file.\n- `-map 3:3`: maps the third video stream from the source to the output.\n- `-map 2:2`: maps the second audio stream from the source to the output.\n- `-c:v copy`: copies the video stream as-is without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy`: copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-y`: overwrite the output file without asking if it already exists.\n\nThis command assumes:\n\n1. Multi.avi contains at least four video/audio streams (0-based indexing).\n2. You want to keep the original quality of the third video stream and the second audio stream by copying them instead of re-encoding.\n3. The desired final.mp4 file will be saved in the current working directory or you can specify a full path.\n4. There are no additional post-processing requirements. If additional filtering or adjustments were needed, we'd include them using the `-filter:v` or `-filter:a` options accordingly within the command.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command it generated is valid and seems to correctly map the specified video and audio streams. Therefore, it properly matches the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command produced does not contain any invalid options or parameters (e.g., a non-existent preset) and adheres to the correct syntax for the `ffmpeg` command line tool.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements set forth in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the proper syntax about mapping streams, and uses valid options relevant to the context of the operation. The output command aligns with how `ffmpeg` stream mapping is to be performed.\n\n4) Considering all the above, the model's output does not contain the issue stated and thus would pass the evaluation. The command it provided is correct and functions as expected, meeting the user's request for mapping specific streams to the new output file."
