  "output": "To extract audio from a video and save it as both **320kbps MP3** and **lossless WAV** in one command, use `ffmpeg` with two output streams. Here's the technique:\n\n- `-i input.mp4`: Specifies the input video file.\n- `-vn`: Disables video stream copying for each output.\n- First output (`output.mp3`): Uses `libmp3lame` (MP3 encoder) and sets the bitrate (`-b:a 320k`).\n- Second output (`output.wav`): Uses `pcm_s16le` (lossless PCM audio with 16-bit Little Endian) for WAV format.\n\nThis ensures both formats leverage the same source audio stream efficiently. Assumes the input file (`input.mp4`) exists and has a single audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 320k output.mp3 -vn -c:a pcm_s16le output.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated is correct for extracting audio from the video file and saving it in both MP3 and WAV formats. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not contain any erroneous parameters or invalid options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, options for disabling the video stream for audio extraction, and uses appropriate codecs for both MP3 and WAV outputs.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output does not contain the issue described, it does not resemble a failing output, and it aligns with the requirements of the ffmpeg man page. Therefore, it passes."
