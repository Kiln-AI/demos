  "input": "I have a 60fps video, `slomo.mp4`. Convert it to 24fps by dropping frames.",
  "output": "To convert a 60fps video to 24fps by dropping frames, you can use the `fps` video filter in `ffmpeg`. This filter will re-time the video to the specified frame rate by discarding frames, which is suitable for reducing the frame rate without re-sampling or interpolating.\n\n- `fps=24` sets the target frame rate to 24fps.\n- The default settings for audio and video codecs will be used, which are generally safe for most use cases, but you might want to specify them for consistency.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i slomo.mp4 -vf fps=24 output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: The input video is in MP4 format and uses a compatible codec (like H.264). If the audio needs to be adjusted or the video codec is different, additional parameters may be needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model is appropriate for the task requested, which is to convert a 60fps video to 24fps by dropping frames. The `fps` filter is correctly used to achieve this.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated does not reference any non-existent presets or parameters that would cause it to fail. Instead, it uses valid and well-documented options for the `ffmpeg` tool.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The usage of the `-vf fps=24` option to set the frame rate is correct and complies with the specifications outlined. Additionally, it doesn't violate any other constraints or requirements mentioned in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation steps above, the model's output should be assessed as passing the evaluation since it meets the task requirements, uses valid syntax, and adheres to the `ffmpeg` man page without any faults."
