  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract only the first video stream and the third audio stream from movie.mkv into final.mp4, use stream mapping to select the desired streams. The `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream, and `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (index starts at 0). Copy codecs to avoid re-encoding unless necessary.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing and to preserve quality. If the audio codec is not compatible with MP4, transcoding might be needed, but this assumes compatibility.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any errors based on the user requirements. The command it generated correctly extracts the first video stream and the third audio stream, and uses the `-map` options correctly to specify which streams to include in the output file.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy final.mp4`) utilizes valid options and follows the correct format of the ffmpeg command based on the requirements given, unlike the `extra_fast` preset which does not exist.\n\n3) Reviewing the man page for ffmpeg, the command generated does not break any specified requirements. It correctly uses the mapping options and copy directives for both video and audio without attempting improper or unsupported codecs based on the parameters.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does not contain the issue as described. The command generated will execute properly according to ffmpeg's requirements, aligning with the userâ€™s request to extract specific streams into a new output file. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
