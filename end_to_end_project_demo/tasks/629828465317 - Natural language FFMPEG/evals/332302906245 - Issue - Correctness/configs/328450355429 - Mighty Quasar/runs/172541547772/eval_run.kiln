  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from input.mov into a single output, you use the `-map` option with the stream index. The first parameter is input, and the second is `-map 0:<stream_index>`, where `0` refers to the input file, and `<stream_index>` is the stream number you want:\n\n- For video streams, use `-map 0:v:<stream_index>` (if more than one video stream).\n- For audio streams, use `-map 0:a:<stream_index>` (if more than one audio stream).\n\nTo extract a single output container with all streams, you can use `-c copy` (stream copying) to avoid re-encoding, or you can specify codecs as needed (e.g., `-c:v copy`, `-c:a copy`).\n\n**Here's how to extract the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream:**\n\nAssuming your input file has more than 6 video streams and more than 13 audio streams:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:7 -map 0:a:14 -c copy output_with_streams.mp4\n```\n\nIf you had fewer streams than expected and want to ensure all streams are included, you can map all streams safely using negative indexes:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0 -c copy output_all_streams.mp4\n```\n\nThis extracts all streams from the input.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the issue description. The command accurately uses the `-map` option to select the specified video and audio streams from the input file, which aligns with the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example provided. The output command correctly uses existing FFmpeg options and syntax to create a valid command without any obvious errors, unlike the failure example which uses an incorrect preset that does not exist.\n\n3) Based on the FFmpeg man page, the command adheres to the requirements and does not break any rules. The use of `-map 0:v:7` and `-map 0:a:14` appropriately targets the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream as specified by the user. Additionally, the use of `-c copy` is consistent with standard practice for copying streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Considering all of the points above, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command is valid, matches the user's requirements, and adheres to the FFmpeg documentation. The output should be marked as passing."
