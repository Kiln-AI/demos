  "input": "I need to select stream 15 for video and stream 22 for audio from my input file with many tracks called source.mkv",
  "output": "To select specific audio and video streams from a file with multiple tracks, you can use the `-map` option followed by the stream numbers. \n\nHere's the command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:v:15 -map 0:a:22 output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map 0:v:15` selects stream 15 for the video track (0 is the stream type, v is the video stream, and 15 is the stream number).\n- `-map 0:a:22` selects stream 22 for the audio track.\n- `output.mp4` is the output file name.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- All audio and video streams are contained within the first container (container 0). If the streams are in a different container, the container number would be specified after the `map` option (e.g., `-map 1:v:15 -map 1:a:22`).\n- The stream numbers match the order in which the streams appear in the container. If the stream order is not consistent, you may need to use a different approach.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command correctly uses the `-map` option to select the specific audio and video streams from the input file and outputs the command in the correct format that should work as intended.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given example of a failing output. The output command it provided is valid and does not contain any incorrect or nonexistent options.\n\n3) The command complies with the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It correctly applies the `-map` options to specify the desired streams and formats the command properly.\n\n4) Given that the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass the evaluation successfully."
