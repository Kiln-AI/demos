  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using H.264 encoding with both constant bitrate of 5000k and constant rate factor of 18 for optimal quality control.",
  "output": "CRF (Constant Rate Factor) and CBR (Constant Bitrate) are two different modes for controlling the output quality/bitrate in x264 (the H.264 encoder). You can’t use them simultaneously:  \n- **CRF 18** gives constant perceptual quality and is preferred for optimal quality.\n- **Bitrate 5000k (CBR)** enforces a more constant file size/bitrate, sacrificing some quality adaptability.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- If you prioritize *quality*, use `-crf 18` (recommended for most cases).\n- If you require *exact average bitrate*, use `-b:v 5000k` (with `-minrate`, `-maxrate`, and `-bufsize` to enforce true CBR).\n\n**Example 1 – Optimal Quality (CRF 18):**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output_crf18.mp4\n```\n\n**Example 2 – Constant Bitrate (CBR 5000k):**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libx264 -b:v 5000k -minrate 5000k -maxrate 5000k -bufsize 10000k -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 192k -movflags +faststart output_cbr5000k.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- You want AAC audio (`-c:a aac -b:a 192k`) for broad compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` for web streaming.\n- Replace `input.mkv` and output filenames as needed.\n\n**Summary:** Use only one quality/bandwidth control mode per encode. Choose CRF for quality or CBR for exact bitrate.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The commands it generated correctly use either the CRF or CBR encoding method, each with appropriate parameters. The distinction is clearly explained, and the commands themselves are valid, so they should work correctly according to the requirements provided by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The output commands are well-formed, and there are no incorrect or nonsensical options such as a non-existent preset. Both commands utilize valid options supported by FFmpeg, complying with the requirements for video conversion and encoding.\n\n3) Based on the FFmpeg man page, the commands do not break any requirements dictated in the man page. Each command uses valid options, and the order of options is properly adhered to. They specify a valid input file, pertinent encoding options, and a correct output file format.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain the issue described, does not resemble the failure example, and does not violate any requirements from the man page, it should pass this evaluation."
