  "input": "I need to convert a video file and set the bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps for archival purposes.",
  "output": "Setting a video bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps (terabits per second) is impractical and likely unnecessary, even for archival purposes. Such an extraordinarily high bitrate is far beyond the capability of any current consumer or professional storage and playback system. Typically, archival video bitrates range from tens to hundreds of Mbps (megabits per second), not terabits.\n\nIf you truly need to specify a very high bitrate for archival purposes, you should use a realistic, attainable value (e.g., 64 Mbps = 64000000 bps). ffmpeg's -b:v parameter sets the target video bitrate. For extremely high-quality archival, lossless codecs like FFV1, HuffYUV, or ProRes are preferred over setting a massive constant bitrate on a lossy codec.\n\nAssuming you meant 64 Mbps (a common high-quality archival setting) and want to use H.264 for compatibility or FFV1 for lossless archival, here are examples for both:\n\n**1. Lossy archival with H.264 at 64 Mbps:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 64M -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv422p -c:a copy output_archival.mp4\n```\n\n**2. Lossless archival with FFV1 (preferred for true archival):**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v ffv1 -level 3 -c:a copy output_archival.mkv\n```\n\n- Replace input.mp4 with your source.\n- For bitrate, use `64M` (megabits), not Tbps.\n- FFV1 is a lossless intra-frame codec suitable for long-term archival.\n\n**Summary:** \n- Terabit-level bitrate is not usable.\n- Use `64M` for 64 megabits per second.\n- For best archival, consider lossless coding (FFV1).\n- For high-quality but lossy archival, use H.264 with `-b:v 64M`.\n\nIf you need a specific command for a large, but realistic bitrate, please confirm.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The commands provided are valid and correct in the context of ffmpeg usage, taking into account current knowledge about bitrates and codec choices. The model correctly recognizes that setting a bitrate to 64 Tbps is impractical and suggests a realistic alternative.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The commands suggested by the model are valid and are formatted correctly without any syntax errors or invalid parameter names.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the commands generated do not break any requirements. The `-b:v` option is correctly used for specifying the video bitrate in bits per second (with appropriate units), and the codecs chosen are valid. The commands align with the requirements specified in the context of the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) Therefore, I conclude that the model's output does **not** contain the issue described. It has handled the user request appropriately and provided valid ffmpeg commands as well as explanations."
