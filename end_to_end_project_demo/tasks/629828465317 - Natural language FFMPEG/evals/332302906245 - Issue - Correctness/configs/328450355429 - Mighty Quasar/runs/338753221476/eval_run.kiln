  "input": "Please make `video.mp4` smaller. It's too big to email.",
  "output": "To make `video.mp4` smaller for easier emailing, you'll want to reduce its file size by lowering the video bitrate or increasing the compression (higher CRF value), and optionally resizing the resolution or removing unnecessary streams (like extra audio tracks or subtitles).\n\nHereâ€™s a common approach that balances good quality and significantly reduced size:\n- Use H.264 (`libx264`) with a CRF (Constant Rate Factor) of 28 for high compression. (Default is 23; higher means more compression, lower quality.)\n- Set `-preset veryfast` for faster encoding (change to `medium` or `slow` if you want smaller size for same CRF at the cost of speed).\n- Remove any additional audio tracks, and reduce audio bitrate.\n- Optionally, resize to 720p if the original is higher (commented out, but can be included).\n\nAssumption: You mainly want to keep the main video and one audio track for emailing.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 28 -preset veryfast -c:a aac -b:a 96k -movflags +faststart -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 output_smaller.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c:v libx264 -crf 28`: Compress video with reasonable quality/size trade-off.\n- `-preset veryfast`: Speeds up encoding (change to `slow` for even smaller files at same CRF).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 96k`: Compress audio to AAC at 96 kbps.\n- `-movflags +faststart`: Required for emails and streaming so video starts quickly.\n- `-map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0`: Keeps only the first video and first audio track (removes extras).\n\nIf you want to also resize (for even smaller size), add `-vf scale=-2:720` after `-i video.mp4`.\n\nLet me know if you want to target a specific file size or want to keep a certain resolution!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain an issue as described. The command it generated is valid and should work correctly based on the user request to reduce the file size of `video.mp4`. The suggestions made (such as adjusting CRF, bitrate, and removing additional audio tracks) are relevant to achieving the task.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the failure example. The command it generated does not contain a non-existent preset like \"extra_fast\", and all parameters used are syntactically and contextually correct.\n\n3) The command provided in the output does **not** break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. All options specified (such as `-c:v`, `-crf`, `-preset`, etc.) are valid and appropriately ordered. Moreover, the use of `-map` to selectively retain streams is acceptable within the guidelines of the ffmpeg command syntax.\n\n4) Therefore, considering the above evaluations, the model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it properly fulfills the user's request without generating errors or invalid command parameters. This indicates that the model's performance is satisfactory in this case."
