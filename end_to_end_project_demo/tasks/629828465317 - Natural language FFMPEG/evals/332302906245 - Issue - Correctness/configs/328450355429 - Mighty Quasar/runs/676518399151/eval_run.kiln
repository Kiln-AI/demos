  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order, you'll construct a filter chain using the `-vf` option in `ffmpeg`. Each filter is separated by a comma, and they are applied in the order they appear in the chain.  For the best possible output, it's important to consider the order of these filters as denoising can have an impact on edge detection.\n\nHere's how to format the command. I am assuming you will use the `hqdn3d`, `nlmeans`, and `unsharp` filters. The assumption is that you want to remove temporal noise first using `hqdn3d`, then apply spatial denoising using `nlmeans`, and finally apply edge enhancement using `unsharp`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"hqdn3d,nlmeans,unsharp\" output.mp4\n```\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The output provided by the model generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that matches the user's requirements for applying a filter chain.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command generated by the model does not use any invalid options or presets that would cause it to fail. Instead, it constructs the filter chain properly.\n\n3) Upon reviewing the man page for `ffmpeg`, the command does not break any requirements. The filters used (`hqdn3d`, `nlmeans`, and `unsharp`) are appropriately formatted within the `-vf` option and are valid filters.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described and successfully generates a working command that aligns with `ffmpeg` requirements. Thus, it passes the evaluation."
