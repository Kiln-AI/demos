  "input": "Extract audio from my video file and save it as both MP3 with 320kbps bitrate and as a lossless WAV file in one command.",
  "output": "To extract audio from your video file and save it as both MP3 (320kbps) and WAV (lossless) in a single command, we can run two separate audio encoding processes within one `ffmpeg` invocation using two outputs. \n\nKey details:\n- `-vn`: Disables video recording, so only the audio is extracted.\n- `-acodec mp3 -b:a 320k`: Encodes the audio to MP3 format with a 320 kbps bitrate.\n- `-acodec pcm_s16le -f wav`: Encodes the audio to lossless WAV format using a signed 16-bit PCM sample format.\n- Assumes your input file has a single audio stream.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vn -acodec mp3 -b:a 320k output.mp3 -vn -acodec pcm_s16le -f wav output.wav\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue. The command generated is incorrect because it tries to apply `-vn` (which disables video recording) and `-acodec` (to specify audio codec) multiple times, which does not follow the correct usage of parameters in ffmpeg as per its man page. The correct command should specify the outputs in a way that maintains the audio stream while applying transformations individually to each output format. In addition, `-acodec` is not a recognized way to set an encoder for the output format; the correct option should be `-c:a`.\n\n2) The output is similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command incorrectly tries to use options that apply to separate files (outputs) incorrectly by combining them in one line while using `-vn` multiple times, which is incorrect usage per the ffmpeg command structure.\n\n3) The command does break requirements dictated in the man page. Options should be applied to the next specified output, which means the `-vn` and `-acodec` options should be specified sequentially for each output file. The output format for each stream should also ensure that they are correctly separated with their respective audio codec specifications.\n\nOverall, the command cannot run successfully as it is currently structured, leading to the conclusion that the model's output fails to meet the user's request correctly."
