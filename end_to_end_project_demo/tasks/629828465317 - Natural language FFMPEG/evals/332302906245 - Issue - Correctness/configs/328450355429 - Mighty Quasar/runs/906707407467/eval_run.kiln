  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the first video stream and the third audio stream from movie.mkv and save them into final.mp4, you can use stream mapping with `-map`. \n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from the first input (index 0).\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (audio streams are zero-indexed, so 2 means the third).\n- Using `-c copy` will copy the selected streams without re-encoding for a fast lossless operation.\n- Ensure the output container supports the codecs in the input streams; since MP4 has limited codec support, if streams are not compatible, you might need to re-encode (but this command assumes compatibility).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command provided accurately reflects the user's request to extract the specified video and audio streams from the input file and produce an output file. The mappings for the streams are correctly specified, and it uses the `-c copy` option, which is appropriate for this task as it allows for a fast and lossless extraction without re-encoding.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The command is correctly formed and does not contain any invalid options or made-up preset names. Therefore, it should function as intended without any errors. \n\n3) The command conforms to the requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The use of `-map` for selecting specific streams from the input file and `-c copy` for copying those streams directly to the output file is consistent with the documented behavior of FFmpeg commands. It follows the expected syntax and logic as outlined in the \"Options\" and \"Mapping\" sections of the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output should **pass** as it correctly meets the requirements specified by the user and adheres to the guidelines provided in the FFmpeg man page."
