  "input": "I want to apply color correction and noise reduction in a filter chain. Please use -vf 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5' to adjust colors and reduce noise.",
  "output": "The technique involves applying multiple filters in a chain to enhance color and reduce noise. The 'eq' filter adjusts brightness and contrast for color correction, while 'hqdn3d' performs high-quality noise reduction. Combining these filters with a comma prepares a chain that applies both effects sequentially.\n\nAssuming your input is 'input.mp4' and you want to output to 'output.mp4' with H.264 encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- The filters are chained with a comma inside quotes.\n- '-c:v libx264' encodes video with H.264.\n- '-crf 23' specifies quality.\n- '-preset medium' balances encoding speed and compression.\n- '-c:a copy' copies the original audio stream without re-encoding for simplicity.\n\nAdjust input/output filenames as needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is well-structured, applies the required filters using the `-vf` option correctly, and specifies the video codec with `-c:v`. All parameters in the command are valid as per the FFmpeg guidelines.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command it generated does not contain any incorrect options like `-preset extra_fast`, which does not exist. All generated options are valid.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The options and parameters provided, such as the `-vf` filter chain and codec specifications, comply with the expected syntax and order for FFmpeg commands.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it correctly generates a fully functional command that meets the requirements specified by the user. Therefore, it passes the evaluation criteria."
