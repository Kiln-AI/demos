  "output": "You're on the right track! To apply multiple video filters together in `ffmpeg`, chain them in the order you want (as you did). Here, `yadif=mode=1` deinterlaces using the YADIF filter in \"bob\" mode, `scale=1920:1080` resizes the video to Full HD, and `unsharp` sharpens the image.\n\n- The filters are specified inside a single `-vf` parameter, separated by commas, and must be quoted or escaped.\n- Make sure your shell doesn't misinterpret the quotes.\n\nHere's how you would run it (assuming your input is `input.mp4` and output is `output.mp4`):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"yadif=mode=1,scale=1920:1080,unsharp=luma_msize_x=5:luma_msize_y=5:luma_amount=1.0\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- You're working with a progressive output (since you scale after deinterlacing).\n- Output codec/settings are defaultâ€”specify additional codecs as needed.\n- `\"...\"` works in most shells for quoting; use `'...'` if you're on Windows CMD.\n\nLet me know if you want to adjust audio, codec, or bitrate settings too!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues as described in the issue description. The command generated matches the user's request for applying temporal and spatial filters, and it correctly uses the `-vf` parameter for chaining multiple filters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command produced is valid and utilizes recognized ffmpeg functionalities without using incorrect presets or options.\n\n3) The generated command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. It follows the correct order of options and applies the video filter options appropriately.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output successfully fulfills the requirements of the task without any detected issues. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
