  "input": "Please convert this video and set the bitrate to 50 Gbps to preserve all the detail.",
  "output": "Setting the bitrate to 50 Gbps (50,000,000 kbps) is extremely high and uncommon for typical video encoding tasks, typically used in professional or archival workflows to preserve maximum detail. However, you should ensure the output container and codec support such high bitrates.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the same input codec but set the bitrate explicitly, or use a high-quality codec like H.264 or H.265 with a constant bitrate (CBR) mode.\n\nHereâ€™s a command using libx264 (H.264) codec with a very high constant bitrate of 50,000,000 kbps:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 50000000k -preset veryslow -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec to H.264.\n- `-b:v 50000000k` sets the video bitrate to 50 Gbps (50 million kbps).\n- `-preset veryslow` maximizes quality.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n\nNote: Make sure you replace `input.mp4` and `output.mp4` with your actual filenames. Also, at such a high bitrate, output file sizes will be enormous.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly applies the specified bitrate (50 Gbps) to the video conversion task. The command is also syntactically correct and follows the requirements for `ffmpeg` usage as specified in the provided man page.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command it generated does not contain any incorrect options like a non-existent preset (e.g., `extra_fast`). Instead, the command uses valid parameters and correct syntax required by the `ffmpeg` tool.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. All used options are valid according to `ffmpeg` specifications. The `-b:v 50000000k` option correctly sets the bitrate, and the use of `-c:v libx264` and `-preset veryslow` are valid options. There is no syntax error nor an invalid flag that contradicts the described usage in the man page.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output is appropriate, and it does not contain any issues as described. The command appears to be accurately constructed for the task of setting a very high video bitrate. Therefore, it should pass evaluation."
