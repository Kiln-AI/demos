  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from `video.mp4` and save it as a FLAC file with maximum compression, use the `-vn` flag to disable video, `-c:a flac` to specify the FLAC audio codec, and `-compression_level 8` to set the highest compression level for FLAC (which may take longer to encode but reduces file size). The default sample rate and channel layout are preserved unless specified otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -c:a flac -compression_level 8 output.flac\n```\n\n**Assumptions**:  \n- The input file is named `video.mp4`.  \n- You want to retain the original audio quality (FLAC is lossless by default).  \n- The output file is named `output.flac`.  \n- The user is aware that `-compression_level 8` may increase encoding time but optimize storage.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "The evaluation of the model's performance on the task can proceed as follows:\n\n1) **Issue Contained**: The model's output does not contain any syntactical or command-related issues as per the `<issue_description>`. The command it generated appears valid, and it meets the user's requirements for extracting audio from the video file and saving it as a FLAC file with the maximum compression level.\n\n2) **Similarity to Failing Output**: The command does not resemble the failing example (`ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4`), as it does not use any incorrect parameters or flags. The `-compression_level` argument specified in the output is correct and applicable to the FLAC codec, which distinguishes this output from the failure example.\n\n3) **Man Page Compliance**: According to the FFmpeg man page, the options used in this command (`-vn` to disable video and `-c:a flac` to specify the audio codec) adhere to the requirements outlined. The `-compression_level 8` option is valid for the FLAC codec, and it correctly applies to the audio extraction operation without conflicting with the general rules for options.\n\n4) **Overall Conclusion**: Given that the command is workable, does not present any errors or invalid options, and complies with the requirements established in the man page, the model has successfully fulfilled the task without issues. Therefore, it passes the evaluation based on the criteria provided."
