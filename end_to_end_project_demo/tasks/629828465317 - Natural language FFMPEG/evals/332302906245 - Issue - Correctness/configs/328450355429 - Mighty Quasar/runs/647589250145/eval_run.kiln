  "input": "I want to overlay text on my video and also apply a blur effect. How do I chain multiple video filters with proper syntax?",
  "output": "To overlay text on your video and apply a blur effect, you can chain multiple video filters using the `filter_complex` option in FFmpeg. This allows you to apply a sequence of filters in a single command. The text overlay filter (`drawtext`) is used to add text, and the blur filter (`boxblur`) can be applied to the entire video or specific regions.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want the text to be overlaid on top of the video.\n- You want a simple blur effect applied to the entire video.\n- You are using a modern version of FFmpeg that supports these filters.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v][0:a] boxblur=5:tpb=0.5, drawtext='text=Hello World\\\\nWelcome!': fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf: fontsize=24: fontcolor=white: x=(w-text_w)/2: y=(h-text_h)/2\" output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `boxblur=5:tpb=0.5` applies a blur effect with a radius of 5 and temporal blur parameter of 0.5.\n- `drawtext='text=Hello World\\\\nWelcome!': fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf: fontsize=24: fontcolor=white: x=(w-text_w)/2: y=(h-text_h)/2` overlays the text in the center of the video. Replace the font path with the actual path to your font file if needed.\n- The filter complex syntax `[0:v][0:a]` refers to the video and audio streams of the input.\n- The output video will have both the blur effect and the text overlay.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command is not fully compliant with the correct syntax for chaining multiple filters with `filter_complex`, which typically should include proper bracket notation for separating different filter chains. The specific error in the command is that it treats both the blur and drawtext filters as if they are a single linear chain which can be processed together, without proper separation.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example given. While both present incorrect usage, the nature of the issue is different. The command provided by the model does not contain a completely incorrect option, such as a nonexistent preset, but rather an incorrect syntax for chaining filters which could lead to failure.\n\n3) The command generated does violate the requirements dictated in the man page because it incorrectly formats the `filter_complex` section. The proper syntax should separate the filters with semicolons and wrap the entire filter chain within square brackets, rather than attempting to chain them directly in a single stream. In the given command, the way the filters are presented and chained would likely lead to an error in execution.\n\n4) Given that the command does contain errors in syntax that can lead to execution failure, it can be said to have issues that warrant a \"fail\" status for the model's output based on the criteria mentioned."
