  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio and video filters together. Use -vf 'scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0' -af 'volume=2.0,highpass=f=200' to scale, sharpen, increase volume and apply high-pass filter.",
  "output": "You're applying multiple video and audio filters in sequence:\n\n- `-vf 'scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0'` scales the video to 640x480, then sharpens it with an unsharp mask.\n- `-af 'volume=2.0,highpass=f=200'` doubles the audio volume, then applies a high-pass filter at 200 Hz.\n\nAssuming your input file is named `input.mp4` and you want to output as `output.mp4`:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=640:480,unsharp=5:5:1.0\" -af \"volume=2.0,highpass=f=200\" output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command processes both the video and audio streams with your specified filters. You can add codec options as needed for desired output format and quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not seem to contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command appropriately implements the requested audio and video filters without any syntax errors or unsupported options. The command appears to meet the user's requirements satisfactorily. \n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command generated by the model is correct regarding the syntax and the parameters used (i.e., `-vf` and `-af` filters). There are no nonexistent options or misspellings that would cause the command to fail. \n\n3) The command doesn't seem to break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The parameters `-vf` and `-af`, as well as the filter parameters used (`scale`, `unsharp`, `volume`, `highpass`), are valid and supported according to the FFmpeg documentation. The output file format is also appropriately specified, and the order of options aligns with the established guidelines. \n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
