  "output": "To extract specific streams from a file, you can use the `-map` option to select the desired streams explicitly. In your case, you're extracting the second video stream (0:1) and the fourth audio stream (0:3).\n\n- `-map 0:1` selects the second video stream.\n- `-map 0:3` selects the fourth audio stream.\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing and no quality loss.\n- Output format is MP4 (`result.mp4`).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:1 -map 0:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command it generated correctly reflects the user's request to extract specific streams from the input file without any errors or invalid options. Since the parameters are appropriate and match the user's requirements, we can conclude that it works correctly.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command does not contain invalid parameters, and it utilizes the correct syntax for extracting specific streams with the `-map` option, which is valid for FFmpeg. Thus, it does not present any mistake comparable to the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. It follows proper syntax and order of options, using `-map` to select the correct streams and `-c copy` to copy them without re-encoding. The parameters used fit correctly into the functionality described in the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is constructed correctly, meets the user's requirements, and adheres to FFmpeg guidelines. Therefore, it passes this evaluation."
