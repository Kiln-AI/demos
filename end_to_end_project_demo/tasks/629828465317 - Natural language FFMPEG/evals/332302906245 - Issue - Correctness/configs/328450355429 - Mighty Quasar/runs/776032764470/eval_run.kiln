  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a source file in ffmpeg, use the -map option with the stream specifiers. Here, you want the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from complex.avi:\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (streams are zero-indexed, so 0:v:1 is the first input (0), video type (v), second stream (1)).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (audio type (a), stream index 3).\n\nIf you want to keep the streams unchanged, just re-encode or copy them as needed. Here, I will demonstrate copy streams first with stream mapping. If you want to re-encode, I'll include an example as shown below.\n\nExample command copying the selected streams (useful if codecs are compatible with the container):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nReplace output.mkv with your desired filename and container. \n\nIf you want to re-encode the selected streams instead, specify encoding options accordingly, for example:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_reencoded.mp4\n```\n\nThis example re-encodes video with H.264 and audio with AAC, suitable for many uses. Adjust codecs as needed for your application.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It generates a valid `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements of mapping the second video stream and the fourth audio stream from the input file. The explanation provided justifies the stream mapping correctly and the use of `-c copy` indicates that the selected streams will remain unchanged, which is appropriate given the task.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command correctly uses `-map` options to specify the streams and does not contain any non-existent options or parameters, such as an invalid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page of `ffmpeg`. The use of `-i` for input, `-map` for stream mapping, and `-c copy` to copy the selected streams conform to the expected syntax and behavior of `ffmpeg`.\n\n4) In conclusion, the model's output does not contain the issue described, passes the check against the failure example, and adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page for `ffmpeg`. Therefore, the evaluation is successful and should be marked as a pass."
