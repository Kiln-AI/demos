  "input": "Convert my video to both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in the same output file",
  "output": "To simultaneously encode your video with both H.264 and H.265 codecs in the same output file, you must create a muxing container that supports both codec streams (like MKV), but not MP4 because MP4 does not allow multiple video streams. MKV is best for this use case as it supports multiple video tracks.\n\nYou can use stream copy (`-c copy`) to mux both H.264 and H.265 streams from input video but this only works when the input has both codecs already demuxed (not typical; generally encodes using `-c:v`). To make a clean output file, encode each video stream separately.\n\nIf you want H.264 and H.265 streams in MKV, output should include both, named differently (e.g., with different codec tags) since format doesn't support two video streams with same codec.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v:0 libx264 -c:v:1 libx265 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:v:1 output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i input.mp4`: Input the original video.\n- `-c:v:0 libx264`: Encode first video stream (`v:0`) as H.264.\n- `-c:v:1 libx265`: Encode second video stream (`v:1`) as H.265.\n- `-map 0:v:0`: Map first video stream (original or new H.264).\n- `-map 0:v:1`: Map second video stream (original or new H.265).\n- `output.mkv`: Container that supports both H.264 and H.265.\n\nIf you need a single video track containing both codecs at different positions or simultaneously in the same packet, `ffmpeg` cannot do that directly. MKV containers support two video streams but not combined stream types. Consider creating a `mux` playlist or mux the streams into the same track by remuxing, which is possible only if both codecs exist in the input, but then you lose encoding quality.\n\nIf your input does not include both codecs, a recommended two-step approach is:\n\n1. Extract H.264 using `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy h264_stream.mp4` if exists.\n\n2. Extract H.265 using `ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -c:a copy h265_stream.mp4` if exists.\n\nThen, mux both streams into MKV.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- **Multi-stream container approach**: MKV with two video streams named differently.\n- Not supported: Single video stream with both codecs combined or muxed simultaneously.\n\nIf you want **two separate** videos with H.264 and H.265, output will be 2 files.\n\n---\n\nIf you want to combine 2 video streams (for example, stereo video streams) but this is different:\n\nTo **create a stereo video** with one stream is impossible since video data is single-channel of pixels, therefore, H.264 or H.265 streams are always single per video stream.\n\n---\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file is `input.mp4` containing H.264. You want decoded H.264 and another H.265.\n- Using MKV container for mutli-codec multiplexing.\n\n---\n\nOutput command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v:0 libx264 -c:v:1 libx265 -map 0:v:0 -map 0:v:1 output.mkv\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated does not accomplish what the user requested because the proposed ffmpeg command would not work as intended. Specifically, the command tries to use both H.264 and H.265 codecs simultaneously in a way that is not supported by `ffmpeg`.\n\n2) The output is somewhat similar to the failure example but does not quite match it. The example command in the failure example uses an incorrect preset that does not exist, while the model's output generates a command that is syntactically correct but logically incorrect in achieving the goal of encoding with both codecs simultaneously in the same output.\n\n3) The command provided by the model does not break any specific syntax rules as per the ffmpeg man page; however, it misunderstands the requirement of generating two streams with different codecs in a single output file. The command is incorrect in its assumption that one can map two different codec encodings to two video streams simultaneously without defining which input video stream each of them is from or correctly structuring the output.\n\nFinally, to summarize: \n- The model's output does contain the described issue because it provides an incorrect command that will not achieve the user's request for simultaneous encoding in one output file. \n\nGiven all of the above evaluations and points, the model's output fails in fulfilling the user's request effectively."
