  "output": "To extract a specific video track and audio stream from your input file, you'll use FFmpeg's stream mapping feature with the `-map` parameter to select exactly which streams you want in the output.\n\n- `-map 0:0` selects the first video stream from the input file\n- `-map 0:5` selects the sixth audio stream from the input file  \n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` copy the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.mov -map 0:0 -map 0:6 -c:v copy -c:a copy simple.mp4\n```\n\nThis assumes your input file has at least 6 audio streams (indexed 0-5) and uses stream copying to avoid quality loss and speed up the process.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains an issue. The command generated specifies `-map 0:6` to select the sixth audio stream, but the correct command should use `-map 0:5`. The mapping indices in FFmpeg are zero-based, which means the sixth audio stream corresponds to `0:5` and not `0:6`.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command does not contain an invalid parameter (like an unavailable preset) but has a numerical mistake in the mapping; however, this mistake still affects the command's correctness.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page, aside from the incorrect mapping index.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does contain the issue described in the task; thus it failed the evaluation as it does not correctly fulfill the user's request due to a mapping error."
