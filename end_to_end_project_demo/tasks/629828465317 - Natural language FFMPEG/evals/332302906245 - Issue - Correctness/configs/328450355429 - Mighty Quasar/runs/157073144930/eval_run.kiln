  "output": "To convert an FLV file to MP4 using the x264 codec with AAC audio at 320 kbps, you'll want to encode the video with libx264 and set the audio bitrate explicitly. Assuming you want to keep the original quality as much as possible, you can specify a CRF value; otherwise, for a set bitrate, you can use -b:a 320k.\n\n- -c:v libx264 encodes the video with H.264.\n- -c:a aac sets the AAC audio codec.\n- -b:a 320k sets the audio bitrate to 320 kbps.\n- Ensuring compatibility and proper MP4 formatting, optionally including -movflags +faststart for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.flv -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 320k -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command is correctly formatted and properly addresses the user's request to convert an FLV file to MP4 using the specified codecs and settings.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated by the model is valid and does not contain an error like the non-existent preset `extra_fast` in the failure example.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly utilizes options such as `-c:v libx264` for video encoding and `-c:a aac` for audio encoding, as well as correctly setting the audio bitrate with `-b:a 320k`. Furthermore, including `-movflags +faststart` is appropriate for ensuring better compatibility for streaming, particularly with MP4 files.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described and accurately fulfills the user's request, so it should pass the evaluation."
