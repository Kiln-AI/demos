  "input": "My file `multitrack.mov` has an alpha channel for transparency. Please convert it to a WebM with VP9, preserving the transparency.",
  "output": "To convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM format with VP9 while preserving transparency, you should encode both the video with VP9 and the transparency with an appropriate alpha channel codec. WebM VP9 supports alpha transparency using the `-pix_fmt yuva420p` pixel format and the `-c:v libvpx-vp9` encoder with the `-auto-alt-ref 0` option to preserve alpha. \n\nAssuming your MOV file indeed has an alpha channel (RGBA), here is how you can do it:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multitrack.mov -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pix_fmt yuva420p -auto-alt-ref 0 output.webm\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Reads the MOV file with `-i multitrack.mov`.\n- Uses `libvpx-vp9` for VP9 encoding (`-c:v libvpx-vp9`).\n- Sets pixel format to `yuva420p` to include alpha transparency.\n- Disables auto alternate reference frames (`-auto-alt-ref 0`) to ensure alpha is preserved.\n\nAssumption: The MOV file contains an alpha channel for transparency.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated command corresponds correctly to the requirements specified by the user, which was to convert a MOV file with an alpha channel to a WebM format while preserving the transparency. \n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated is valid for the task at hand and does not include any parameters that are known to be incorrect or invalid according to the FFmpeg documentation.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. The syntax used is correct, and the options employed (like `-c:v libvpx-vp9`, `-pix_fmt yuva420p`, and `-auto-alt-ref 0`) are valid for encoding a video with VP9 codec while preserving transparency.\n\n4) Considering the above points, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command matches the user's requirements accurately and adheres to the specification set by FFmpeg. Therefore, the evaluation outcome is a \"pass\" since the outputs are correct and correspond well to the user's request."
