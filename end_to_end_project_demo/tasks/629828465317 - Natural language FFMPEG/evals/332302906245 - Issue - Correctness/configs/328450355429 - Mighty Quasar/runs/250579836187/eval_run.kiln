  "input": "I need to apply temporal noise reduction, spatial denoising, and edge enhancement filters in a specific order. What's the correct filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply temporal noise reduction (tn), spatial denoising (denoise), and edge enhancement (unsharp) in the specified order, use the `-filter_complex` option with a filter chain. The order of filters in the chain determines their application sequence. Note that the `denoise` filter requires the `vfx` library (part of FFMPEG), so ensure it is enabled during FFMPEG compilation if not already available.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"tn, denoise, unsharp\" output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `tn`: Temporal noise reduction filter (reduces noise across frames).\n- `denoise`: Spatial denoising filter (cleanups noise within individual frames).\n- `unsharp`: Edge enhancement filter (sharpens edges and details).\n- Filters are applied in the order listed (`tn` → `denoise` → `unsharp`).\n- Default parameters are used for each filter unless specified otherwise. Adjust parameters (e.g., `tn=strength=2.0`, `denoise=strength=3.0`, `unsharp=luma_a=1.0:luma_b=1.0`) for finer control if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**  \nYes, the model's output contains an issue. The command provided (`ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex \"tn, denoise, unsharp\" output.mp4`) is incorrect because the filters `tn` and `denoise` are not recognized as valid filter names in FFmpeg. The correct designation for temporal noise reduction is `temporal_denoise`, and the spatial denoising filter will also need to be properly identified (e.g., using the `dnl` filter or similar). This command would likely fail to execute successfully.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nYes, the model's output is similar because it contains filters that do not exist in the FFmpeg command-line tool, similar to the given example of using a non-existent preset.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nYes, the command provided is invalid as it uses non-existent filters (`tn` and `denoise`). The man page for FFmpeg specifies that valid filter names must be used and does not recognize the filters mentioned. Thus, the command would not conform to the requirements laid out in the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nYes, the model's output contains the issue described, and it would fail to execute properly due to the use of incorrect filter names."
