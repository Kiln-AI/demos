  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "To perform a quality-based two-pass VP9 encoding from MP4 to AVI, you’ll need to create two commands:\n\n1. First pass: Analyze video for optimal encoding settings.\n2. Second pass: Encode video using determined settings for higher quality.\n\nAVI files do not officially support VP9, but the AVI container is sometimes used with certain libx265 compatible libs. Since libx265 with VP9 isn’t available in standard FFmpeg as of my last update, instead, I’ll demonstrate how to use `libvpx-vp9` (VP9 via libvpx) in WebM container (best container for VP9).\n\nIf you really want to use AVI container with VP9, you might have to use experimental build or remux, but the recommended method for VP9 is WebM.\n\nFor best practice, I’ll demonstrate two-pass VP9 encoding into a .webm container:\n\n**Pass 1:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -cpu-used 4 -pass 1 -row-mt 1 -end-frames 0 -an -f webm /dev/null\n```\n\n**Pass 2:**\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -cpu-used 4 -pass 2 -row-mt 1 -end-frames 0 -an output.webm\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9` encodes with VP9 codec.\n- `-b:v 0` auto-calculates bitrate (automatically optimizes).\n- `-cpu-used 4` balances encoding speed and quality.\n- `-pass 1` collects statistics for second pass.\n- `-pass 2` encodes main pass.\n- `-row-mt 1` enables multi-threading for encoding.\n- `-an` disables audio (VP9 has no native AVI audio compatibility).\n- Use `/dev/null` in pass 1 output to suppress output.\n\n**Alternative if want to stick with AVI container:**\n- Use the experimental VP9 encoder in ffmpeg (be aware quality may be lower with AVI):\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a none -an -b:v 0 -cpu-used 4 -row-mt 1 -f avi output.avi\n```\n\nBut again, best practice is to use WebM for VP9.\n\n---\n\n> **Summary**:\n\nTwo-pass libvpx-vp9 encoding into WebM:\n\n```bash\n# First pass:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -cpu-used 4 -pass 1 -row-mt 1 -end-frames 0 -an -f webm /dev/null\n\n# Second pass:\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -cpu-used 4 -pass 2 -row-mt 1 -end-frames 0 -an output.webm\n```\n\nThis will yield the highest quality VP9 output. VP9 does not support AVI containers, so WebM is recommended.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the model's output contains an issue by initially stating how to transcode to AVI using the VP9 codec, which is not officially supported by the AVI format. The explanation correctly mentions that instead of AVI, the recommended container for VP9 is WebM, and provides commands for that format. However, the user specifically requested AVI, and the model fails to provide a valid method to fulfill that request without explicitly stating the limitations and potential failures of using VP9 with an AVI container. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n   - The model's output is different from the provided failure example. The commands generated are syntactically correct and contain valid options, even though they are not suitable for the requested AVI container.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The commands generated are in line with ffmpeg syntax and do not break any explicit rules outlined in the man page. They correctly follow the expected order and usage of options. However, the core problem remains that VP9 transcoding to AVI is not a conventional or officially supported process, which the model did not effectively communicate to the user in the context of their request.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The output does contain the issue as it does not appropriately fulfill the user’s request for transcoding to AVI with VP9, and instead provides an alternative that is a well-informed workaround rather than a direct solution. Hence, it should fail based on the evaluation criteria set out in the issue description."
