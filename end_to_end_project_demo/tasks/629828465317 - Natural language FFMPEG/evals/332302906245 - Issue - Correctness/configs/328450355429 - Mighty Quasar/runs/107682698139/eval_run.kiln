  "output": "To extract and include the **second video stream** and **fourth audio stream** from `complex.avi`, we use the `-map` option in FFmpeg. This option allows explicit mapping of streams from the input file to the output.\n\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index 1, since indexing starts at 0).\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3 for audio).\n- We must re-encode the streams in the output format, as MP4 typically uses H.264 for video and AAC for audio. By default, FFmpeg will re-encode transcoded streams unless you use `copy`, but for browser compatibility and to allow container synchronization, re-encoding using standard settings is recommended.\n- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac` specify the codecs for encoding.\n- `output.mp4` is the resulting file name.\n\nAssuming you're targeting browser compatibility and MP4 output, here's the appropriate command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset fast -crf 23 -b:a 192k output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Issue Description Evaluation:** The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model appears to be correct and aligned with the user's request to map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from the specified file (`complex.avi`). The usage of the `-map` option correctly identifies the desired streams and there are no obvious mistakes in syntax or structure that would prevent it from functioning as intended.\n\n2) **Similar to Failing Output Example Evaluation:** The generated command does not resemble the failing output example provided. The command is constructed properly and specifies valid options; it uses `-map` correctly and chooses appropriate codecs for output, which is not indicative of a failure like using a non-existent preset. \n\n3) **Man Page Compliance Evaluation:** The command generated by the model adheres to the requirements set forth in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly specifies the input file, maps the desired streams with `-map`, specifies the codecs for encoding the output, and includes an output file name. The order of options follows the guidelines, and everything is valid according to the options listed in the man page.\n\n4) **Final Outcome Evaluation:** Overall, the model's output successfully fulfills the user's request without errors and adheres to the documented requirements. Therefore, it should be considered to have **passed** the evaluation."
