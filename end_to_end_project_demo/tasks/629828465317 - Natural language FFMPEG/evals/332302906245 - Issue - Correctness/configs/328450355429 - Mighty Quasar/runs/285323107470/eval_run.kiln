  "input": "Combine `part1.mp4`, `part2.mp4`, and `part3.mp4` into a single file called `full_movie.mp4`. Make sure there are no re-encoding artifacts.",
  "output": "To combine multiple MP4 files without re-encoding (i.e., losslessly), all source files need to have the exact same codec, resolution, framerate, and audio parameters. For MP4 files, the safest lossless method is to use the ffmpeg concat demuxer with a text file that lists the files to join.\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\n1. Create a text file (let's call it `files.txt`) with the following contents:\n\n```\nfile 'part1.mp4'\nfile 'part2.mp4'\nfile 'part3.mp4'\n```\n\n2. Use ffmpeg with the concat demuxer and the -c copy option to avoid re-encoding:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i files.txt -c copy full_movie.mp4\n```\n\n- -f concat tells ffmpeg to use the concat demuxer.\n- -safe 0 is often required if your file paths are absolute or outside the current directory.\n- -c copy ensures streams are copied directly, avoiding re-encoding and artifacts.\n\nAssumption: All input MP4s were encoded the same way (same codecs, framerates, and parameters). If they aren’t, you’ll need to re-encode them to match first.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated is correct for combining multiple MP4 files without re-encoding, and it follows the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command is valid and does not contain any incorrect options like the nonexistent preset `extra_fast`.\n\n3) The command in the output adheres to the requirements stated in the man page for ffmpeg. It uses proper syntax for the concat demuxer and the `-c copy` option, which is appropriate for lossless concatenation of media files.\n\n4) Given everything above, the output does not have any issues and should pass the evaluation. The model has successfully provided a correct and valid ffmpeg command based on the user's request."
