  "input": "Convert this MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec for web streaming",
  "output": "To convert an MKV file to MP4 using the libvpx codec, note that libvpx is typically used with WebM containers. MP4 containers don't usually support VP8/VP9 video codecs directly. \n\nAssuming you want to produce a WebM file with VP8 (libvpx), you should use the WebM container instead of MP4. Alternatively, if you must create an MP4, consider using a supported codec like H.264.\n\nIf you want to proceed with WebM (which is common for VP8/VP9 video), here’s how:\n\n- `-c:v libvpx` specifies VP8 encoding.\n- `-b:v` sets the video bitrate suitable for streaming.\n- `-c:a libopus` or `-c:a libvorbis` for audio encoding in WebM.\n\nAssuming your goal is a WebM for web streaming:\n\n- Replace `output.mp4` with `output.webm`.\n- Keep in mind, MP4 containers generally don't support VP8/VP9 codecs.\n\nHere’s the command for WebM with VP8:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx -b:v 2M -c:a libopus output.webm\n```\n\n**Note:** If you strictly need MP4, you should use H.264. Let me know if you'd like that command instead!",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The command produced by the model is designed for creating a WebM file rather than an MP4 file as per the user's request. While the model correctly identifies the limitations of using the `libvpx` codec with an MP4 format, it does not provide a valid `ffmpeg` command that fulfills the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output does not strongly resemble the example of a failing output: `ffmpeg -I input.avi -preset extra_fast output.mp4` as it doesn't contain any obviously incorrect command syntax or parameters. However, it does lead to a situation where the user may be confused about the proper container for the requested codec. The provided command for WebM is correct in syntax but doesn't match the user's request, which can still be considered a failure in meeting the requirements.\n\n3) The command breaks the requirement dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg` since the user specifically requested an MP4 file and not a WebM file. While the model does correctly point out the usual association of the `libvpx` codec with WebM files, it fails to provide a valid command that successfully creates an MP4 file, thus not adhering to user instructions.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the output does contain the issue described. Therefore, it fails to meet the user's request appropriately, and the performance of the model on this task should be considered unsuccessful."
