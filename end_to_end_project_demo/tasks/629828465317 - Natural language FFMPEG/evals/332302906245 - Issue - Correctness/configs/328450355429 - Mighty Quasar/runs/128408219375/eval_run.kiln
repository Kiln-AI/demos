  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to extract the 7th video stream and the 14th audio stream from input.mov and create a single output file. Let me think about how to do this with ffmpeg.\n\nFirst, in ffmpeg, stream selection is done using the -map option. Each stream is identified with an index. Video streams start with 0:v, 1:v, etc. So the 7th video stream would be -map 0:6 because indexing starts at 0. Similarly, the 14th audio stream is -map 0:13, since the first audio is 0, then 1, up to 13 for the 14th.\n\nThen, I need to specify which codec to use for encoding. The user didn't specify a codec, so maybe just use the default copy for both? But copying might not always work, especially if the codecs aren't supported in the output container. Alternatively, the user might want re-encoding. But since they didn't mention quality or specific codecs, probably safest to copy streams to avoid re-encoding, preserving original quality.\n\nSo the command would map the two streams and copy them. The output container could be to .mkv for wide codec support, or maybe .mp4. The user didn't specify the output format, but maybe they just want a common format. If using .mp4, make sure the codecs are compatible. But for simplicity, using .mkv would be safe. Or perhaps the user wants a flexible output and just specify the file as output.mp4.\n\nWait, but sometimes in .mp4, some codecs (like h.264 audio) aren't supported. So perhaps better to use .mkv. Or maybe the user's audio stream is AAC or other. Since they didn't specify, safest to use .mkv as container.\n\nSo the command would be:\n\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mkv\n\nThat maps the 7th video and 14th audio streams (indexes 6 and 13), copies the codecs, and puts them into an MKV container.\n\nBut maybe the user wants to re-encode for compatibility? But the question says \"create a single output\" without specific requirements, so assuming copy is acceptable. Also, it's possible that the original codec of the 14th audio stream isn't compatible with the output container. So maybe the user should be warned. But the problem is the user just asks to map those two streams. So the answer is to use -map with the correct indexes and -c copy.\n\nAlternatively, if the user's output format requires specific codecs, they might need encoding. But without that info, the default is to copy. So I'll proceed with that.\n</think>\n\nTo selectively extract the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from input.mov, use the `-map` option to specify their indices. Media streams are 0-indexed, so stream 0:0 is the first video, 0:1 first audio, etc. Use `-map 0:v:6` for the 7th video stream (index 6) and `-map 0:a:13` for the 14th audio stream (index 13). Using `-c copy` avoids re-encoding for maximum speed and quality preservation, but the output container must allow all codecs used in the mapped streams. MKV is a good safe choice for general compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nKey parameters:\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (index 6)\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream (index 13)\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding\n- `.mkv` output container for wide codec compatibility\n- No re-encoding means input codecs must be supported by the output container\n\nIf your input streams use codecs incompatible with MKV/MP4 limitations, you'll need to use codec remapping like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac` to re-encode to H.264/MP3.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is a valid ffmpeg command that follows the user's request to map the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file. It uses the correct syntax and parameters for invoking ffmpeg and should work appropriately without errors.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command provided by the model (`ffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mkv`) is correct and valid, while the failure example features an incorrect option, which does not apply here.\n\n3) The command generated does not break any requirements as dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It adheres to the proper use of the `-map` option, and the `-c copy` parameter is used correctly to copy the selected streams without re-encoding. The output format (MKV) is appropriate given the goal to combine the selected video and audio streams. The command complies with the general rules and requirements outlined in the man page.\n\n4) Considering the above, the model's output does not contain the issue described, as it successfully generates a command that is valid, matches the user's request, and is compliant with the ffmpeg documentation. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
