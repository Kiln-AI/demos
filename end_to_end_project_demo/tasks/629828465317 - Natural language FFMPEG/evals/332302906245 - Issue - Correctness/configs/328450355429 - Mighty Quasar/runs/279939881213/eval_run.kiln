  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file using ffmpeg, you can use the `-map` option to explicitly choose the desired video and audio streams by their stream indices.\n\n- `-map 0:v:12` selects the 13th video stream from the first input (index 0).\n- `-map 0:a:25` selects the 26th audio stream from the first input.\n- This keeps only those streams in the output.\n- Additionally, you should specify the codecs you want for video and audio (or copy to preserve streams without re-encoding).\n\nAssuming you want to copy the streams without re-encoding, the command would be:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c copy output_selected_streams.mkv\n```\n\nThis outputs a Matroska container with only your specified video and audio streams preserved as-is. Adjust the output container if you require a different format.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The FFmpeg command generated is appropriate for the task of selecting specific video and audio streams from a multi-stream file. The output adheres to the requirements given by the user and makes proper use of the `-map` option, which is the correct approach for selecting specific streams.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The FFmpeg command it generated is logically sound and does not contain any incorrect parameters or options, unlike the failing example which incorrectly included a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command produced by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. It correctly implements the `-map` option to specify which streams to select and uses `-c copy` to preserve the selected streams without re-encoding them. There are no conflicts with the standard options as specified in the documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command is accurate and fits the user's request for selecting specific video and audio streams from the input file. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
