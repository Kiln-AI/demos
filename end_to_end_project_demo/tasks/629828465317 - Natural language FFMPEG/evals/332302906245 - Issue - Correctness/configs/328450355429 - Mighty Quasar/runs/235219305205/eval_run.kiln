    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The output does not present any coherent or complete ffmpeg command; instead, it appears to be a string of incoherent characters and words that does not form a valid command as expected by the user. This output fails to meet the user's request for mapping specific streams and creating a single output.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example. Instead of producing a valid ffmpeg command, it presents gibberish that has no relevant content, much like the failure example which also produces an invalid command.\n\n3) Regarding potential requirements from the ffmpeg man page, the output does not break any requirements because it does not form a command at all, hence it does not adhere to or conflict with any of the documented options or syntax.\n\n4) Based on the evaluation, the model's output fails to produce a correct and coherent ffmpeg command, as it lacks any pertinent structure or validity needed to fulfill the user's request for mapping streams. Thus, the evaluation outcome should register a failure."
