  "input": "I have a vertical video `story.mov`. Please add blurred bars to the left and right to make it a 16:9 widescreen video.",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo convert your vertical video into a 16:9 widescreen format with blurred bars on the left and right, we can use FFmpeg's filterchain. The process involves:\n\n1. **Using the `scale` filter** to fit the video to the 16:9 aspect ratio by resizing while maintaining the original aspect ratio. However, the video will have black bars to fill the 16:9 frame if padding is not specified.\n2. **Using the `pad` filter** to explicitly add black bars to the sides to make the output 16:9.\n3. **Using the `boxblur` filter** to apply a blur effect to the bars.\n   - There is no direct ffmpeg method to blur only the bars. However, you can subtract the unblurred video from the blurred full-size frame, creating the illusion that only the bars are blurred.\n4. Then, use `overlay` and combine it into a single video.\n\nHowever, **a better approach** is to pad the video to 16:9 with the required height, then split the cropped video from the padded frame and blur the outside area (left and right bars) to get the desired effect. Since we cannot directly blur the bars without blurring the entire image, a workaround is to create a blurred black bar and overlay the original video over that. \n\nFor practicality and simplicity, here’s a standard approach that **blurs only the added black bars on the sides**:\n\nWe’ll:\n\n1. **Pad to a 16:9 ratio with black bars.**\n2. **Create a copy of the padded frame, apply a blur filter to it, and overlay the original video.**\n3. **Output the result**.\n\nAssuming the original video is 1080px wide and 1920px high (iPhone portrait aspect, common vertical video size), to get 16:9, the target resolution is 1920x1080. But if the source is mobile and 9:16 with various resolutions, you can use variables.\n\nBelow is a concise and manageable implementation:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n -filter_complex \\\n \"[0:v]pad=iw:iw*9/16:0:0:black[0]; \\\n  [0]scale=1920:1080,boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[1]; \\\n  [1][0]overlay=shortest=1\" \\\n -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `pad=iw:iw*9/16:0:0:black[0];`: creates a 16:9 padded frame with black bars on both sides, maintaining original width.\n- `scale=1920:1080` is a target example; for general-purpose, use:\n  - `pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih*16/9/2)*2:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:black` to dynamically pad to 16:9 with black bars.\n  - However, simplifying with 1920:1080 is fine for a specific example.\n- `boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1` adds a strong blur to the black bars.\n- `overlay=shortest=1` overlays the original video (unblurred) over the blurred black bars.\n\n---\n\n**A comprehensive and more general version with dynamic padding and blur just on the black bars:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n -vf \"pad='ceil((iw*16/9)/2)*2':ceil((ih*16/9/2)/2)*2:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2:black,v = overlay = i=1:iw:ih:white,duplicate[bg][0]; [bg]boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[blurred]; [0][blurred]overlay=shortest=1\" \\\n -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nThis is advanced and may require debugging for some videos.\n\n---\n\n**A readable and safer option for beginners is this:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n -filter_complex \\\n \"[0:v]pad=iw:iw*9/16:0:0:black[0]; \\\n  [0]boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[1]; \\\n  [0][1]overlay=shortest=1\" \\\n -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\nThis will:\n\n1. Pad video to 16:9 with black bars.\n2. Create a blurred copy of the padded frame.\n3. Overlay the original video (unblurred version) over that blurred frame, so only the bars are blurred.\n\n---\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n -filter_complex \\\n \"[0:v]pad=iw:iw*9/16:0:0:black,boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[bg]; \\\n  [0:v]setpts=PTS+0/TB[main]; \\\n  [main][bg]overlay=0:0[output]\" \\\n -map \"[output]\" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\nThis approach focuses on blurring only the added bars in the padded frame — ideal for a vertical video.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBlurring just the sides of a video is not directly supported by a single filter, so the approach is:\n\n1. Create a black-padded 16:9 video.\n2. Blur the padded area.\n3. Overlay the original (unblurred) video over the blurred background to show only the unblurred video on top, with blurred bars around it.\n\nTry the following as a simple, readable command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov -vf \"pad='iw':ceil(iw/9*16/2)*2:0:0:black\" -filter_complex \\\n  \"[0]scale=iw:ih,boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[bg]; [0:0][bg]overlay=0:0\" \\\n  -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\n---\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n- Input video is vertical.\n- You want 16:9 output.\n- You want only the side bars to be blurred.\n- Input aspect ratio is arbitrary (not 9:16 1920:1080 video). If the input is 9:16, then 1920:1080 is your target size for 16:9.\n\n**Final recommendation for most purposes:**\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i story.mov \\\n -filter_complex \\\n \"[0:v]pad='iw':ceil(iw/9*16/2)*2:0:0:black[0]; \\\n  [0]scale=iw:ih,boxblur=luma_radius=30:luma_power=1[1]; \\\n  [0][1]overlay=0:0\" \\\n -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_blurred_bars.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n\n- Pads the video to 16:9 with black bars.\n- Scales and blurs the padded frame (blurs the black bars).\n- Overlays the unblurred original video over it so that only the side bars are blurred.\n\n--- \n\nLet me know if your source video has a predefined size — I can tailor the command even more!",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated is complex with a prolonged explanation, but there are several flaws in the command. For example, it suggests using both `pad` and `overlay` without detailing or structuring it according to proper FFmpeg syntax conventions. Additionally, there are references to filters that may not function as expected in tandem, reflecting potential misunderstandings of how to implement the desired effect of blurring only the sides.\n\n2) The model's output is not strikingly similar to the failure example, as it provides a proper command structure albeit convoluted. The command is syntactically correct, but there are inconsistencies and assumptions made that could lead to failure. The specific example does not contain commands leading to syntax errors like \"preset extra_fast\", but rather suggests complex filter combinations that could lead to unexpected results when run in practice.\n\n3) The command breaks some recommended practices dictated in the man page, particularly in the complexity of the filter complex and assumptions about dynamic padding and scaling. For instance, the command fails to maintain clarity and could cause confusion regarding the use of `scale`, `pad`, and their respective parameters and placements without ensuring they operate correctly in the intended sequence. The correct application of overlaying two separate frames that might not be managed as per the FFmpeg standards is also overlooked. These issues imply a misunderstanding of how to manipulate video streams while adhering to the necessary command line protocols.\n\nThe model ultimately misses the user's straightforward request by overcomplicating the solution and failing to validate whether the end command actually achieves the required task effectively and directly. As such, the performance of the model regarding this output does not pass."
