  "input": "I want to apply color correction and noise reduction in a filter chain. Please use -vf 'eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5' to adjust colors and reduce noise.",
  "output": "To apply both color correction and noise reduction using a filter chain in ffmpeg, you can use the -vf option with multiple filters separated by commas. In your example, eq adjusts brightness and contrast for color correction, while hqdn3d performs spatial and temporal noise reduction.\n\n- eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2 increases brightness by 0.1 and sets contrast to 1.2×.\n- hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5 applies strong denoising: the first two numbers are luma and chroma spatial thresholds, last two are luma and chroma temporal thresholds.\n\nAssuming you want to process input.mp4 and save as output.mp4, here’s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.2,hqdn3d=4:3:6:4.5\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- Applies brightness and contrast adjustments, then reduces noise.\n- Copies audio stream unchanged (-c:a copy).\n- Adjust filter parameters as needed for your source and desired strength.\n\nTip: Always test with different denoising levels to avoid loss of detail.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated ffmpeg command appears to correctly reflect the user's request for applying color correction and noise reduction using the specified filters.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced does not contain any clearly invalid options or parameters (like a non-existent preset). The filters used (eq and hqdn3d) are valid and are properly formatted within the command.\n\n3) The output command adheres to the requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The syntax used for specifying filters with the `-vf` option and the option `-c:a copy` to copy the audio stream are both correct. The command is structured properly with respect to input and output files, making it compliant with the general rules laid out in the man page.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any mistakes or violations of the ffmpeg command rules (and adheres to the user's request), it passes the evaluation."
