  "input": "I want to convert my video.avi to MOV format using the nvenc_h265 encoder with ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To convert video.avi to a MOV file using the NVIDIA hardware-accelerated H.265 encoder (nvenc_h265) with an ultrafast preset, you specify the video codec as `hevc_nvenc` and set `-preset ultrafast` for fastest encoding speed (but lower compression efficiency). The MOV container is used by setting the output file extension to .mov.\n\nAssuming your system supports nvenc_h265 and you want to keep the original audio codec without re-encoding audio.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v hevc_nvenc -preset ultrafast -c:a copy output.mov\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generated adheres to the specifications for converting the format and using the specified encoder and preset, fulfilling the user's request effectively.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output. The command constructed is valid and uses a recognized encoder and preset. The nonexistent preset \"extra_fast\" in the failure example is not present here; instead, the output correctly uses \"ultrafast,\" which is a valid preset.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The sequence and use of parameters are appropriate, with arguments like `-i`, `-c:v`, `-preset`, and `-c:a` following the proper format. The output file is correctly named with a .mov extension, which indicates the use of the MOV format as requested.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluations, the model's output does not contain the issues described. It generates a correct command based on the user's input, adhering to the requirements of ffmpeg. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
