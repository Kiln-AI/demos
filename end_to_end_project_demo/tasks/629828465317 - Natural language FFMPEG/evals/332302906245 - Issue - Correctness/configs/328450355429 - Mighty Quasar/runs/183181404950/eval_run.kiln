  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map specific streams from the input file, use the `-map` option. `-map 0:3` selects the video from the fourth stream (index 3) of the first input (index 0). `-map 0:5` selects the audio from the sixth stream (index 5) from the first input. I'm using default codecs for video (libx264) and audio (aac) which are generally suitable for .mp4. I'm also adding `-movflags +faststart` to optimize the output for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```\n",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The command it generated correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file `source.mkv` and outputs them to `edited.mp4` with appropriate codecs. The command adheres to the user's requirements without any errors or omissions.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the failing output example. The command generated is valid and uses recognized options and codecs in the `ffmpeg` command line. The failing example suggested an invalid preset, whereas the model's command utilizes valid and common codecs.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` for selecting streams is correct, and the codecs specified (`libx264` for video and `aac` for audio) are appropriate for an MP4 output file. The syntax of the command is also consistent with the FFmpeg command-line interface as described in the documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates a correct `ffmpeg` command that meets the user's requirements."
