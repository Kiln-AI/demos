  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file with maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract the audio track from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with maximum compression, we'll extract only the audio stream (-map 0:a selects all audio streams), use the FLAC codec (-c:a flac), and apply the \"compression_level\" parameter set to 8 (maximum compression for FLAC). This preserves the original quality (lossless) while achieving the best file size reduction FLAC can provide.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -map 0:a -c:a flac -compression_level 8 audio.flac\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does contain an issue described in the issue description. Specifically, the parameter `-compression_level` is not a valid option in FFmpeg for setting FLAC compression. Instead, the correct option to specify the compression level for FLAC should be `-compression_level` without any specific value. This misstep means that the command generated may not execute correctly.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the provided failure example. The output in question is structured correctly with regard to input and output files, and it does not contain an invalid preset like `-preset extra_fast`. However, it does contain an incorrect parameter for compression, which could lead to a failure in execution.\n\n3) The command does not break any fundamental requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page in terms of format and parameter structuring. However, the use of `-compression_level` is incorrect, as this option is used but misapplied. The proper method to set FLAC compression would typically use the option `-compression_level` followed by a value (from 0 to 8), with the default being 5. The model's output mistakenly implies that `-compression_level` is valid as presented.\n\n4) Based on this evaluation, the modelâ€™s output does contain an issue, and thus it fails to meet the requirement. The command may not work correctly because of the misused parameter, which does not exist in FFmpeg."
