  "input": "Extract the second video stream (stream 0:1) and fourth audio track (stream 0:3) from my multi-stream file input.avi and save as result.mp4",
  "output": "To extract and remux specific streams from a media file, use the `-map` option to select desired streams. \n\nHere, stream 0:1 is the second video stream and stream 0:3 is the fourth audio stream. The output will use the H.264 codec by default, remuxing streams directly to an MP4 container without re-encoding, via `-c copy`. If re-encoding is needed, re-specify codecs explicitly.\n\nThis command assumes your streams are video and audio, and that your file contains multiple video and audio streams. If not, the video/audio extraction might not be aligned correctly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy result.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain any issues regarding the command it generates; the command correctly implements the user requirement to extract specific streams from the input file `input.avi`. The use of the `-map` option to select the desired video and audio streams and the `-c copy` option signifies that it is remuxing the streams without re-encoding, which is appropriate for the intended output format (MP4).\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failing output example. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i input.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy result.mp4`) is syntactically correct and uses valid parameters. It conforms to expected use cases for stream extraction in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command generated by the model adheres to the FFmpeg man page requirements and syntax. The usage of `-map` to specify the second video stream (`0:v:1`) and the fourth audio stream (`0:a:3`) is correct. The `-c copy` option is appropriate for remuxing the streams without altering their codec format.\n\n4) Given this analysis, the model's output should pass as it successfully generates a working command that meets user requirements without any issues present in its formulation."
