  "output": "You want to convert an OGG audio file to WAV, using the Vorbis decoder and setting the sample rate to 48kHz. This involves decoding the OGG, then re-encoding it as WAV with the specified parameters.\n\n- `vorbis`: Specifies the Vorbis decoder for decoding the input OGG file.\n- `pcm_s16le`: Specifies the PCM signed 16-bit little-endian audio format, which is the standard WAV format.\n- `-ar 48000`: Sets the audio sample rate to 48kHz.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.ogg -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 48000 output.wav\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command generated should work correctly for the task of converting an OGG audio file to WAV format. It uses the appropriate audio codec and sample rate as specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the <failure_example>. The command does not contain any non-existent parameters or incorrect usage; it correctly specifies the PCM codec for output and the sample rate. \n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used (such as `-i` for input file, `-acodec` for the audio codec, and `-ar` for setting the sample rate) are valid and appropriate for the task.\n\nIn conclusion, the model's output is accurate, correctly formatted, and meets the userâ€™s requirements effectively. Therefore, it passes evaluation."
