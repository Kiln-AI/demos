  "input": "I want to rotate my video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction with the strongest filters available.",
  "output": "To rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and apply advanced noise reduction using ffmpeg, you can use the `transpose` filter to rotate the video and the `lanczos4` denoiser filter for noise reduction.\n\n- The `transpose` filter with the parameter `cclock` (or `cc` short for clockwise) will rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise.\n- The `lanczos4` filter is a very strong denoiser that uses a fast, yet effective algorithm to reduce noise.\n\nAssuming you have a video file named `input.mp4`, hereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=cclock,lanczos4\" -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf \"transpose=cclock,lanczos4\"` applies both the rotation and denoising in the video filter (`-vf`) chain.\n- `transpose=cclock` rotates the video clockwise by 90 degrees.\n- `lanczos4` applies noise reduction to the video.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p` ensures the output is in a widely supported pixel format.\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step based on the provided criteria.\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   The model's output does not contain any issues as it accurately reflects the user's request for rotating the video 90 degrees clockwise and applying advanced noise reduction. The filters used in the command are valid and appropriate for the operations specified.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   No, the output is not similar to the failing example. The command produced by the model is logically coherent and uses valid ffmpeg parameters, while the failure example involved an invalid preset option that does not exist.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   The command does not break any of the requirements mentioned in the man page. The options utilized, including `-vf \"transpose=cclock,lanczos4\"` and `-pix_fmt yuv420p`, are correctly structured and adhere to the syntax rules for ffmpeg commands as outlined in the man page.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   The model's output does **not** contain the issue described, as it generated a valid ffmpeg command that meets the user's requirements without any logical or syntactical errors.\n\n**Conclusion: The model passes the evaluation for this task, producing an appropriate and functional ffmpeg command.**"
