  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "Certainly! In FFmpeg, you can explicitly select (map) specific streams using the -map option. The streams are zero-indexed, and the general notation is:\n\n- video streams: 0:v:0 is the first video stream, 0:v:1 is the second video stream, etc.\n- audio streams: 0:a:0 is the first audio stream, 0:a:1 is the second audio stream, etc.\n\nSo, for complex.avi:\n\n- The second video stream is 0:v:1\n- The fourth audio stream is 0:a:3\n\nAssuming you want to copy these streams without re-encoding (for efficiency), you can use -c copy. If you need to transcode, replace -c copy with your desired codec options.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.avi\n```\n\nThis command extracts the second video stream and fourth audio stream from complex.avi and writes them unchanged into output.avi. Adjust the output filename/extension and codec parameters as needed for your use case.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - No, the model's output does not contain the issue described. The FFmpeg command generated appears to be correct for mapping the specified video and audio streams as requested by the user. It accurately uses the -map option to select the second video stream and the fourth audio stream.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the model's output is not similar to the failing example provided. The command produced by the model is valid and uses correct FFmpeg syntax, as opposed to the failing output example which contains an incorrect preset option.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. It adheres to the syntax for mapping streams and correctly specifies the input and output files as well as the streams to map.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - It should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue. Based on the evaluation, the model's output should pass as it successfully fulfills the user's request without errors."
