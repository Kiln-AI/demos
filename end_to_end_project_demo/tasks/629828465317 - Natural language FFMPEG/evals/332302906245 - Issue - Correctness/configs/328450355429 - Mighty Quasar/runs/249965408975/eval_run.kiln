  "input": "I need to transcode input.mp4 to AVI using the libvp9 codec with 2-pass encoding",
  "output": "The VP9 codec is actually a **web video** codec developed by Google – typically used in WebM (.webm) rather than AVI.  \nFFmpeg’s AVI muxer will let you store VP9 inside an AVI container, but you should be aware most players that open traditional AVI files expect DivX/Xvid/VC-1/H.264 and may reject a VP9-in-AVI file. (If you instead need a *WebM* container, just replace `-f avi` with `-f webm` in the commands.)\n\nAssumptions made  \n• You want **constant-quality**, so we’ll use CRF mode (value 25 is a good starting point; increase/decrease by ±6 to halve / double the size).  \n• You want the same frame-rate and resolution as the source (no scaling).  \n• The audio should be copied as-is (-c:a copy). Change to `-c:a libopus` if you want Opus, or `-an` for silent.\n\nTwo-pass encode to AVI, VP9 (video bitrate ≈ 1 000 k):\n\n```bash\n# First pass (y4m input, null output – gathers stats)\nffmpeg -y -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pass 1 \\\n    -b:v 1000k -crf 25 -speed 4 -threads 8 \\\n    -an -f avi NUL\n\n# Second pass (writes final file)\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libvpx-vp9 -pass 2 \\\n    -b:v 1000k -crf 25 -speed 1 -threads 8 \\\n    -c:a copy output-vp9.avi\n```\n\nIf you instead meant **VP8** (the older libvpx), replace `libvpx-vp9` with `libvpx`.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It returns commands that are correctly structured and do not include any unsupported or incorrect options.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example provided. The commands generated are valid according to FFmpeg's syntax and specifications.\n\n3) The provided command structure adheres to the requirements dictated in the man page. There are no syntax errors; the usage of the `-pass` option for two-pass encoding, `-c:v libvpx-vp9` for setting the video codec, and `-c:a copy` is all consistent with FFmpeg's standards.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described. It successfully generates two valid FFmpeg commands for a two-pass VP9 encoding to AVI, despite the noted potential compatibility issues with some AVI players. Thus, it accurately reflects the user's request without violating any technical requirements. \n\nOverall, the evaluated output passes because it is technically correct, adheres to the FFmpeg guidelines, and does not include any mistakes in command generation."
