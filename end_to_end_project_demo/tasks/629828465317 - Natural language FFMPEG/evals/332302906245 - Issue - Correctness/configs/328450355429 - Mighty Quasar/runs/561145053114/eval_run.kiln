  "input": "I need to compress video.mp4 using the maximum_efficiency preset to save storage space",
  "output": "To compress video.mp4 for maximum storage efficiency with the maximum_efficiency preset (in FFmpeg), use libx264 encoding with the maximum_efficiency preset. This generates highly compressed H.264 video at the cost of speed.\n\n- c:v libx264 sets the video encoder to H.264.\n- -preset maximum_efficiency balances compression efficiency and encoding speed—choose slower presets (like veryfast, fast, etc.) if you're concerned about speed.\n- -crf 28 is a higher quality setting (lower is better—18 is lower quality, 23 is default, 28 is higher quality/bigger files).\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures wide compatibility.\n\nAssumption: The source video is already compatible; compression artifacts can occur, especially with this preset. For smaller files, increase CRF (e.g., 22 or 23).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx264 -preset maximum_efficiency -crf 28 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to keep the original audio, use -c:a copy; otherwise, re-encode audio as well: -c:a aac -b:a 128k.\n\nAdjust the -crf value as needed based on your quality/size preference.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The generated FFmpeg command is valid and appears to fulfill the user's request to compress the video while using the specified `maximum_efficiency` preset.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced is not attempting to use a non-existing preset; rather, it correctly uses the `maximum_efficiency` preset that exists in FFmpeg.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page. All the used options and syntax are well-defined and correctly formatted according to FFmpeg's standards.\n\n4) Given that the command correctly implements the user’s requirements without introduced errors, the model's output passes the evaluation criteria successfully. The command provided generates a valid FFmpeg execution with no apparent issues."
