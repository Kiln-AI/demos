  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To vertically stack two videos, `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, you can use the `scale` and `overlay` video filters in `ffmpeg`. This assumes both videos have the same resolution and frame rate, and you want them aligned without any scaling or cropping.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i top_video.mp4 -i bottom_video.mp4 -filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2[vid1];[1:v]scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2[vid2];[vid1][vid2]vstack=inputs=2\" -c:a copy stacked.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `[0:v]scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2[vid1]`: Scales the top video to the nearest even dimensions to ensure compatibility with some encoders.\n- `[1:v]scale=trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2[vid2]`: Scales the bottom video similarly.\n- `[vid1][vid2]vstack=inputs=2`: Stacks the two videos vertically.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copies the audio stream without re-encoding, assuming both videos have compatible audio. If audio is not compatible, you may need to re-encode it with appropriate settings.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described in the issue description?**\n   - The model's output does not appear to contain any issues. The command it provided correctly represents a valid way to stack two videos vertically using the specified `ffmpeg` filters and techniques. The explanation is also accurate in describing how the parameters work in the context of the command provided. \n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?**\n   - No, the output is not similar to the provided failure example. The command generated by the model uses valid options and does not include any invalid parameters like `preset extra_fast`, which was shown in the failure example.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command adheres to the requirements outlined in the man page. It specifies input files (`top_video.mp4` and `bottom_video.mp4`), applies valid filters (`scale` and `vstack`), and outputs to `stacked.mp4`. The syntax is consistent with the use of options according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - The model's output should pass as it does not contain any issues. It successfully generates a valid and appropriate `ffmpeg` command for the userâ€™s request to stack two videos vertically."
