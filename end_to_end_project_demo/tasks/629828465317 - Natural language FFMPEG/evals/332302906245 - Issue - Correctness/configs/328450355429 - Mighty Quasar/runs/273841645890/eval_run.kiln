  "input": "I want to map the video from stream 0:3 and audio from stream 0:5 of my file source.mkv to create a new file called edited.mp4",
  "output": "To map (select) the video from stream 0:3 (the 4th video stream) and the audio from stream 0:5 (the 6th audio stream) of your source.mkv file and create a new output file edited.mp4, use the -map option in ffmpeg. This will ignore any other streams.\n\n- -map 0:3 explicitly selects the 4th video stream (index 3).\n- -map 0:5 explicitly selects the 6th audio stream (index 5).\n- -c:v libx264 encodes video as H.264 (compatible with MP4).\n- -c:a aac encodes audio as AAC (compatible with MP4).\n- -b:a 128k sets AAC audio bitrate (you can adjust as needed).\n- -movflags +faststart enables MP4 progressive streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i source.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:5 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart edited.mp4\n```\n\nAssumption: You want to encode both video and audio (rather than stream copy). If you want to stream copy instead, use -c copy for both (but MP4 may have codec limitations with stream copy, especially for audio).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to create the output file. It complies with the user's request without any mistakes in the generated ffmpeg command.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failure example. The command produced by the model is likely to work correctly, as the parameters used are valid and properly aligned with the ffmpeg command syntax, unlike the failure example which contains an invalid preset.\n\n3) Based on the man page for ffmpeg, the command generated in the model's output does not break any requirements. The syntax used is correct, and all options are appropriately applied to the specified input and output files.\n\n4) Since the model's output does not contain any issues, it should pass. Therefore, the conclusion is that the model's command is correct and matches the user's requirements."
