  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "To achieve a high-quality output with the specified audio and video bitrates, you can use the following command:\n\n- `-b:a 500k` sets the audio bitrate to 500 kbps (kilobits per second).\n- `-b:v 100G` sets the video bitrate, but note that 100 Gbps (gigabits per second) is extremely high and likely not what you intend, as it would result in an enormous file size. For high-quality video, a more typical bitrate might be in the range of 50-100 Mbps (megabits per second) for 1080p or 4K Resolution. However, I will include the specified value as per your request, but be aware that using such a high bitrate is uncommon and may not be the best choice for standard video encoding.\n\nOther parameters remain similar to those for standard MP4 encoding suitable for browser streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.avi -vf scale=-2:720 -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 500k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -b:v 100G output.mp4\n```\nPlease note, the command provided above uses the video bitrate you specified (100 Gbps), but as mentioned, it's crucial to consider that such a high bitrate might not be practical or necessary for most video encoding purposes.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain the issue described. While the command itself is syntactically correct, the extremely high video bitrate of 100 Gbps is impractical and likely not desired for the use case of encoding video files. This misuse of parameters could cause performance issues or errors when processing, as such an extremely high bitrate may not be supported by typical encoding scenarios.\n\n2) The model's output does not resemble the failure example provided. The command generated by the model does not reference any options or parameters that do not exist in the `ffmpeg` command line tool, such as the `-preset extra_fast` which was mentioned in the failure example. Therefore, it does not fail in the same manner.\n\n3) The command does not appear to break any requirements dictated in the man page for `ffmpeg`. The parameters used (like `-b:v` for setting video bitrate and `-b:a` for setting audio bitrate) are correctly specified, and the order of options according to the input and output files is followed. However, the inclusion of an impractically high video bitrate does fall into a gray area of practical application, but it does not directly violate any requirements.\n\n4) The command fails to accurately meet user expectations due to the impracticality of the chosen bitrate. Thus, while it may follow syntax and structure correctly, it still constitutes a failure in fulfilling the user's request meaningfully. Therefore, it does contain the issue described."
