  "input": "Can you create an ffmpeg command to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from my multi-stream file recording.mkv?",
  "output": "Certainly! In a multimedia container (like MKV) that can support multiple streams, you can specify which streams you want to use by their index. The first video/audio stream is indexed as 0, the second as 1, and so on. In this case, you want to keep the 12th video stream and 25th audio stream. Since you haven't specified any other parameters, I'll keep the default settings for the video and audio codecs.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i recording.mkv -map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-i recording.mkv`: This specifies the input file.\n- `-map 0:v:12 -map 0:a:25`: Maps the 12th video stream (`-v:12`) and the 25th audio stream (`-a:25`) from the input file.\n- `-c:v copy -c:a copy`: Copy the video and audio codecs from the input stream without re-encoding.\n\nThe resulting `output.mp4` file will only contain the 12th video and 25th audio streams from the original `recording.mkv`. If you need to waste no time but leave the assumption for the codecs of the streams not selected, ffmpeg uses the default libx264 for video and AAC for audio, which should be suitable in most cases. Remember to replace 'output.mp4' with the desired output filename if needed.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in <issue_description>. The command it produced correctly addresses the user request to select video stream 12 and audio stream 25 from the multi-stream file recording.mkv and does not include any mistakes that would render the command ineffective.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided in <failure_example>. The command generated is syntactically correct for ffmpeg and does not include options or parameters that are not valid.\n\n3) Based on the ffmpeg man page, the command does not break any requirements. The usage of `-map 0:v:12` and `-map 0:a:25` to select specific video and audio streams is completely valid. The command also correctly uses `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which complies with the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described; therefore, it passes evaluation. The generated command is accurate and fulfills the user's request effectively."
