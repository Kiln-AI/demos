  "input": "Please convert my file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream.",
  "output": "To encode the video with a constant bitrate (CBR) of 25000 kbps, you specify the target bitrate with `-b:v`, set the bitrate control method to CBR using `-maxrate` and `-minrate` (both equal to the target), and keep the encoder’s vbv-bufsize the same as the bitrate to avoid any local variation (a common broadcast-style configuration). I’ll leave the codec, audio, container, etc., at safe defaults.\n\n- `c:v libx264` uses the H.264 encoder.  \n- `b:v 25000k` sets the intended bitrate.  \n- `maxrate 25000k`, `minrate 25000k`, and `bufsize 25000k` together force CBR behavior.  \n- For the audio track we keep whatever exists (stream-copy) with `-c:a copy`; change if you need to re-encode.  \n- Output is written to the same container as input (extension stays `.mp4`). Adjust if the source isn’t MP4.\n\nAssumptions  \nContainer: output will be MP4 (`output.mp4`).  \nAudio: copy existing track (`c:a copy`).  \nCodec: H.264.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -b:v 25000k -maxrate 25000k -minrate 25000k -bufsize 25000k -c:a copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain a critical issue as described in the issue description. The command it generated appears to be valid for setting a constant bitrate (CBR) of 25000k, and all necessary parameters are included for enforcing this bitrate.\n\n2) The output is not similar to the failure example provided. The command makes use of valid ffmpeg parameters, and there are no known parameters being used incorrectly or that do not exist.\n\n3) Referring to the man page, the command generated does not break any requirements dictated there. The use of `-b:v`, `-maxrate`, `-minrate`, and `-bufsize` with the same value aligns with the recommended guidelines for CBR encoding. Each option follows the intended structure and is correctly formatted.\n\n4) Given this analysis, the model's output does not contain the issue described. It correctly generates a valid ffmpeg command that matches the user’s requirements for converting a file with a constant bitrate of 25000k for the video stream. Thus, it should pass."
