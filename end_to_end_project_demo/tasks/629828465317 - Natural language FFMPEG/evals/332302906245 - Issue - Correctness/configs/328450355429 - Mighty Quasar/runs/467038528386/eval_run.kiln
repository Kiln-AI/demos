  "input": "I want to compress video.avi to MP4 using the h264 codec with the ultrafast preset",
  "output": "To compress video.avi to MP4 using the H.264 codec with the ultrafast preset, you can use the following command:\n\n- `-c:v libx264` sets the video codec as H.264.\n- `-preset ultrafast` accelerates encoding at the cost of slightly higher compression ratio.\n- `-crf 23` controls quality (lower is better, 23 is good balanceâ€”lower = smaller file, higher = higher quality).\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding to save processing time and maintain original quality.\n- This ensures the output MP4 is widely compatible for playback.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want to keep the audio stream unchanged for faster output.\n- The input file's codecs and streaming are compatible for MP4 container.\n- File size and compression speed are the primary concerns. If you care strictly about quality, you can swap `-crf 23` with a lower number (e.g., 18).",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command it generates (`ffmpeg -i video.avi -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 23 -c:a copy output.mp4`) is valid and appropriately combines all necessary parameters for the requested transformation, matching the user's requirements.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided failure example. The output does not specify any invalid presets (like `extra_fast`), and the command is well-formed, utilizing valid parameters for `ffmpeg`.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does not break any requirements dictated in the `ffmpeg` man page. It correctly specifies input and output files, utilizes valid options for codec and preset, and combines audio and video options as allowed.\n\n4) Based on the assessment above, the model's output does not contain the issues described, therefore it passes the evaluation."
