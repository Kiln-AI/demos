  "input": "I want to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC with the experimental codec and apply noise reduction",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 as FLAC with experimental codec support and apply noise reduction, we'll use the following approach:\n\n- The `-vn` flag disables video processing (video-no) to extract audio only\n- `-c:a flac` specifies FLAC codec, but since you mentioned the experimental codec, we need `-strict experimental` (or `-strict -2`) to enable it\n- For noise reduction, we'll use the `arnndn` filter with a pre-trained noise reduction model\n\nAssumptions: I'm using a generic noise reduction model that should be available in most ffmpeg installations. If you need to train a custom model, the path would need to be adjusted accordingly.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -af \"arnndn=mix.species\" -c:a flac -strict experimental audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Evaluating the model's output against the issue description:\nThe user requested to extract audio from a video and save it as FLAC while applying noise reduction. The model's output includes a command that extracts audio (with the `-vn` flag), specifies the FLAC codec, and applies noise reduction using the `arnndn` filter. There are no apparent issues concerning the command's ability to meet the user's requirements based on what was provided. Thus, the output does **not** contain the issue described.\n\n2) Considering the similarity to the failure example:\nThe failure example provided indicates a command with an invalid preset (`-preset extra_fast`). The command constructed by the model does not contain any invalid options; all specified flags and options are permissible according to the FFmpeg man page and should produce the expected behavior. Therefore, it does **not** resemble the example of a failing output.\n\n3) Assessing compliance with the FFmpeg man page:\nLooking through the man page, the options and arguments included in the model's command (such as `-vn`, `-c:a flac`, `-strict experimental`, and `-af \"arnndn=mix.species\"`) do not break any stated requirements. The order of options is correct, and the parameters are acceptable. Therefore, this command adheres to the rules and conventions specified in the FFmpeg man page.\n\n4) Final assessment:\nGiven the above factors, the model's output is correct and effectively addresses all the user's specifications without any errors or invalid commands. Therefore, this output passes the evaluation criteria as it meets the user requirements, does not resemble a failing example, and adheres to the FFmpeg command structure as described in the man page. The output is accurate, functional, and appropriately formatted for the requested task."
