  "output": "To map the third video stream and the second audio stream from `multi.avi` into a single output file called `final.mp4`, you can use the `-map` option to explicitly select which streams you want. In FFmpeg, stream indices start at 0; therefore:\n\n- The third video stream would be `-map 0:v:2` (assuming the streams are in a sequential order: 0:v:0 is the first video stream, 0:v:1 is the second, etc.).\n- The second audio stream would be `-map 0:a:1`.\n\nYou will also need to specify the codecs and settings to ensure the output container (MP4) is appropriate for video encoding. Here, I'll use H.264 for video encoding with a good quality preset, and copy the audio stream because it's more efficient.\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi.avi -map 0:v:2 -map 0:a:1 -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a copy final.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-map 0:v:2` selects the third video stream from the input.\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream from the input.\n- `-c:v libx264` encodes the video stream with the H.264 codec (widely compatible in MP4).\n- `-preset fast` balances encoding speed and quality.\n- `-crf 23` controls video quality (lower numbers mean better quality; 23 is typical).\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio without re-encoding, saving processing time and ensuring no quality loss.\n- `final.mp4` is the output container.\n\nMake sure your input file has at least two streams (a third video stream and a second audio stream) as specified. Adjust the stream indices if your input file contains streams in a different order.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nNo, the model's output does not contain an issue. The generated ffmpeg command correctly maps the specified video and audio streams from the input file to the output file without any syntactical or logical errors. It appropriately uses `-map` to select the desired streams and specifies appropriate codecs for the output.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**  \nNo, the model's output is not similar to the provided failing example. The failure example shows a command with a non-existent preset (`extra_fast`), whereas the model's output uses valid options and syntax. The command correctly identifies the stream indices and applies valid codec choices.\n\n3) **Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**  \nNo, the command does not break any requirements stated in the man page for ffmpeg. It adheres to the correct syntax, specifying the input file, the required stream mappings, and using valid options for codec selection. All options used in the command are recognized and correctly formatted according to ffmpeg's documentation.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**  \nIt should pass if it does not contain the issue, and fail if it does contain the issue. In this case, the evaluation should **pass** since the command is valid, follows all requirements in the ffmpeg man page, and meets the user's specified needs."
