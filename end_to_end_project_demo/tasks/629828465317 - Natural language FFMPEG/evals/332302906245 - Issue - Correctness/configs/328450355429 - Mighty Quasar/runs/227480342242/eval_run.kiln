  "input": "I need to map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from my complex media file input.mov to create a single output",
  "output": "<think>\n\n</think>\n\nTo map specific streams from an input file, use the `-map` option which allows selective copying or processing of streams. In your case:\n\n- `-map 0:v:6` selects the 7th video stream (stream indices start at 0), and\n- `-map 0:a:13` selects the 14th audio stream (again, 0-based index). \n\nMapping these streams creates a new file with only these streams included. This method does not re-encode the streams; it just copies them as-is, which is fast and lossless.\n\nAssuming you want to copy the streams without encoding (the most efficient and lossless approach), here is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mov -map 0:v:6 -map 0:a:13 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding.\n- This command will work if the container format (e.g., MP4) can contain the imported streams. If not, consider using `-f mov` or the original container.\n\nIf you wanted to re-encode instead, just change `-c copy` to e.g. `-c:v libx264` for video and `-c:a aac` for audio.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated appears to correctly map the 7th video stream and 14th audio stream from the input file, resembling the user's request.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The generated command is valid and correctly uses existing ffmpeg options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It correctly uses the `-map` option with zero-based indexing and the `-c copy` option, which are both valid according to the ffmpeg documentation.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as it successfully generated a valid command that meets the user's requirements. Therefore, it should pass the evaluation."
