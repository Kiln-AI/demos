  "input": "I need to extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as a FLAC file using the maximum_compression preset",
  "output": "To extract audio from video.mp4 and save it as FLAC, we use stream copy when possible, but since FLAC is a different codec than what's likely in the MP4 (AAC), we'll need to decode and encode. For maximum compression, we'll use the `-compression_level 8` option, which is the highest compression level FLAC offers (range 0-8).\n\nSince you mentioned \"maximum_compression preset\" and FLAC doesn't have named presets like libx264, I'm interpreting this as using FLAC's maximum compression level.\n\n- `-vn` disables video processing\n- `-map 0:a` selects all audio streams\n- `-c:a flac` specifies FLAC encoder\n- `-compression_level 8` sets maximum compression (slower encoding but smaller file)\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -map 0:a -c:a flac -compression_level 8 audio.flac\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated by the model correctly identifies the need to extract audio from an MP4 video file and output it in FLAC format with the appropriate parameters for maximum compression. There are no mistakes in the command that would cause it to fail based on the requirements from the user.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output provided. The command generated does not reference any non-existent options or presets; rather, it correctly uses the `-compression_level 8` option, which is valid for FLAC encoding.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The options used are valid and appropriate for audio extraction and encoding in FLAC format. The use of `-vn`, `-map`, `-c:a`, and `-compression_level` is consistent with the options available in ffmpeg.\n\n4) Considering the above evaluative steps, the output does not contain any issues and successfully meets the userâ€™s request. Therefore, it should pass this evaluation."
