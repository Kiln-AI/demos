  "input": "Please take `movie.mkv` and hardcode the `subtitles.srt` file into it. The subtitles should be yellow.",
  "output": "To hardcode subtitle `subtitles.srt` into `movie.mkv` with the text color yellow, you need to use the subtitles filter in ffmpeg, which supports overlaying subtitles onto the video background or onto the screen using a solid box with text. Setting the text color to yellow means we'll render the subtitles as a colored text layer.\n\nHere's the approach:\n\n- Use `-vf` (video filter) with the `hardcode` or `subtitles` filter to burn the subtitle text onto the video.\n- To achieve a fixed yellow-colored subtitle, you can use the `box=drawtext` filter with `fontcolor=yellow`.\n- The `:ratio` with the `subtitles` filter requires selecting the subtitle input as `subtitles.srt`.\n- For true internal hardcoding without re-encoding the video to a full 2D image, use `hardcode` with `subtitles`.\n- To ensure the subtitles are displayed directly on the video frames without extra decoding paths, use `subtitles` filter with `forced_style=PrimaryStyle` or `box` filter with `drawtext`.\n- The output container remains MKV, which supports subtitles properly.\n\nAssumption: Your `subtitles.srt` is properly encoded UTF-8 and has visible text (no images or embedded images like images.srt).\n\nChoosing to use the `box=drawtext` method for a box with yellow text instead of just subtitles because it allows full control over the appearance:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -vf \"boxdrawtext=text='%{subtitles}':fontname=Arial:fontcolor=yellow:boxcolor=0xEEEE00:boxw=800:boxh=50:x=10:y=10\" movie_with_subtitles.mkv\n```\n\n### Details:  \n- `boxdrawtext` draws text inside a box.\n- `box=boxdrawtext...` draws the box on the video frames.\n- `fontcolor=yellow` sets the text color to yellow.\n- 800x50 box size makes the subtitle box visible even if it's outside a frame edge.\n- `x=10` and `y=10` place the box in the bottom right corner.\n- You can adjust the box size and position as needed.\n- `-c copy` copies all video and audio streams directly to avoid re-encoding, including the hardcoded subtitles.\n  \nIf you want the subtitles on the screen only (without caption box), the `force_style` or more advanced filters are needed, but this produces a direct hardcoded subtitle overlay with yellow text on a yellow box or the background.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output does contain issues. The command generated for hardcoding subtitles into the video is incorrect in its implementation. Specifically, the use of `boxdrawtext` is not the correct approach for hardcoding subtitles from an SRT file. The standard way to hardcode subtitles in FFmpeg is to utilize the `subtitles` filter directly and not utilize the `drawtext` or `boxdrawtext` options incorrectly. The parameters included do not align with the requirements specified by the user.\n\n2) The model's output is somewhat similar to the failure example in that it generates a command that likely won't execute successfully. While it doesnâ€™t contain a clearly non-existent option like `extra_fast`, it does misuse existing filters and options, leading one to believe the command would not work as intended.\n\n3) Based on the FFmpeg man page, the command as generated indeed breaks the requirements specified within it. The command should have used the `subtitles` filter to directly apply the subtitle file contents onto the video instead of the method suggested in the output. Thus, it is not in accordance with FFmpeg usage as outlined in provided examples. \n\n4) The model's output fails because it does not follow the correct approach for hardcoding subtitles and therefore will not produce a working command that meets the user's request. The output should have recommended a command with the correct use of the `subtitles` filter without additional and unrelated complexities. \n\nIn conclusion, the model's command fails on multiple levels and should be marked down for not properly addressing the user's requirements for hardcoding subtitles with the specified color."
