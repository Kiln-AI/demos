  "output": "To extract all frames from a video as individual PNG images, you'll use ffmpeg's image extraction capabilities. The command will decode each frame and save them as sequentially numbered PNG files in the specified directory.\n\n- `-i video.mp4` specifies the input video file\n- `frames/frame_%04d.png` sets the output pattern where %04d creates 4-digit zero-padded numbers (frame_0001.png, frame_0002.png, etc.)\n- The PNG format is automatically detected from the file extension\n- `-q:v 1` sets the highest quality for the extracted frames\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -q:v 1 frames/frame_%04d.png\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described in the <issue_description>. The command provided is correctly formulated and achieves the goal of extracting all frames from a video into a specified folder as individual PNG images.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output provided in the <failure_example>. The command does not contain any invalid options or unsupported presets. The command is standard and should operationally perform as expected.\n\n3) The command provided by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. It follows the correct syntax and uses valid options for image extraction.\n\n4) Since the model's output successfully meets the task requirements and maintains compliance with the ffmpeg man page, it passes the evaluation."
