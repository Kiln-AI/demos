  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to extract only the third audio stream and the first video stream into a new file. The input file is movie.mkv and I want the output as final.mp4",
  "output": "To extract the third audio stream and the first video stream from `movie.mkv` and create a new file `final.mp4`, we can use the `map` option in `ffmpeg`. This allows us to selectively choose which streams to include in the output file.\n\nHere's the explanation:\n- `-map 0:0` tells `ffmpeg` to map the first video stream (index 0) from the input file.\n- `-map 0:2` tells `ffmpeg` to map the third audio stream (index 2) from the input file.\n- `-c copy` instructs `ffmpeg` to copy the streams without re-encoding, which is more efficient when extracting streams without altering quality.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:0 -map 0:2 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will extract the first video stream and the third audio stream from `movie.mkv` and encode them into `final.mp4` without re-encoding, preserving the original quality.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The provided `ffmpeg` command correctly extracts the specified audio and video streams from the input file `movie.mkv` and outputs them to a new file `final.mp4`.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the provided example of a failing output. The command generated by the model (`-c copy`) is valid, and it does not contain any invalid or non-existent options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The use of `-map` to specify which streams to include is correct, and the use of `-c copy` is valid for copying streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Since the command functions as intended, includes valid options, and adheres to the specifications provided in the task, it passes the evaluation criteria. The output is accurate, efficient, and matches the user's requirements."
