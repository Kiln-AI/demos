  "input": "Extract frames from my video.avi every 2 seconds and save them as PNG images with ultra high resolution.",
  "output": " To extract frames from the `video.avi` file at an interval of every 2 seconds and save them as high-resolution PNG images, you need to adjust the `-vf` (video filter) parameter to set the counter interval and use the higher resolution parameters available in the `libx264` encoder for the video codec, if it's supported for exporting raw video frames. However, `ffmpeg` typically doesn't directly provide an option to encode to raw format, but we can leverage the concept of sysroots for video file creation, but be aware that this can result in large files.\n\nAssuming that you are using a system that supports `x264` encoding to raw 4K resolution:\n\n- The `-vf` parameter is used to apply video filters. We'll use `fps=2` to set the frame rate to 2 frames per second (since you want one frame every 2 seconds).\n- The `-q:v 2` parameter can be set for high quality.\n- You might need to modify the `videocodec` sub-filter if you want a specific codec that offers ultra-high resolution, but in practice, capturing truly ultra-high resolution may require higher-end hardware at the time and may not be directly accessible via `ffmpeg` without encoding back to a lossy format.\n- `-r` will force the frame rate despite the initial interval set by `-vf fps=2`.\n- `-profile:v high` and `-level:v 4.0` to use the highest quality for the output.\n- `-x264-params 'level=4.0:mb=0:subme=7:maxrate=0:vb=0:field_order=change_frame_rate'` to ensure the highest level AVC bitrate for the highest quality, assuming that level 4.0 is supported.\n- `-frames:v 1` to specify that only one frame per second should be processed.\n- `-s hd1440x1440` to set the resolution to 1440x1080, which is not true ultra-high resolution but demonstrates the process.\n\nHere's the command based on these assumptions:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.avi -an -r 2 -f image2 -vcodec rawvideo -vf \"fps=2,setsar=1\" -vsync vfr -s hd1440x1440 -q:v 2 -x264-params 'level=4.0:mb=0:subme=7:maxrate=0:vb=0:field_order=change_frame_rate' ./img%04d.png\n```\n\nIn practice, using `ffmpeg` for ultra-high resolutions would likely result in other high-quality video encoding options instead of raw files, since direct raw video encoding is based on a specialized API not natively supported by `ffmpeg`. If you still wish to focus on raw video files and truly high resolution, make sure you have the right kind of hardware and software configuration that supports it.\n\nIt's important to note that this may not yield \"ultra high resolution\" frames in the traditional sense, as this typically involves very large file sizes and potential hardware-specific considerations.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Yes, the model's output contains the issue described. The command generated does not accurately fulfill the user's request and contains several incorrect parameters that would lead to its failure in execution. For instance, `-vcodec rawvideo` is incorrectly applied when the task is to extract frames, and the output suggests improper use of other parameters.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the failure example provided, as it includes invalid parameters and misuses available options. For example, the use of `-vcodec rawvideo` is not valid in the context of extracting frames and saving them as images.\n\n3) Yes, the command violates several requirements specified in the ffmpeg man page. Specifically:\n   - The option `-vcodec rawvideo` is incorrect for creating image output files (PNG) as this does not apply to frame extraction; the proper codec should be `-f image2`.\n   - The `-x264-params` options are irrelevant in this context since no video encoding is required when extracting frames to images.\n   - The specifications such as `-s hd1440x1440` do not command \"ultra high resolution\" and are incompatible with the user's request to save ultra high-resolution frames. Also, `hd1440x1440` is a non-standard resolution.\n\n4) Overall, the model's output does contain the issue described, indicating a failure in generating a correct `ffmpeg` command that meets the user requirements for extracting frames as PNG images every 2 seconds. Thus, it fails this evaluation."
