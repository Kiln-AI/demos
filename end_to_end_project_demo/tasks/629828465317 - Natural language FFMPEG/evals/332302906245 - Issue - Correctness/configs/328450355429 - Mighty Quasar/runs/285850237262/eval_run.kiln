  "input": "I have a video file with multiple audio tracks and I want to map the third audio stream to the output, but keep the original video. The input file is movie.mkv",
  "output": "To keep the original video stream and map only the third audio stream to the output, you can use the `-map` option. This allows you to specify which streams go into the output file.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from the input (assuming you want to keep the original video).\n- `-map 0:a:2` selects the third audio stream (audio streams are zero-indexed, so `2` is the third).\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the selected audio stream without re-encoding.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c:v copy -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nAssumption: The third audio stream exists and is at index 2, and the video stream is the first video stream at index 0. The output container is MKV to support multiple audio formats without re-encoding.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does **not** contain the issue described. The command generated by the model correctly specifies the mapping of the video and audio streams while adhering to the requirements stated by the user. The command will function as intended, keeping the original video and only taking the specified audio track from the input file.\n\n2) The model's output is **not** similar to the example of a failing output. The output command provided by the model does not contain any incorrect parameters or invalid commands, unlike the example failure command which contained a non-existent preset.\n\n3) The command generated by the model does **not** break any requirements dictated in the man page for ffmpeg. The options used to map the video and audio streams are valid, and the use of `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` is appropriate for keeping the original streams without re-encoding.\n\n4) Given the evaluation of the above points, the model's output **passes** as it does not contain any issues related to the requirements of the task. The command is correct and follows the appropriate usage of ffmpeg parameters."
