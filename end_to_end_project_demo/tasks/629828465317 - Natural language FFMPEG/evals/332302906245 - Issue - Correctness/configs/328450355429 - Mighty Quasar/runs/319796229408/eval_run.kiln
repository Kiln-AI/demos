  "input": "I need to convert a video file and set the bitrate to exactly 64 Tbps for archival purposes.",
  "output": "Setting a video bitrate to exactly 64 Terabits per second (Tbps) means 64,000,000,000,000 bits per second, which is 8,000,000,000,000 bytes per second (or about 8 TB/s)â€”an extremely high and impractical value for any video file. However, if you need to set the bitrate parameter to this value for archival/testing or compliance, you can use the `-b:v` option to specify the desired video bitrate.\n\n**Note:** \n- ffmpeg uses \"k\" for kilobits, \"M\" for megabits, and \"G\" for gigabits in bitrate parameters.\n- 1 Tbps = 1,000,000 Mbps = 1,000,000,000 kbps = 1,000,000,000,000 bps.\n- For 64 Tbps: 64,000,000,000,000 bps = 64,000,000,000 kbps = 64,000,000 Mbps.\n\nHere's the command (assuming input.mp4 and output.mp4; adjust as needed):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 64000000000k output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-b:v 64000000000k` sets the video bitrate to 64,000,000,000 kilobits per second (64 Tbps).\n- This value is much higher than any practical use. Most codecs, systems, and file formats will either cap or fail at this bitrate.\n\n**Assumption:**\n- The actual file may not reach this bitrate due to codec/file limitations. This is more of a theoretical setting.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output contains the issue described in the issue description. Although the command generated is syntactically correct, the specified bitrate of 64 Tbps is unrealistic and impractical for any real-world application, including archival purposes since no codec or file format could support such a high bitrate. Therefore, it does fail to meet the realistic requirements of the user.\n\n2) The model's output is similar to the example of a failing output, as the command provided will likely not work in practice due to the absurdly high bitrate. While the syntax is technically correct, the use of an impractically high value is a significant flaw that likely leads to failure in the real-world execution of the command. The failure example focuses more on incorrect syntax than on logic, but in this case, the command aligns with the syntax rules and includes a valid option; thus it's a different type of failure.\n\n3) The command itself does not break any requirements dictated in the man page. The option `-b:v` is valid for setting video bitrate, and the command adheres to the general rules and expected format. However, the extraordinarily high bitrate value may lead to performance or compatibility issues with most codecs and systems which simply cannot handle that degree of data throughput.\n\nOverall, the command is syntactically correct but conceptually impractical, which results in it failing the evaluation criteria."
