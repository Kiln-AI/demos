  "input": "Can you help me map the second video stream and fourth audio stream from my source file complex.avi? I want them in the output",
  "output": "To map specific streams from your source file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so:\n- `-map 0:v:1` selects the second video stream (index 1) from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:3` selects the fourth audio stream (index 3) from input 0\n\nThis assumes you want to keep the original codecs. If you need to re-encode for compatibility, you can add codec parameters like `-c:v libx264 -c:a aac`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i complex.avi -map 0:v:1 -map 0:a:3 -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nNote: I used `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding (faster, no quality loss) and `.mkv` as the output format since it has excellent support for multiple streams. If you need a specific output format or codec, let me know and I can adjust the command accordingly.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Does the model's output contain the issue described?\nThe model's output does not contain the issue described. The generated command correctly maps the desired streams and uses valid FFMpeg syntax. It successfully executes the mapping of the second video stream and fourth audio stream, matching the user's requirement without introducing incorrect or unsupported options.\n\n2) Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The output contains a valid FFMpeg command, correctly utilizing the `-map` options to specify the desired streams without any invalid parameters.\n\n3) Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?\nThe command generated by the model adheres to the requirements set forth in the man page for FFMpeg. The use of `-map` is compliant, as well as the command structure itself: input file specification followed by output formatting options.\n\n4) Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described? \nThe model's output does not contain the issue described; thus, it passes this evaluation step. The command is valid, properly formatted, and meets the user's requirements without introducing any errors or unsupported options."
