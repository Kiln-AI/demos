  "input": "Add subtitles to my video and also remove all existing subtitle tracks at the same time",
  "output": "To add subtitles to your video while removing all existing subtitle tracks, you can use two input files: the original video and the subtitle file. The command will map only the video and audio streams from the original file, discard any subtitle tracks, and add the new subtitle as a separate track. If your subtitle file is in `.srt` format and you want to ensure compatibility with MP4, use the `mov_text` codec. Also assume the subtitle file is named `subtitles.srt`.\n\n- `-i subtitles.srt` specifies the input subtitle file.  \n- `-map 0:v` and `-map 0:a` include the original video and audio streams.  \n- `-map 1:s` adds the new subtitle track from the subtitle file.  \n- `-c:v copy` and `-c:a copy` preserve the original video and audio codecs.  \n- `-c:s mov_text` encodes subtitles in MP4-compatible format.  \n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a -map 1:s -c:v copy -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output.mp4\n```\n\n**Alternative (if burning subtitles into the video):**  \nIf you want to embed subtitles directly into the video (burning them in) and remove existing tracks, use:  \n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -i subtitles.srt -c:v copy -c:a copy -filter_complex \"subtitles=subtitles.srt\" output.mp4\n```  \nThis approach replaces existing subtitles with the new ones, but assumes no other subtitle tracks are present.",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described in the issue description. The command generated serves the user's request correctly by adding new subtitles and removing existing ones, which is supported by the command's parameters. Additionally, all streams that need to be preserved are explicitly included, while others are discarded.\n\n2) The output generated by the model is dissimilar to the example of a failing output. In the specified failure example, the command contains an unsupported preset (\"extra_fast\"), while the model's output commands are valid according to the FFmpeg documentation and do not include any such unsupported options.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the FFmpeg man page provided. It follows the correct syntax for input options, stream mapping, codec specification, and it adheres to the rules regarding the order and application of options, ensuring proper output stream behavior.\n\n4) The model's output does not contain the issue described, as the command is valid and properly fulfills the user's request without any mistakes that would result in command failure. Therefore, the evaluation would pass."
