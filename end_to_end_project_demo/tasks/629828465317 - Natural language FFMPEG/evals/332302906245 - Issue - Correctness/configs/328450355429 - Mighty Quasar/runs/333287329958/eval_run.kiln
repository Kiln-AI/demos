  "input": "Please stabilize my shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. Use the `deshake` filter.",
  "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user wants to stabilize their shaky video called 'bumpy_ride.mp4' using the deshake filter. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that FFmpeg has a deshake filter, but I need to recall how it works. The deshake filter uses the 'vidstab' library, which is part of FFmpeg. However, the user might not have that installed by default. Wait, the user might not be aware of that. So I should mention that they need to have the vidstab library installed. But maybe they already have it? Or maybe they need to install it via a package manager like apt or using a build from source. But since the user is asking for a command, I should include the necessary parameters.\n\nThe deshake filter can be applied with the 'deshake' filter. The command would include the -filter_complex option. Alternatively, using the -vf option with deshake. Wait, the deshake filter is part of the vf (video filter) complex. But I think the correct syntax is to use -vf deshake. However, sometimes you need to use filter_complex for more complex scenarios, but for basic deshake, maybe -vf is sufficient.\n\nWait, actually, the deshake filter might require some parameters. For example, the number of frames to use for stabilization. The default might be okay, but perhaps adding a parameter like 'strength' could help. However, the user didn't specify any parameters, so I should stick to the basic command.\n\nSo the command would be something like: ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake output.mp4. But I should check if the vidstab library is needed. If the user doesn't have it installed, they might get an error. So in the explanation, I should mention that they need to ensure that FFmpeg was compiled with vidstab support. If they don't have it, they might need to install it or use a different method.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is on a system where vidstab is available by default. But to be safe, I should include that note. Also, the deshake filter might require some additional parameters. For example, the 'minradius' or 'maxradius' for the stabilization. But since the user didn't specify, I'll use the default settings.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the deshake filter might not work perfectly on all videos. It might require some manual adjustment. But since the user just wants to apply the deshake filter, the basic command should suffice.\n\nSo putting it all together, the command would be to use -vf deshake. But I should check the correct syntax. Let me verify. Yes, the correct syntax is -vf deshake. So the command is straightforward. However, the user might need to have vidstab installed. So in the explanation, I should mention that they need to have FFmpeg with vidstab support, and if not, they might need to install it. Also, note that the deshake filter might require some additional parameters for optimal results, but the basic command is as above.\n\nWait, another thought: the deshake filter is part of the vidstab library, which is a separate component. So the user might need to install it via a package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, they could install ffmpeg with the --enable-libvidstab option during compilation, or maybe it's included by default. If they don't have it, the command will fail. So I should mention that in the assumptions. Also, the output video might have a different frame rate or resolution, so maybe they need to adjust that. But the user didn't mention any specific requirements, so the basic command should work.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should include the command with -vf deshake and a note about the vidstab library requirement.\n</think>\n\nTo stabilize the shaky video `bumpy_ride.mp4` using FFmpeg's `deshake` filter, we leverage the `vidstab` library (part of FFmpeg). This filter estimates and corrects camera shake by analyzing motion patterns. The command assumes FFmpeg is compiled with `--enable-libvidstab` support (common in many distributions).\n\n- `vf deshake` applies the stabilization filter with default parameters (adjustable via options like `strength` if needed).\n- If `vidstab` is not available, the command will fail; ensure FFmpeg is built with this library or install it via your system's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake stabilized_ride.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the described issue. The command generated (`ffmpeg -i bumpy_ride.mp4 -vf deshake stabilized_ride.mp4`) is formatted correctly and aligns with the task of stabilizing the input video `bumpy_ride.mp4`. However, it lacks a note about the possible requirement for the `vidstab` library, which could lead to issues for some users.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the failing output example provided. The command generated by the model is technically correct in terms of FFmpeg syntax, unlike the failure example where an invalid preset was used. It follows the expected pattern of input, filter, and output.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the man page for FFmpeg. The syntax `-i input.mp4 -vf deshake output.mp4` adheres to FFmpeg's general rules, with the correct order of options, and it calls a valid video filter without conflicting with any specified options.\n\n4) The model's output is acceptable as it does not contain the issues described. However, it could be improved by explicitly mentioning the need for the `vidstab` library to avoid confusion for users who might not have it installed. Thus, the output should pass in the evaluation criteria."
