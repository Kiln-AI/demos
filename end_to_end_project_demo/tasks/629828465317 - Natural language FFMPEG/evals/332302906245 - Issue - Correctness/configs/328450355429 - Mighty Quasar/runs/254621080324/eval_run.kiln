  "input": "I want to set the audio bitrate to 500k and video bitrate to 100 Gbps for high quality output.",
  "output": "To achieve high-quality output with the specified bitrates, you should explicitly set the video bitrate to a very high value (though 100 Gbps is extremely large and may be impractical; typical high-quality videos are in the range of tens to hundreds of Mbps). The audio bitrate is straightforward. \n\n- Use `-b:v 100G` to set the video bitrate to 100 gigabits per second (be aware this is extremely high and may not be practical for most applications).\n- Use `-b:a 500k` for the audio bitrate.\n- Choose appropriate codecs; typically, `libx264` for video and `aac` for audio.\n\nAssumption: You want to keep the resolution and other parameters unchanged and focus solely on bitrate settings.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 100G -b:a 500k -c:v libx264 -c:a aac output_high_bitrate.mp4\n```",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described here?**\n   - Yes, the command generated by the model has an issue. The proposed video bitrate of 100 Gbps (which is equivalent to 100,000 Mbps) is impractical and exceeds typical constraints for video processing and playback. While the formation of the command itself is generally correct, the parameter value is unrealistic.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of failing output?**\n   - No, the output does not match the specific failing example provided. The command doesn't contain a completely invalid argument (like a non-existent preset), but the bitrate value is excessive and unrealistic.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\n   - The command does not break explicit syntax rules outlined in the man page. Statements and options used in the command are all applicable according to the ffmpeg documentation. However, the specified video bitrate (100 Gbps) does not conform to practical usage guidelines and would likely exceed the capability of both encoding hardware and typical software implementations.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\n   - Yes, the output contains an issue by suggesting an implausibly high bitrate (100 Gbps). This would likely render the command unusable in practical scenarios, which aligns with the requirement in the task to ensure that the command generated works correctly and matches user requirements."
