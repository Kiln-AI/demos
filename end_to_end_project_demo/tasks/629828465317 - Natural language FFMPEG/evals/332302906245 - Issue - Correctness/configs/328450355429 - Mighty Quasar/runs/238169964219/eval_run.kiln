  "input": "I want to stack two videos vertically. Put `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, and save it as `stacked.mp4`.",
  "output": "To vertically stack `top_video.mp4` on top of `bottom_video.mp4`, the `vstack` filter is used. This filter requires both videos to have the same width. The first input is placed at the bottom, and the second input is stacked above it. If the videos have different resolutions, you must first scale them to match. The output will have double the height of each input, assuming they are the same resolution. This approach assumes both videos have matching durations and widths; otherwise, the result may include black borders or truncated frames.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i bottom_video.mp4 -i top_video.mp4 -filter_complex vstack=inputs=2 stacked.mp4\n```\n\n**Note:** If the videos have different widths, add `scale=width:height` to both inputs to standardize dimensions. For example:  \n`-filter_complex \"[0:v]scale=1280:720[v1];[1:v]scale=1280:720[v2];[v1][v2]vstack=inputs=2\"`  \n(Replace `1280:720` with the target resolution.)",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, the model's output does contain the issue described. The command it generated did not account for the possibility that `top_video.mp4` and `bottom_video.mp4` may have different widths, and therefore might not work without scaling both inputs. The model's explanation correctly mentioned that the widths should match, but the initial command did not include scaling options for videos that do not have the same width.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to this example of a failing output?**\nNo, the model's output is not similar to the example of a failing output given. The command produced is syntactically correct and does use valid filters; it correctly identifies the need to stack the videos using the `vstack` filter. It does not contain any outright nonexistent parameters or keywords like the `extra_fast` preset example.\n\n3) **Here is the man page for ffmpeg. Does the command break any requirements dictated in the man page?**\nThe command generated does not explicitly break any requirements, but it does fail to incorporate necessary options to ensure the command works as intended. The command would fail if the input videos have different widths, as the `vstack` filter requires the same width for both input videos. Therefore, while the command itself adheres to the syntax rules dictated in the man page, it does not fulfill the functional requirements because it lacks the scaling steps that could prevent errors when the videos differ in width.\n\n4) **Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?**\nYes, it fails because it does not handle the potential difference in video widths adequately. Therefore, it should be marked as a failure due to the omission of necessary scaling commands. The model's command could lead to unsuccessful execution in cases where the videos do not align properly."
