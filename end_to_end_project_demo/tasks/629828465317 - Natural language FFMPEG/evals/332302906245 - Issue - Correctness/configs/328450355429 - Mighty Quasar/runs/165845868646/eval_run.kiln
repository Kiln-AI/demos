  "output": "You want to rotate the video 90 degrees clockwise and add fade-in and fade-out effects. The `transpose=1` filter rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise. The `fade` filter adds a fade-in and fade-out effect. The parameters specify the fade-in duration (0 seconds), the fade-out duration (270 degrees, which is 30 seconds), and the fade duration (30 seconds).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"transpose=1,fade=in:0:30,fade=out:270:30\" output.mp4\n```\n",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) The model's output does not contain the issue described. The command generated is correct as it matches the user's request for chaining filters to rotate the video and add fade effects. The specified filters and their parameters are syntactically and semantically correct.\n\n2) The model's output is not similar to the given failure example. The command generated by the model correctly uses existing and valid options for the `ffmpeg` command, whereas the failure example contains an invalid preset that does not exist.\n\n3) The command does not break any requirements dictated in the ffmpeg man page. The command generated adheres to the syntax and options outlined in the man page, including the correct application of video filters in the `-vf` option.\n\n4) Considering the evaluation above, the model's output does not contain the issue described. Therefore, it passes the evaluation."
