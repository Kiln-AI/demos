  "input": "My file `archive.mkv` has three audio tracks. I need to extract the second audio track and the main video track into a new file `output.mp4` without re-encoding anything.",
  "output": "To extract the second audio track and main video track without re-encoding, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` option and copy codecs to avoid transcoding. This preserves quality and processes much faster since no encoding occurs.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first (main) video stream\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (0-indexed, so index 1 is the second track)\n- `-c copy` copies both video and audio streams without re-encoding\n- The output container MP4 will remux the streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "1) Evaluating the response:\n\n- Valid and Runnable Command: The provided ffmpeg command is runnable with no invalid flags or parameters but has an incorrect stream index for the second audio track. The command specifies `-map 0:a:2`, which mistakenly maps the third audio track due to 0-based indexing (0, 1, 2). The correct mapping should be `-map 0:a:1` for the second audio track.\n  \n- Following User Request: The model correctly explains the method to extract the second audio track and main video track by using stream mapping and copying codecs to avoid re-encoding. However, the implementation in the command is incorrect due to the wrong audio track index. \n\n- Explaining Assumptions: The model doesn't explicitly state any assumptions but the explanation correctly describes the use of stream mapping and `-c copy` to preserve quality and speed up processing.\n\nOverall, the command is close to correct but fails to accurately fulfill the user request due to the incorrect selection of the audio track. Therefore, the eval should fail because the command will not work as expected given the user's input.\n\nCorrected Command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:1 -c copy output.mp4\n```"
