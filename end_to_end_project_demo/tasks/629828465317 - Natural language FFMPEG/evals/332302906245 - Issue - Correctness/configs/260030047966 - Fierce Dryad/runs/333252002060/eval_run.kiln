  "input": "I want to apply multiple audio filters - normalize volume, remove noise, and add a fade in/out effect. Can you show me the filter chain syntax?",
  "output": "To apply multiple audio filters in sequence, you'll use the `-af` (audio filter) parameter with filters separated by commas. This creates a filter chain where audio passes through each filter in order: volume normalization, noise reduction, and fade effects.\n\nFor your specific requirements:\n- `dynaudnorm` normalizes volume dynamically\n- `afftdn` removes noise using spectral subtraction\n- `afade` adds fade in and fade out effects\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"dynaudnorm,afftdn=nr=10,afade=t=in:ss=0:d=2;afade=t=out:st=58:d=2\" output.wav\n```\n\nThe filter chain applies:\n1. Dynamic audio normalization to even out volume levels\n2. FFT denoising with noise reduction factor of 10\n3. 2-second fade in starting at 0 seconds, followed by 2-second fade out starting at 58 seconds (adjust timing based on your audio length)\n\nThe semicolon separates the two fade filters since they're both `afade` filters with different parameters.",
  "intermediate_outputs": {
    "chain_of_thought": "1) Evaluate Criteria Step by Step\n\n- **Valid and Runnable Command**: \n  - The command uses `-af` for audio filtering, which is correct for chaining multiple audio filters.\n  - The filters used are `dynaudnorm` for dynamic audio normalization, `afftdn` for noise reduction, and `afade` for fade effects, all of which are valid FFmpeg audio filters.\n  - This command should run successfully given that the input file and output file formats specified (WAV) are supported for these operations.\n\n- **Follows User Request**: \n  - The task accurately follows the user's request to apply audio normalization, noise reduction, and fade in/out effects.\n  - `dynaudnorm` is correctly used to normalize volume.\n  - `afftdn` with `nr=10` is used for noise reduction. This appears logical, although the effectiveness depends on the audio content.\n  - The model correctly applies two separate afade filters, with a semicolon for separation. This approach addresses the user's request for both a fade in and fade out effect.\n  - The example assumes an audio length of around 60 seconds, which is a reasonable assumption to demonstrate fade in/out usage.\n\nThe model's response meets both criteria, producing a valid, executable command while adhering to the user's request for the specified audio processing steps.\n\n**Conclusion**: The evaluation passes. The model produces a valid FFmpeg command that correctly implements the requested audio processing techniques."
