  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 6 audio streams. I need to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12 for my output file final.mp4",
  "output": "To select specific streams from a multi-stream file, you use the `-map` parameter to specify which input streams to include in the output. This allows you to cherry-pick exactly which video and audio tracks you want.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_index:stream_type:stream_index` where stream indices start from 0. So to select video stream 8 and audio stream 12:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4\n```\n\nThis command:\n- `-map 0:v:8` selects video stream 8 from input 0\n- `-map 0:a:12` selects audio stream 12 from input 0  \n- `-c copy` copies the streams without re-encoding for faster processing\n\nI assumed your input file is named something like `input.mkv` since you didn't specify the filename, and used copy mode to preserve quality and speed up processing.",

    "reasoning": "**Assessing the FFMPEG Command Generation**\n\nOkay, so I'm presented with a user's request to extract specific video and audio streams from an input file. They've told me the file has 4 video streams and 6 audio streams, and they specifically want video stream 8 and audio stream 12. My initial thought is, \"Hmm, sounds like a straightforward application of the `-map` parameter in `ffmpeg`\".  I know `-map` is the right tool; it allows me to select precisely which streams I want in the output. And I'm familiar with the `-map` format:  `input_index:stream_type:stream_index`.\n\nNow, the crucial point is that those stream indices are 0-based, which is something I always keep in mind when working with `ffmpeg`. So, a stream with index 8 would be the ninth stream, and index 12 would be the thirteenth. But wait a minute... the user's input only *has* 4 video and 6 audio streams! The requested streams with indices 8 and 12 *don't exist*!\n\nThis is where the model completely fumbled the ball. Instead of highlighting this discrepancy, which should have been immediately apparent, it blindly plugged the requested numbers (8 and 12) into a `-map` command. The generated command, `ffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v:8 -map 0:a:12 -c copy final.mp4`, *will* fail with an error like \"Stream map '0:v:8' matches no streams.\" This is a significant error, a critical failure in reasoning. The model clearly didn't consider the validity of the *input* relative to the *request*. It should have stopped, raised a flag, and said, \"Hold on, the user is asking for streams that aren't present in the input file,\" rather than generating a command guaranteed to produce an error. The model simply applied the correct syntax but disregarded the crucial semantic context.  I'm labeling this response a failure; while syntactically correct, it is completely semantically incorrect."
