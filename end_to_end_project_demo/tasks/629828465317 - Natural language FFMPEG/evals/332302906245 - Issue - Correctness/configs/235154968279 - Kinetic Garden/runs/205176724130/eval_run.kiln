  "input": "My file `archive.mkv` has three audio tracks. I need to extract the second audio track and the main video track into a new file `output.mp4` without re-encoding anything.",
  "output": "To extract the second audio track and main video track without re-encoding, you'll use stream mapping with the `-map` option and copy codecs to avoid transcoding. This preserves quality and processes much faster since no encoding occurs.\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first (main) video stream\n- `-map 0:a:1` selects the second audio stream (0-indexed, so index 1 is the second track)\n- `-c copy` copies both video and audio streams without re-encoding\n- The output container MP4 will remux the streams\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's performance step by step:\n\nStep 1: Does the model's output contain the issue described (incorrect ffmpeg command that doesn't meet user requirements)?\n\nThe user's request:\n- Extract the second audio track (so, stream index 1, since indexing starts at 0)\n- Extract the main video track (assumed to be the first video track: stream index 0)\n- Output both to an MP4 file, output.mp4\n- Do NOT re-encode (must use -c copy)\n\nThe model's **explanation** says:\n- 0:v:0 is the first video stream\n- 0:a:1 is the second audio stream\n\nBut the **command** is:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThe command uses `0:a:2` instead of `0:a:1` to select the second audio stream. In ffmpeg, stream indices start from 0, so `0:a:0` is the first audio stream, `0:a:1` is the second, and `0:a:2` is the third.\n\nSo **using 0:a:2 will extract the third audio track, not the second.** This directly violates the user's request.\n\nStep 2: Is the model's output similar to the example of a failing output?\n- The failure example uses a non-existent preset; the current output is different, but still contains a critical error: the wrong audio stream is selected.\n\nStep 3: Considering the above, does the model's output contain the issue described?\n- **Yes**, it contains the issue: It does not match the user requirement to extract the second audio stream, instead extracting the third.\n\n**Conclusion:** The model's output should **fail this evaluation** because the generated ffmpeg command does not select the correct audio stream as specified by the user."
