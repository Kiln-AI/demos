  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Step by step evaluation:\n\n1) Does the model's output contain mistakes that would make the ffmpeg command fail or not match requirements?\n\n- The user wants to extract video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of the input file `multi_track.mp4`.\n- The model explains the use of `-map` (correct), including a note about zero-based indexing.\n- The produced command:  \n  ```\n  ffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n  ```\n  This selects stream 2 and stream 7 from input 0 and uses `-c copy` (stream copy).\n\n- Regarding ffmpeg indexing: `-map 0:2` and `-map 0:7` are correct, assuming the user is referring to ffmpeg's internal stream numbers.\n- The use of `-c copy` preserves original codecs, which is also fine unless format compatibilities are a concern.\n- There is no apparent misuse of parameters, no typos, and the command is correct given the assumptions the model made.\n\n2) Comparison to the failure example:\n\n- The model does not introduce a nonexisting preset, nor does it misuse parameters or incorrectly specify a stream.\n\n3) Considering above:\n\n- The output does not contain the issue described. The command should work as intended and matches the user's request.\n\nFinal verdict: **PASS**"
