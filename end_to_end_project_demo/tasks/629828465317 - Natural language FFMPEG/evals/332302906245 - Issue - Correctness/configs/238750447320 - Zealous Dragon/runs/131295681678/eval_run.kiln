  "output": "To convert your MP4 to AVI format with H.265 codec for better compression, I'll use the libx265 encoder which provides excellent compression efficiency. AVI format can handle H.265 streams, and the higher compression will reduce file size significantly compared to H.264.\n\nThe command uses:\n- c:v libx265 for H.265/HEVC video encoding\n- crf 28 for good quality balance (lower values = higher quality)\n- preset medium balances encoding speed and compression\n- c:a copy preserves the original audio without re-encoding\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a copy video.avi\n```",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the step-by-step criteria:\n\n1. **Produces a valid and runnable FFmpeg command:**  \nThe command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a copy video.avi\n```\nThis is syntactically valid and would execute in ffmpeg (assuming all codecs are compiled with the binary).\n\n2. **The produced ffmpeg command follows the user request:**  \n- **Convert video.mp4 to AVI format:** Output file is video.avi – correct.\n- **Use the h265 codec for better compression:** Uses -c:v libx265, which is correct for H.265/HEVC encoding.\n- The explanation notes that AVI “can handle H.265 streams.” This is somewhat misleading: AVI officially supports only limited codecs, and H.265 in AVI is extremely uncommon and risks compatibility issues. But ffmpeg will allow H.265 in AVI, even if most players won't support it. Since the instruction is to do this, the command correctly follows the request.\n- Audio is left as-is with -c:a copy, which is generally sensible unless the user has other audio requests.\n\n3. **No invalid flags or parameters:**  \n- All flags are valid and meaningful.\n\n4. **Notes about correctness:**  \n- The output might not play on most players due to AVI container with H.265: this might deserve a warning, but not necessary for a pass/fail on the command.\n- ffmpeg will permit this operation.\n- The explanation does not warn about compatibility, but this is not required for a pass.\n\n**Final evaluation:**  \n- The command is valid, does what the user asked, and explains the parameters.\n- No invalid flags.\n- The only critique is omission of a warning about poor compatibility of H.265 in AVI, but for this eval that is not a fail.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nPASS"
