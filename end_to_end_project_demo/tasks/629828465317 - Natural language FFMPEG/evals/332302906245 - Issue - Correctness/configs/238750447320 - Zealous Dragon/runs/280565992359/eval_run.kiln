  "input": "I have a file with 4 video streams and 8 audio streams. I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv",
  "output": "To map specific streams from a multi-stream file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select exactly which video and audio streams you want in the output. This allows you to choose specific streams by their indices.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses the format `-map input_file_index:stream_index` where the input file index is typically 0 for the first (and often only) input file, followed by the stream index within that file.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nI'm using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding the streams, which will be faster and maintain original quality. The command maps video stream index 3 (the third video stream) and audio stream index 8 (the eighth audio stream) from the input file to create the output MP4.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let's step through the evaluation against the criteria:\n\n**Did the model produce a valid, runnable ffmpeg command?**\n\nThe output provided:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:3 -map 0:8 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIs this runnable?\n- Yes, the -map, -c copy, and overall syntax are all valid ffmpeg flags.\n\n**Does the produced ffmpeg command follow the user request as much as possible?**\n\nUser request: \"I want to use video stream 0:2 and audio stream 0:7 to create output.mp4 from input.mkv\"\n\nffmpeg stream identifiers:\n- 0:2 refers to the third stream from the first input file (since streams are zero-indexed).\n\nHowever, in ffmpeg, the stream index is global and doesn't differentiate between video and audio unless you use the type specifier (e.g., 0:v:2 for video stream #2).\n\nBut in basic usage, -map 0:2 truly means \"third stream in input\", so the model needed to be sure that in the user file:\n- 0:2 (third stream) is a video stream\n- 0:7 (eighth stream) is an audio stream\n\nThe model, however, used:\n```bash\n-map 0:3 -map 0:8\n```\nThis would map stream #3 and stream #8 of input 0, rather than stream #2 and stream #7 as the user asked. So that's a mistake.\n\nIn addition, the model's explanation aligns with what they did (mapping stream indices 3 and 8, not 2 and 7).\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nThe model correctly described the use of -map and -c copy.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n**Pass or Fail?**  \nFail.\n\n**Reason for fail:**  \nThe command should have mapped streams 0:2 and 0:7 per the userâ€™s request, but it mapped 0:3 and 0:8. The explanation and command both use the wrong indices. This is a clear factual mismatch and leads to a command not following the instruction, even though the syntax is valid. This should fail the eval."
