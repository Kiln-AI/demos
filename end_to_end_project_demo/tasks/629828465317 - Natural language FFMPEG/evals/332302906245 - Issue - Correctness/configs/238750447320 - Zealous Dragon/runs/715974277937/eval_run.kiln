    "chain_of_thought": "Let's evaluate the model's response step by step per the criteria:\n\n## 1. Is the command valid and runnable?\n\nThe command produced is:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i archive.mkv -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:2 -c copy output.mp4\n```\nLet's parse it:\n\n- **-i archive.mkv**: Input file is correctly specified.\n- **-map 0:v:0**: Selects the first video stream from input 0. Valid assumption: main video is typically the first video track.\n- **-map 0:a:2**: Selects the third audio stream (audio stream indices are 0-based).\n- **-c copy**: Copies streams without re-encoding.\n- **output.mp4**: Output file.\n\nAll ffmpeg flags/parameters are valid and properly used. The command is syntactically correct, and will run (assuming the input file meets the described specs).\n\n## 2. Does the command follow the user request?\n\n**User Request:**  \n“My file `archive.mkv` has three audio tracks. I need to extract the second audio track and the main video track into a new file `output.mp4` without re-encoding anything.”\n\n**Breaking it down:**\n- Extract the main video track: Command uses `-map 0:v:0`, which will select the first (main) video stream.\n- Extract the second audio track: Here, numbered as \"second\" by a human, which could mean:\n    - **Index 1** if counting from zero ([0] first, [1] second, [2] third).\n    - But the model uses `-map 0:a:2`, which selects the third audio track (index 2).\n\n**Here is the critical issue**:  \n**User asks for the second audio track, but the model selected the third**.\n\nTherefore, despite everything else being explained and constructed well, the mapping for the audio stream is incorrect relative to the user request.\n\n## 3. Anything else notable?\n\n- The explanation is correct, except for the typo in mapping (the description says \"selects the second audio stream\", but the actual command is mapping index 2 = third audio stream).\n- The rest (regarding not re-encoding, container compatibility, etc.) is appropriately handled.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The model produces a command that would run, but it does not select the correct audio track as requested by the user.**  \n- The user asked for the second audio track (index 1).\n- The model selected index 2 (third audio track).\n\n**Per rubric:**\n> The eval should pass if:\n> - produces a valid and runable ffmpeg command (to your knowledge), with no invalid flags or parameters\n> - the produced ffmpeg command follows user request, as much as a valid command can follow the user request\n\nBecause the stream mapping does not follow the user request (**selects the wrong audio track**), **the eval should fail**."
