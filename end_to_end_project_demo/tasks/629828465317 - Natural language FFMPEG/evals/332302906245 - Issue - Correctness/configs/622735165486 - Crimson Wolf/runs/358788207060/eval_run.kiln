  "input": "I want to merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 of my input file multi_track.mp4 into a single output file",
  "output": "To merge specific streams from a multi-track file, you'll use the `-map` parameter to select which streams to include in the output. This allows you to pick specific video and audio tracks from files with multiple streams.\n\nThe `-map` parameter uses zero-based indexing, so stream 2 is the third stream and stream 7 is the eighth stream in the file. The format is `-map input_file_index:stream_index`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command maps stream 2 (video) and stream 7 (audio) from the input file, using `-c copy` to avoid re-encoding for faster processing while maintaining quality.",

    "chain_of_thought": "Let me evaluate the model's output step by step:\n\n1) **Does the model's output contain the issue described (incorrect ffmpeg command)?**\n\nLet me analyze the generated command:\n```bash\nffmpeg -i multi_track.mp4 -map 0:2 -map 0:7 -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nBreaking this down:\n- `-i multi_track.mp4`: Correctly specifies the input file\n- `-map 0:2`: Correctly maps stream 2 from input file 0 (first input file)\n- `-map 0:7`: Correctly maps stream 7 from input file 0 (first input file)\n- `-c copy`: Correctly uses stream copy to avoid re-encoding\n- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file\n\nThis command syntax is correct and will work as intended.\n\n2) **Is the model's output similar to the failure example?**\n\nThe failure example shows a command with:\n- Wrong parameter (`-I` instead of `-i`)\n- Non-existent preset (`extra_fast` instead of valid presets like `fast`, `slow`, etc.)\n\nThe model's output doesn't contain these types of errors:\n- Uses correct parameter names (`-i`, `-map`, `-c`)\n- Uses valid values (`copy` is a valid codec option)\n- Follows proper ffmpeg syntax\n\n3) **Does the model's output contain the issue?**\n\nNo, the model's output does not contain the issue. The ffmpeg command is syntactically correct and will successfully merge video from stream 2 and audio from stream 7 as requested by the user. The explanation is also accurate regarding zero-based indexing and the `-map` parameter usage.\n\n**Conclusion: PASS** - The model generated a correct, working ffmpeg command that matches the user's requirements."
