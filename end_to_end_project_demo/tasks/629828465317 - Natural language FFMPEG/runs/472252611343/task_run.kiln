    "output": "To place a raw DV file into an MP4 container without re-encoding, you need to perform a stream copy. This means the video and audio streams are not re-encoded but just repackaged. However, note that raw DV is often stored in AVI or MOV containers, and some players might have limited support for DV video streams inside MP4 containers. Still, ffmpeg can do the remux using the `-c copy` option to avoid re-encoding.\n\n- `-c copy` copies all streams as-is.\n- Input file is assumed to be named `input.dv` (adjust accordingly).\n- Output file is `output.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.dv -c copy -f mp4 output.mp4\n```\n\nIf the container or codec compatibility causes issues, be aware that remuxing raw DV into MP4 may not be broadly supported by all players, but this is the direct, lossless approach.",
