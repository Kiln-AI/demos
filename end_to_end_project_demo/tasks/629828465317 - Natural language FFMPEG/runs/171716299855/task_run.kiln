    "output": "To extract all audio tracks from input.mkv, merge them into a single audio stream, and save as an MP3 file, you can use ffmpeg's `amerge` filter. This filter combines multiple audio inputs into one multi-channel stream, then you can downmix to stereo if needed.\n\nImportant points:\n- We first map all audio streams as inputs.\n- Use `-filter_complex` with `amerge=inputs=N` where N is the number of audio streams.\n- Use `pan` filter to downmix to stereo if you want a stereo MP3, because MP3 commonly supports up to 2 channels.\n- Use `-ac 2` to set output channels to stereo.\n- Encode with libmp3lame codec for wide MP3 compatibility.\n- Assumption: input has more than one audio stream and you want all audio merged into one stereo track.\n\nExample command (assuming input has 2 audio streams, adjust for more by adding -map and changing N):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex \"[0:a:0][0:a:1]amerge=inputs=2,pan=stereo|c0<c0+c2|c1<c1+c3[aout]\" -map \"[aout]\" -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 4 merged.mp3\n```\n\nIf the number of audio streams is variable or more than 2, you'd need to adjust inputs and pan accordingly.\n\nFor a generic solution that merges all audio streams without explicitly specifying streams, you can do:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex \"amerge=inputs=$(ffprobe -v error -select_streams a -show_entries stream=index -of csv=p=0 input.mkv | wc -l),pan=stereo|c0<c0+c2+c4+c6|c1<c1+c3+c5+c7[aout]\" -map \"[aout]\" -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 4 merged.mp3\n```\n\nBut since shell variable expansion inside ffmpeg command is complex, it's better to manually specify.\n\nIf you want a simpler approach that concatenates audio tracks sequentially rather than mixing them, that would require a different approach such as using concat filter, but the request is to merge streams.\n\n# Final recommended command for 2 audio tracks merging into stereo MP3:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex \"[0:a:0][0:a:1]amerge=inputs=2,pan=stereo|c0<c0+c2|c1<c1+c3[aout]\" -map \"[aout]\" -ac 2 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 4 merged.mp3\n```",
