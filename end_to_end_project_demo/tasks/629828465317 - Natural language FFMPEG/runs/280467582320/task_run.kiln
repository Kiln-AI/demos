    "output": "To convert a video from 25fps to 24fps for a cinematic effect, you can use frame rate conversion with ffmpeg's -r option. For high quality, use the ProRes codec (for intermediate work or editing) or H.264 with a high bitrate (for delivery). ProRes is lossless-ish and widely used in professional workflows. For most users, ProRes is a good choice; if you need a smaller file, switch to H.264 with a low CRF.\n\nHere's how to convert and encode with ProRes:\n\n- -r 24 sets the output frame rate to 24fps.\n- -vf \"fps=24\" makes sure ffmpeg properly adjusts timing and handles dropped/duplicated frames smoothly.\n- -c:v prores_ks uses the high quality ProRes codec.\n- -profile:v 3 sets ProRes HQ for best quality.\n- -c:a copy copies the original audio without recompression.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"fps=24\" -c:v prores_ks -profile:v 3 -r 24 -c:a copy output.mov\n```\n\nIf file size is a concern and you're fine with H.264:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"fps=24\" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -pix_fmt yuv420p -r 24 -c:a aac -b:a 320k output.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- Input file is input.mp4.\n- Output is output.mov (ProRes) or output.mp4 (H.264).\n- Original audio is kept unchanged (\"copy\").\n- For full cinematic look, also consider adjusting motion blur (advanced), but standard frame rate conversion often suffices.",
