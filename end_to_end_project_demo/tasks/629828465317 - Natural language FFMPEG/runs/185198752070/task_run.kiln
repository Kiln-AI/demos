    "output": "To exclude attachments (such as fonts) from a Matroska (MKV) file while copying the video and audio streams without re-encoding, you can use stream selection to explicitly include only the video and audio streams. Attachments in MKV files are typically separate streams of type \"attachment\".\n\nUsing `-map 0:v` and `-map 0:a` selects all video and audio streams from the input (index 0). By not mapping attachment streams, you exclude them from the output. Using `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding, preserving quality and speeding up processing.\n\nThis approach provides a clean remux ignoring attachments.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0:v -map 0:a -c copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v` selects all video streams from input 0.\n- `-map 0:a` selects all audio streams from input 0.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n- Attachments are not mapped and thus excluded in the output.\n\nThis command assumes your input file contains at least one video and audio stream. If you want to verify streams prior to running, use `ffprobe input.mkv`.",
