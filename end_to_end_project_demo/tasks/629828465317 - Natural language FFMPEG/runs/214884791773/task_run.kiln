    "output": "If the video is truly hardsubbed, the subtitles are burned into the video image itself and cannot be extracted as a separate subtitle track. However, if the file contains embedded subtitle streams alongside the hardsubbed video, you can extract those subtitle streams.\n\nTo attempt to extract any embedded subtitles from `hardsubbed.mkv`, the best approach is to:\n\n- Use `ffmpeg -i` to inspect subtitle streams in the file.\n- Extract all subtitle streams present (often with codec types like `srt`, `ass`, `subrip`, `dvd_subtitle`, or `pgssub`).\n- Map subtitle streams to separate files or combine them if desired.\n\nBelow is a command that extracts all subtitle streams from `hardsubbed.mkv` as individual `.srt` files (assuming the embedded subtitles are text-based like SubRip or ASS). It uses stream specifiers to select subtitle streams and outputs each to separate files named `subtitle_trackN.srt`.\n\nNote: This command assumes text-based subtitles; if subtitles are bitmap-based (e.g., DVD subtitles), you might have to extract them in their native formats (`.sup`) or use OCR externally.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i hardsubbed.mkv -map 0:s -c:s srt subtitle_track_%d.srt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:s` selects all subtitle streams from the first input (`0`).\n- `-c:s srt` converts extracted subtitles to SubRip format (`.srt`).\n- `subtitle_track_%d.srt` outputs each subtitle stream to its own file numbered sequentially.\n\nIf there are no subtitle streams present, `ffmpeg` will report that no subtitle streams were found and no files will be created.\n\nIf you want to inspect the streams first and see what subtitles are available, use:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i hardsubbed.mkv\n```\n\nThis prints detailed stream info including subtitle streams.\n\nIn summary, extracting embedded subtitles from a hardsubbed video can be done only if the file contains soft subtitle tracks. Otherwise, subtitles are part of the video picture and cannot be extracted as text or subtitle streams with ffmpeg alone.",
