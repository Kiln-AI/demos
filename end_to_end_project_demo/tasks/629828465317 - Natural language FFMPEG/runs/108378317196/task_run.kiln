    "output": "To upscale a low-resolution video to 4K (3840x2160 pixels) for presentation purposes, you can use the ffmpeg scale filter with the Lanczos scaling algorithm, which generally provides good results for upscaling. Here are the key points:\n\n- -vf \"scale=3840:2160:flags=lanczos\" specifies the output resolution and selects the high-quality Lanczos filter for scaling.\n- -c:v libx264 encodes the video with the H.264 codec, suitable for high-resolution output.\n- -preset medium balances speed and quality; adjust as needed (e.g., slower for potentially higher quality).\n- -crf 18 is a good starting point for visually lossless or nearly visually lossless quality for presentations.\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p ensures compatibility with most playback devices/projectors.\n\nAssuming your input file is input.mp4 and you want to produce output_4k.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"scale=3840:2160:flags=lanczos\" -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_4k.mp4\n```\n\nThis command will create a 4K upscaled video suitable for presentations, prioritizing decent visual quality without excessive file size. Adjust -crf lower for higher quality if needed (e.g., 16), or higher for a smaller file.",
