    "output": "To convert an AAC audio file (audio.aac) to WAV format while preserving the original quality, you should use the pcm_s16le codec, which is standard uncompressed 16-bit PCM in little-endian and widely compatible. Since WAV is a lossless format and your source is likely lossy AAC, we decode without forcing any unnecessary resampling or transcoding, keeping the original sample rate and channel count.\n\n- -codec:a pcm_s16le specifies uncompressed PCM audio.\n- By default, ffmpeg preserves the sample rate and channel layout unless specified otherwise.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.aac -codec:a pcm_s16le audio.wav\n```\n\nThis command will give you a high-quality, uncompressed WAV file from your AAC source.",
