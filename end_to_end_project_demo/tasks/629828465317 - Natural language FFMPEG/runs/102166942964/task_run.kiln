    "output": "To merge two MP4 files that contain different language audio streams into a single MKV file with both audio streams preserved, without re-encoding, you can use stream copying (`-c copy`). This will just remux the streams, keeping original quality and encoding. The MKV container supports multiple audio tracks and various codecs typically found in MP4s.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The first MP4 file has video + audio in language A.\n- The second MP4 file has audio only in language B (or at least you want that audio).\n- You want to keep the original video from the first file and add the second file's audio track(s).\n- The codecs in both files are compatible with MKV (usually they are).\n\nThe command uses `-map` to specify which streams to include: video and audio from first file, audio only from second file.\n\nYou can also assign language metadata to the audio streams for better player support with `-metadata:s:a:X language=xyz`.\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg \\\n  -i input1.mp4 \\\n  -i input2.mp4 \\\n  -map 0:v \\\n  -map 0:a:0 \\\n  -map 1:a:0 \\\n  -c copy \\\n  -metadata:s:a:0 language=eng \\\n  -metadata:s:a:1 language=spa \\\n  output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:v` takes video from the first file.\n- `-map 0:a:0` takes the first audio stream from first file.\n- `-map 1:a:0` takes the first audio stream from second file.\n- `-c copy` copies all selected streams without re-encoding.\n- `-metadata:s:a:X` sets language code on audio streams (adjust as appropriate).\n- Result is MKV with video + two audio tracks.\n\nIf the second file contains multiple audio streams you want to add, add additional `-map` entries accordingly. If the first file contains subtitles or other streams you want to keep, add mappings similarly.\n\nThis approach efficiently merges without quality loss.",
