    "output": "To create a smooth, professional-looking video from a set of images with varying resolutions and aspect ratios, it's best to standardize the output resolution and handle aspect ratios with padding (to avoid stretching/distortion). For example, to generate a 1920x1080 (Full HD) video, you can use the `scale` filter along with `pad` to fit each image inside the frame, and then combine this with a separately supplied audio track.\n\nAssumptions:\n- Images are named in alphanumeric order (e.g., img001.jpg, img002.jpg) or your pattern matches.\n- Audio file is audio.mp3.\n- Desired output is output.mp4 (H.264 video, AAC audio).\n- 30 fps for smooth video; you can adjust -framerate or -r as needed.\n\nExplanation:\n- -framerate 30 sets input sequence to 30 fps.\n- -i \"img%03d.jpg\" uses a sequential pattern for image files. Adjust as needed.\n- The filter `scale=iw*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih):ih*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih)` ensures the image is as large as possible within 1920x1080 without cropping or stretching.\n- The filter `pad=1920:1080:(1920-iw*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih))/2:(1080-ih*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih))/2` centers the scaled image and fills the rest with black padding.\n- -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 for high-quality encoding, adjust as needed.\n- -c:a aac -b:a 192k encodes audio at good quality.\n- -shortest matches video length to audio or image sequence (whichever is shorter).\n- -pix_fmt yuv420p for compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -framerate 30 -i \"img%03d.jpg\" -i audio.mp3 \\\n-vf \"scale=iw*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih):ih*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih),pad=1920:1080:(1920-iw*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih))/2:(1080-ih*min(1920/iw\\,1080/ih))/2\" \\\n-c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a aac -b:a 192k -pix_fmt yuv420p -shortest output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command guarantees all images are displayed in a uniform resolution and aspect ratio, avoiding cropping or distortion, and synchronizes with the provided audio. Adjust image pattern, output resolution, framerate, or encoding settings as needed for your scenario.",
