    "output": "To normalize the audio in an MP4 file for consistent playback levels, you can use FFmpeg's `loudnorm` audio filter, which conforms to EBU R128 loudness standards. This ensures perceptually consistent loudness across different devices.\n\nHere's how this works:\n- The filter analyzes the audio to determine appropriate normalization values (two-pass is most accurate, but one-pass offers simplicity).\n- Uses `-c:v copy` to avoid re-encoding the video stream.\n- Audio is re-encoded (e.g., with AAC) to maintain MP4 compatibility.\n\nAssumptions:\n- You want a single-pass normalization for convenience and speed.\n- The output audio codec remains AAC for MP4 compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -af \"loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11\" -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k output_normalized.mp4\n```\n\n- `loudnorm=I=-16:TP=-1.5:LRA=11` specifies target integrated loudness, true peak, and loudness range.\n- `-c:v copy` preserves original video without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 192k` re-encodes audio at 192 kbps AAC.\n\nFor best results on diverse devices, the EBU R128 settings (`I=-16`, `TP=-1.5`) are commonly used industry standards. If you want the most accurate normalization, consider running a two-pass process; let me know if youâ€™d like that command.",
