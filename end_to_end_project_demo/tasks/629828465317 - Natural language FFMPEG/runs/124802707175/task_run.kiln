    "output": "To reduce noise in an audio file using ffmpeg, you can apply the `afftdn` filter, which performs frequency domain noise reduction. Setting `nr=15` applies approximately a 15 dB noise reduction.\n\n- The filter `afftdn=nr=15` targets general broadband noise reduction by suppressing noise by 15 dB.\n- This technique is most effective for steady, background noise rather than highly variable noise.\n- You can adjust `nr` for more or less aggressive noise suppression, but too much reduction may cause artifacts.\n\nHereâ€™s the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.wav -af afftdn=nr=15 output_denoised.wav\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n- The input file (`audio.wav`) is single-channel or simple stereo. For more advanced multi-channel setup, further settings may be needed.\n- Output is a WAV file to preserve quality, but you can choose any supported audio format.",
