    "output": "To downscale presentation.flv to standard 480p while preserving subtitles, you'll want to:\n\n- Use the video filter scale=-2:480, which sets the height to 480 pixels and automatically adjusts the width to maintain the aspect ratio. The width is set to -2 to ensure it is divisible by 2, a requirement for many codecs.\n- Copy the subtitle stream or re-encode subtitles if necessary to ensure they are preserved. If subtitles are in a separate stream (e.g., SRT or embedded), you can copy them with -c:s copy; if they are rendered as bitmap subtitles (like DVD or Blu-ray subs), more complex processing might be required.\n- Encode the video with a compatible codec like libx264 for good quality and compatibility.\n- Keep audio by copying or re-encoding as needed.\n- Output MP4 or MKV depending on subtitle support you need (MKV is better for embedded subtitle support).\n\nAssuming the subtitles are in a separate stream compatible with copy and you want an MKV output (which supports subtitles well):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i presentation.flv -vf scale=-2:480 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy -c:s copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-vf scale=-2:480`: Downscale video to height 480 preserving aspect ratio.\n- `-c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23`: Encode video with balanced quality/speed.\n- `-c:a copy`: Copy audio stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s copy`: Copy subtitles without re-encoding.\n- Output container `output.mkv` supports subtitles well.\n\nIf subtitles are not in a separate stream and are hardcoded, additional steps would be needed to burn them into the video using `-vf subtitles=filename.srt`. Let me know if thatâ€™s the case.",
