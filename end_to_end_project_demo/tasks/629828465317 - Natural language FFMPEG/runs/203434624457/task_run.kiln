    "output": "To normalize the audio volume across your video file, use FFmpeg's loudnorm filter, which implements EBU R128 loudness normalization. This filter adjusts the audio loudness to a broadcast standard, ensuring more consistent volume throughout playback.\n\nHere's how you can perform a single-pass normalization:\n\n- Use the loudnorm audio filter for normalization. By default, it targets -23 LUFS integrated loudness (can be adjusted).\n- -c:v copy copies the video stream without re-encoding, which is efficient for large files.\n- -c:a aac re-encodes the audio to AAC for compatibility, with a standard bitrate.\n\nAssumptions:\n- The original input is input.mp4 and you want to output to output.mp4.\n- For most efficient handling of large files, only the audio is processed.\n- You want single-pass normalization for simplicity and speed. For strict compliance, a two-pass process can be used (see note after the main command).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v copy -af loudnorm -c:a aac -b:a 192k output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you need even more accurate normalization (for example, when preparing files for broadcast or needing precise loudness values), you can use a two-pass loudnorm process. Let me know if you need the specific commands for that!",
