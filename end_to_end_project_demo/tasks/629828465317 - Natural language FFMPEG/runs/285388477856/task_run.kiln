    "output": "<think>\nOkay, the user just said \"long video\". That's pretty vague. I need to figure out what they want. Let me think. Maybe they mean a video that's long in duration, like a lengthy recording, and they might need to process it somehow. Common operations for long videos could be trimming, splitting, reducing size, or converting to a streamable format. Since they didn't specify, I should ask for more details.\n\nWait, the assistant's instructions say that if the input is incomplete or ambiguous, I should ask for clarification. So in this case, the user's message is too short and unclear. Possible clarifications needed: what specific transformation do they want? Are they looking to trim the video? Split it into parts? Convert it to a different format? Or something else like optimizing for streaming, changing resolution, etc.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the user wants to create a long video from multiple files? Or they have a long video and need help with processing. There are so many possibilities. Without more info, providing a correct ffmpeg command is impossible. So the right approach here is to ask the user to provide more details about the desired transformation. Let them know that the current query is too vague and list possible areas they could clarify, like trimming, splitting, conversion, or optimization.\n</think>\n\nThe input is too vague. Please clarify what you'd like to do with the long video. For example:\n- Trim/split the video\n- Convert to a different format\n- Reduce file size for streaming/storage\n- Apply a specific filter/codec\n- Adjust resolution/frame rate\n\nWould one of these apply?",
