    "output": "To convert your old video.mpg file into an AVI container format, you can use ffmpeg to copy the streams if the codecs are compatible or re-encode them if not. Since MPG may contain MPEG-2 video and MP2 audio which are supported inside AVI as well, copying streams is possible. However, if compatibility is an issue, re-encoding to more widely supported codecs like MPEG-4 part 2 (via `mpeg4` encoder) and MP3 or AAC audio in AVI would be more reliable.\n\nHereâ€™s a basic command that re-encodes the video to MPEG-4 video and MP3 audio inside AVI:\n\n- `-c:v mpeg4` specifies MPEG-4 video codec.\n- `-q:v 5` sets video quality; lower values give better quality (1-31).\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` encodes audio as MP3.\n- `-q:a 5` sets audio quality for MP3 (variable bitrate).\n- AVI container is set by the `.avi` extension.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mpg -c:v mpeg4 -q:v 5 -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 5 output.avi\n```\n\nIf your original streams are already compatible and you want to avoid re-encoding (faster and lossless), try stream copy:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mpg -c copy output.avi\n```\n\nNote that stream copy may fail or the output AVI might not play correctly if codecs are not supported inside AVI container. In those cases, re-encoding as above is recommended.",
