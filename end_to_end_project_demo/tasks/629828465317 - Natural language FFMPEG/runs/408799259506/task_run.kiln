    "output": "To efficiently merge a silent video file (video.mp4) with an audio file (audio.mp3) of the same length, you can use ffmpeg’s stream copy (`-c copy`), which avoids re-encoding and allows fast, lossless muxing—perfect for large files. If you want ffmpeg to automatically trim or pad as needed, you can add the `-shortest` flag to ensure the output stops at the end of the shortest stream (in this case, since they’re the same length, this ensures tight sync and fast processing).\n\nHere's the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.mp3 -c copy -map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0 -shortest merged_output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- `-i video.mp4` and `-i audio.mp3`: input video and audio files.\n- `-c copy`: copies streams directly, avoiding re-encoding (great for large files).\n- `-map 0:v:0 -map 1:a:0`: selects the first video stream from video.mp4 and the first audio stream from audio.mp3.\n- `-shortest`: output ends when the shortest stream ends, preventing unwanted extra duration.\n- `merged_output.mp4`: output file.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Both files are of equal length, so `-shortest` serves mainly as a safeguard.\n- video.mp4 and audio.mp3 are compatible with MP4 container (most common codecs: H.264 video, MP3 audio). If not, re-encoding may be needed.\n\n**Best Practice for Large Files:**  \nStream copying (`-c copy`) is the fastest and most efficient way to merge large files, minimizing CPU and IO usage.",
