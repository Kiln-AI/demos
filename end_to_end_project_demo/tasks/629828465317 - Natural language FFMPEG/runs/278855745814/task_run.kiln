    "output": "To remove background noise from audio.mp3 and convert it to a mix-ready WAV file, you can use FFmpegâ€™s built-in audio denoising filter afftdn, then export to 24-bit WAV for higher quality.\n\n- The afftdn filter is designed for broad noise reduction (e.g., hum, hiss). The nr option controls the noise reduction amount (more aggressive at higher values).\n- ar 48000 and sample_fmt s24 set the output WAV file to 48kHz, 24-bit, which is standard for mixing and professional workflows.\n- The default afftdn mode (m=rn) is good for general noise.\n- If your noise is narrow-band (like hum), you could adjust afftdn settings, but for general noise removal, this works well.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i audio.mp3 -af \"afftdn=nf=-25\" -ar 48000 -sample_fmt s24 output.wav\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- Your background noise is general (not a strict narrow-band hum).\n- You want the output in 48kHz, 24-bit WAV format (adjust if your DAW has different requirements).\n- If you want more or less noise reduction, adjust the nf value (e.g., nf=-15 for lighter, nf=-35 for stronger).",
