    "output": "To trim off the first 5 seconds of a video while keeping the rest as an exact copy without re-encoding (for lossless and fast processing), you can use the `-ss` option as an input seeking parameter combined with `-c copy` to copy streams directly.\n\n- Using `-ss 5` before `-i` can be less accurate but faster; however, since you want an exact copy starting at 5 seconds, place `-ss 5` after `-i` for accurate seeking.\n- `-c copy` copies the audio and video without re-encoding.\n- Note: For some formats, cutting without re-encoding might result in slightly imprecise cuts unless keyframes align with the trim point. If precise frame-accurate trimming is necessary, re-encoding may be required.\n\nHere's the command assuming a file called `input.mp4` and trimming the first 5 seconds off:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -ss 5 -c copy output_trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nIf you find the cut is not frame-accurate and want exact trimming with re-encoding, you can re-encode as follows (this is slower but precise):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 5 -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -preset fast -crf 23 output_trimmed.mp4\n```\n\nThis re-encodes the video and audio starting precisely at 5 seconds.",
