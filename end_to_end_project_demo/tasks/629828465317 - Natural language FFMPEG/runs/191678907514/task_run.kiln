    "output": "Yes, it is possible to combine (concatenate) two video files in sequence without re-encoding by using stream copy, but it requires that both input files have exactly the same codec, codec parameters (resolution, framerate, pixel format), and container format for seamless concatenation.\n\nThere are two common methods depending on the container format:\n\n1. **For formats like MP4 or MOV** (or other container formats that support it), you can use the concat demuxer with a text file listing the inputs. This does stream copy without re-encoding.\n\n2. **For MPEG-TS (.ts) files**, you can concatenate the files with a simple file concat (e.g., with `cat file1.ts file2.ts > combined.ts`) since the format supports this natively, then use ffmpeg to remux or convert.\n\nAssuming you have two MP4 files with matching codecs and parameters:\n\n- Create a text file `inputs.txt` with the following content:\n  ```\n  file 'input1.mp4'\n  file 'input2.mp4'\n  ```\n- Use the concat demuxer with `-safe 0` to allow file paths:\n- Use `-c copy` for stream copy (no re-encoding).\n\nExample command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i inputs.txt -c copy output.mp4\n```\n\nThis will concatenate the input MP4 files perfectly as long as their codec and encoding parameters match.\n\n**Summary of key points:**\n\n- Use the concat demuxer method with a file list for stream copy concatenation.\n- Input files must be encoded with the same codecs and settings.\n- No re-encoding means the process is fast and lossless but requires compatible inputs.\n\nIf your files are not compatible, you'll need to re-encode or preprocess to align parameters before concatenation.",
