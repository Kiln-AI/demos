    "output": "To remove vocals from a stereo audio track like an MP3, a common technique is to use the \"vocal removal\" method by applying the `pan` and `stereotools` audio filters. This works by subtracting the center-panned components (usually vocals) from the left and right channels, leaving mostly the instrumental parts.\n\nIn ffmpeg, the `-af \"stereotools=mlev=1.0\"` filter is a more nuanced method, but a classic approach is using the `pan` filter with a stereo formula like `c0=c0-c1` and `c1=c1-c0` to reduce center content.\n\nHowever, a more straightforward way is to use the `-af \"pan=stereo|c0=0.5*c0-0.5*c1|c1=0.5*c1-0.5*c0\"` filter, which subtracts the difference of left and right channels.\n\nKeep in mind that vocal removal is not perfect and depends on the vocal mixing (center panned vocals yield better results).\n\nHere is a command that attempts vocal removal by applying this method:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i song.mp3 -af \"pan=stereo|c0=0.5*c0-0.5*c1|c1=0.5*c1-0.5*c0\" -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 192k instrumental.mp3\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-af \"pan=stereo|c0=0.5*c0-0.5*c1|c1=0.5*c1-0.5*c0\"` subtracts the left and right channels to reduce center-panned vocals.\n- `-c:a libmp3lame` specifies encoding with the MP3 codec.\n- `-b:a 192k` sets the audio bitrate to 192 kbps for good quality.\n\nIf your source is mono or has vocals not strictly in the center, this method might not work well, and more advanced source separation tools (like AI-based) would be required.",
