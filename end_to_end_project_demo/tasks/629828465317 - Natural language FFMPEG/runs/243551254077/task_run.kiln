    "output": "To convert an MKV video to use the H.264 codec and reduce its resolution by 50%, you can use the following technique:\n\n- -c:v libx264 selects the popular and efficient H.264 codec, commonly used for high compatibility and streaming.\n- -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 halves both the width (iw) and height (ih) of the input video.\n- -c:a copy copies the original audio stream without re-encoding (useful if the audio is already in a compatible format).\n\nIf you want to ensure the output is widely compatible (e.g., for browser playback), you might also add -pix_fmt yuv420p and convert to MP4 container. Here, I’ll maintain MKV as the output, assuming you prefer to keep it (you can set output.mp4 to change container).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\n- -crf 23 sets the output quality (lower means higher quality, 18–28 is typical; 23 is a good default).\n- -preset medium controls encoding speed vs. compression efficiency. Choose fast, slow, or other presets for your needs.\n\nAssumptions made:\n- Your input video is named input.mkv.\n- Audio codec is compatible with MKV; if not, consider also re-encoding audio (e.g., -c:a aac).\n- Output in MKV is acceptable—change the extension to .mp4 if you prefer MP4.\n\nThis will efficiently downscale and transcode your video to H.264.",
