    "output": "To convert an MKV file to a smaller-sized MP4 using VP9 (an efficient, modern video codec often providing better compression than H.264), you will:\n\n- Use libvpx-vp9 as the video codec.\n- Set the output container to MP4.\n- Use a CRF (Constant Rate Factor) value for quality-based compression (lower CRF = higher quality/bigger file; higher CRF = lower quality/smaller file; 30 is a good starting point for VP9).\n- Re-encode audio to AAC for MP4 compatibility.\n- Include threads for faster encoding.\n\n**Assumptions:** Input file is called `input.mkv`, output will be `output.mp4`, and quality is more important than absolute smallest file size (for largest size reduction, increase CRF, e.g., 35).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -c:v libvpx-vp9 -b:v 0 -crf 30 -threads 4 -c:a aac -b:a 128k output.mp4\n```\n\n**Explanation of key parameters:**\n\n- `-c:v libvpx-vp9`: Use VP9 video codec (efficient compression).\n- `-b:v 0 -crf 30`: Quality-based variable bitrate encoding (adjust CRF for quality vs size trade-off).\n- `-threads 4`: Use 4 threads (adjust based on CPU).\n- `-c:a aac -b:a 128k`: Encode audio to AAC at 128 kbps (widely compatible with MP4).\n  \n**Note:**\n- VP9 in MP4 is less common than in WebM, but most modern players support it.\n- Change `crf` to a higher value (33–40) for a much smaller file at the cost of quality, or lower (25–29) for better quality.",
