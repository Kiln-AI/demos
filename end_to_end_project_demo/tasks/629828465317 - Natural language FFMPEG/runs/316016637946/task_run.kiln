    "output": "To extract closed captions from a broadcast MPEG-2 transport stream (often embedded as EIA-608/708 captions in the video stream), you can use ffmpeg's `-c:s mov_text` or `-c:s srt` if your input has subtitle streams. Most broadcast streams carry captions as a separate subtitle stream or embedded in the video stream.\n\nAssuming the captions are present in the transport stream as a subtitle stream, you can map the subtitle stream and convert it to an SRT file. If the CC are embedded in the video, ffmpeg supports extraction using bitstream filters like `cc_extract`.\n\nA common approach:\n\n- Use `-map` to select the subtitle stream (you may need to identify the correct stream index).\n- Use `-c:s srt` to convert to SRT subtitles.\n- Output an `.srt` file.\n\nFirst, you may want to probe the file to identify the subtitle stream:\n\n```bash\nffprobe -hide_banner -show_streams input.ts\n```\n\nLook for streams with `codec_type=subtitle` or video streams with `side_data_list` mentioning \"Closed Captions\".\n\nIf there is no explicit subtitle stream, but captions are embedded in video, use the `cc_extract` bitstream filter:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ts -f srt -map 0:v:0 -c:s srt -bsf:v cc_extract output.srt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-map 0:v:0` selects the first video stream from input 0 (the transport stream).\n- `-bsf:v cc_extract` applies the closed captions extractor bitstream filter on the video stream.\n- `-c:s srt` encodes the subtitles to SRT format.\n- `-f srt` forces the output container to be SRT subtitle format.\n- Output is a standalone SRT file with the extracted captions.\n\nMake sure your ffmpeg build supports `cc_extract`. If not, use the subtitles stream extraction approach instead.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ts -map 0:v:0 -c:s srt -bsf:v cc_extract output.srt\n```",
