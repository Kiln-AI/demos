    "output": "To convert video.mp4 to MKV and burn subtitles from an external .srt subtitle file, you'll want to use the `subtitles` filter which renders the text directly into the video frames (hardcoding them).\n\nKey points in the command:\n- `-i video.mp4` is your input video.\n- The `-vf subtitles=subtitle.srt` applies the subtitles filter, hardcoding them into the video.\n- Use a high-quality video codec like libx264 for broad compatibility.\n- Keep the audio stream as is (copy) or re-encode if necessary; here, audio is copied to preserve quality.\n- Output format MKV is set by the output extension `.mkv`.\n- The subtitles are permanently burned in, so the MKV file won't have separate subtitle streams.\n\nAssumption: The subtitle file is named `subtitle.srt` and is in the same directory.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vf subtitles=subtitle.srt -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-crf 23` balances quality and file size (lower is better quality).\n- `-preset medium` balances encoding speed and compression.\n- `-c:a copy` avoids re-encoding audio to keep it lossless and faster.\n\nIf your subtitle filename or path has spaces or special characters, wrap it in single quotes and escape special characters as needed.",
