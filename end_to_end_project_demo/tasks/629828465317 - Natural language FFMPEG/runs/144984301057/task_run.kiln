    "output": "To efficiently down-sample a large image (4000x3000.png) to a smaller, more manageable size (800x600.jpeg) while maintaining quality:\n\n- Use the scale filter to set the new resolution.\n- Specify the -q:v 2 option for high JPEG quality (1 is best, 31 is lowest; 2 is a good, visually lossless choice).\n- Employ the lanczos filter in -vf scale for best downscaling quality.\n- Output as JPEG.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i 4000x3000.png -vf \"scale=800:600:flags=lanczos\" -q:v 2 800x600.jpeg\n```\n\nAssumptions:  \n- Output dimensions are exactly 800x600; the aspect ratio matches the input (both 4:3).\n- If your original image had a different aspect ratio, you would need to decide to crop/pad or allow distortion.\n- -q:v 2 keeps JPEG compression very light to retain visible quality.\n- Using lanczos scaling filter helps maintain image sharpness on down-sizing, which is particularly important for large images.",
