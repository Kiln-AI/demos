    "output": "Yes, you can reduce the video dimensions by half using the scale filter, while maintaining as much quality as possible by using a high-quality encoder with a suitable CRF (Constant Rate Factor). This compresses efficiently without excessive quality loss. Hereâ€™s how:\n\n- The scale=iw/2:ih/2 filter halves both width and height.\n- libx264 is a high-quality H.264 video encoder.\n- crf 18 achieves visually lossless or very high quality (lower number = higher quality).\n- preset slower improves compression efficiency at the cost of speed (use \"veryslow\" for even better compression).\n- -c:a copy copies the audio without re-encoding (since that's not requested).\n- pix_fmt yuv420p ensures broader compatibility.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i clip.mov -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset slow -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output_halfsize.mp4\n```\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- You want to halve both width and height (total pixel area reduces by 75%).\n- Source audio does not need to be modified.\n- Output as MP4 for broader compatibility; you can adjust the extension if needed.\n",
