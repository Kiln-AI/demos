    "output": "To extract subtitle timings and text from a video like presentation.mkv into a plain text CSV, you can use ffmpeg to first dump the subtitles into a standard subtitle format (e.g., SRT), then process that to convert it into CSV.\n\nHowever, ffmpeg alone cannot directly export subtitles as CSV; it can extract subtitles as a subtitle file (SRT or ASS). Then, you can parse the subtitles file into CSV using scripting or specialized tools.\n\nAssuming you want a simple CSV with columns: start_time, end_time, text, here’s a two-step approach:\n\n1. Extract subtitles from the MKV to a SubRip (.srt) file using ffmpeg.\n2. Convert the .srt to CSV using a minimal Python script or a known tool (not shown here).\n\nBelow is how to extract the subtitles from presentation.mkv assuming you want all subtitle streams or just the first subtitle stream (usually 0:s:0):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i presentation.mkv -map 0:s:0 subtitles.srt\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-map 0:s:0` selects the first subtitle stream from the input.\n- `subtitles.srt` will contain the subtitles in SRT format with start/end times and text.\n\nIf you need all subtitle streams extracted separately, you could adjust `-map` accordingly.\n\nIf the original subtitles are in a format ffmpeg can’t export as SRT, you might consider using `ffmpeg` with `-c:s srt` codec to convert subtitles to SRT.\n\nIf you want, here is a command that attempts to do that conversion explicitly:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i presentation.mkv -map 0:s:0 -c:s srt subtitles.srt\n```\n\nTo summarize, exporting subtitle timings and texts to CSV using only ffmpeg directly is not possible, but extracting a clean SRT is the best first step.\n\nIf you want, I can help by providing a sample Python script to convert the SRT contents to CSV format.
