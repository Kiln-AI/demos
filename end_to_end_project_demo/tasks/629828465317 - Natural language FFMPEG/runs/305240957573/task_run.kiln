    "output": "To remove (strip) all audio streams from a video file, you can use the -an flag, which tells ffmpeg to disable audio in the output. The -c:v copy option is used to copy the video stream without re-encoding, ensuring there is no loss in video quality and that the process is very fast. This is ideal when you simply want to remove audio and keep the rest unchanged.\n\nAssumption: clip.mkv contains a single video stream and one or more audio streams. The output will have identical video data and no audio streams.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i clip.mkv -c:v copy -an output_noaudio.mkv\n```\n\nThis will produce output_noaudio.mkv containing only the video with all audio removed.",
