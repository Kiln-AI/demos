    "output": "To batch extract cover art from all MP3 files in a directory, you can use a shell loop that runs an `ffmpeg` command on each file. The cover art is usually stored as an attached picture (often the first video stream in the file). We will extract that stream as an image.\n\nKey points:\n- `-an` disables audio output; we only want the cover art.\n- `-vcodec copy` copies the cover art stream without re-encoding.\n- We will name the output image based on the input filename (e.g., `song.mp3` â†’ `song.jpg`).\n- If the MP3 has no attached picture stream, ffmpeg returns an error, so suppress errors or handle them gracefully.\n- Use a common image extension like `.jpg` since most cover art are JPEG images.\n- This assumes a Unix-like shell (Linux/macOS). For Windows, batch scripting is similar but different syntax.\n\nExample bash script:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n  # Extract embedded cover art (usually stream 0:v:0)\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -an -vcodec copy \"${f%.mp3}.jpg\" 2>/dev/null\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The loop iterates over all `.mp3` files in the current folder.\n- `\"${f%.mp3}.jpg\"` strips `.mp3` and adds `.jpg`.\n- Redirect stderr to /dev/null to ignore errors when no cover art is present.\n\nIf you want to be more verbose or handle errors differently, you can add checks for successful extraction or output logs.\n\nThis approach efficiently batch extracts cover art with best practices focusing on stream copying to avoid re-encoding and naming files logically.\n\n---\n\nIf you want the explicit command line for one file before batching:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp3 -an -vcodec copy cover.jpg\n```\n\nWhich you then wrap in the loop above for batch processing.",
