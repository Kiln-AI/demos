    "output": "To brighten a video in FFmpeg, you can use the eq (equalizer) video filter, which allows you to adjust brightness and contrast. A typical value to noticeably brighten footage without washing it out is brightness=0.1 (where 0 is none, 1 is very bright). You can tweak this value as needed.\n\nHere’s how to do it:\n\n- -vf eq=brightness=0.1 increases the brightness by 0.1.\n- Output remains in AVI format, matching the input.\n- No re-encoding parameters specified: this will use FFmpeg’s defaults for codec and quality; adjust as needed for your workflow.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.avi -vf eq=brightness=0.1 output.avi\n```\n\nIf you want to fine-tune the effect, you can adjust the brightness value (range: -1.0 to 1.0) and consider tweaking contrast as well (e.g., eq=brightness=0.1:contrast=1.1 for a slight contrast increase).",
