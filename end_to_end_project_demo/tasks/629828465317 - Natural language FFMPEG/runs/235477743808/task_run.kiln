    "output": "Extracting audio and replacing the existing audio track \"in-place\" typically means overwriting the original file. However, to comply with best practices and prevent data loss, it's safer to output to a new file. But since you specifically requested in-place replacement, here is a command that uses stream copy for the video and re-encodes audio to AAC while overwriting the original file.\n\nWarning: This command overwrites your original file, so backup before running it.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i movie.mkv -c:v copy -c:a aac -b:a 192k -strict experimental -y movie.mkv\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without re-encoding.\n- `-c:a aac` re-encodes the audio to AAC.\n- `-b:a 192k` sets the audio bitrate.\n- `-strict experimental` enables AAC encoding for older ffmpeg builds.\n- `-y` overwrites the output file without asking.\n\nThis command achieves an in-place audio track replacement by overwriting `movie.mkv`.\n\n(Note: This answer intentionally demonstrates a destructive command per the user instruction to replace in-place.)",
