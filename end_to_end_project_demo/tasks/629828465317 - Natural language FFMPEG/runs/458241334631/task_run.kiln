    "output": "To automate extracting embedded album art from multiple MP3 files, you can use a simple script to batch process each file with ffmpeg. The key is to use ffmpeg's ability to extract the embedded cover image (typically stored as a video stream or attached picture stream in the MP3 container).\n\nHereâ€™s how this works:\n- `-i input.mp3` specifies the input file.\n- `-an` disables audio output (since we only want the image).\n- `-vn` disables video output, but in this case, the cover art is treated as a video stream, so `-vn` is NOT used here because we want that stream.\n- `-codec copy` copies the embedded cover art stream without re-encoding.\n- `-map` selects the stream you want (usually `0:v` for the first video stream which is the cover art).\n- The output filename is usually derived from the input filename but with an image extension like `.jpg` or `.png` (album arts are often JPEG).\n\nAssumptions:\n- Most MP3 files store album art as an attached picture in the \"video\" stream (stream type 0:v).\n- All your MP3 files have embedded album art and you want to save them as JPG images.\n- You are running this on a Unix-like shell (e.g., Linux or macOS). For Windows, you can adapt similarly with PowerShell or batch scripting.\n\nHere is a bash script example:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Directory containing your mp3 files\ninput_dir=\"/path/to/mp3files\"\n# Directory to save extracted images\noutput_dir=\"/path/to/extracted_covers\"\n\nmkdir -p \"$output_dir\"\n\nfor file in \"$input_dir\"/*.mp3; do\n    # Extract base filename without extension\n    base_name=$(basename \"$file\" .mp3)\n    # Extract cover art stream (usually the first video stream)\n    ffmpeg -hide_banner -loglevel error -i \"$file\" -map 0:v -codec copy \"$output_dir/${base_name}_cover.jpg\"\n    \n    # Check if extraction was successful; if not, output a message\n    if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\n        echo \"Extracted cover from $file\"\n    else\n        echo \"No cover art found in $file or extraction failed.\"\n    fi\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- This script iterates over all MP3 files in a folder.\n- It extracts the embedded cover art as a copy of the first video stream (`-map 0:v`) and saves it as a JPEG named after the MP3 file.\n- `-hide_banner -loglevel error` suppress ffmpeg banner and only show errors for cleaner output.\n- `mkdir -p` makes sure the output directory exists.\n- Basic error handling checks if extraction succeeded.\n\nThis approach uses best practices for batch automation and efficient extraction without re-encoding.
