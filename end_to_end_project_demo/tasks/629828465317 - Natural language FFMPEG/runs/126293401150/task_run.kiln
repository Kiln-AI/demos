    "output": "To remux a .ts file into an .mp4 container while copying video and audio streams without re-encoding, and excluding closed caption (subtitle) streams, you can use stream copy mode (`-c copy`) and selectively map only the video and audio streams. Closed captions are typically carried in separate subtitle streams, so excluding subtitle streams will remove them.\n\nKey points:\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n- Use `-map` to include only video and audio streams.\n- `-map 0:v` selects all video streams.\n- `-map 0:a` selects all audio streams.\n- Closed captions are often in subtitle streams (`0:s`), so skipping `-map 0:s` removes them.\n- MP4 container supports video and audio streams but has limited support for many subtitle formats, so excluding subtitles ensures compatibility.\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes MP4 for streaming by moving metadata to the start.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.ts -map 0:v -map 0:a -c copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis command assumes:\n- Input streams are properly labeled (video, audio, subtitles).\n- Closed captions are within subtitle streams (most common case).\n- You want all video and audio streams copied as-is into an MP4 container.",
