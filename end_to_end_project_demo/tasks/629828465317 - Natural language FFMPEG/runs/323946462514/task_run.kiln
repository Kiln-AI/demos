    "output": "To convert a stereo WAV file to a mono MP3 with reduced bitrate for podcasting, you need to:\n\n- Downmix the audio from stereo to mono using `-ac 1`.\n- Set a lower bitrate for MP3 to reduce file size and bandwidth, typically 64k to 96k is good for spoken word.\n- Use the libmp3lame encoder (`-c:a libmp3lame`) which is widely supported and effective for MP3 encoding.\n- Optionally, you can add `-ar 44100` to set the sample rate to 44.1 kHz, a common rate for podcasts.\n\nHere's the command assuming input.wav as your source and output.mp3 as the target:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.wav -ac 1 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 64k -ar 44100 output.mp3\n```\n\nThis command downsamples to mono, encodes to MP3 with 64 kbps bitrate, and sets the sample rate to 44.1 kHz, creating a file suitable for podcasting with reduced size and clear voice quality. Adjust bitrate as needed for your quality/size balance.",
