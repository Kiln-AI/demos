    "output": "To convert a collection of .ts MPEG-2 files into MKV containers without re-encoding (just stream copying), you can use ffmpeg's stream copy feature (-c copy). This will remux the audio and video streams directly into MKV files, preserving the original quality and minimizing processing time.\n\nAssuming you want to convert each .ts file individually into a corresponding .mkv file, you can write a loop in a shell environment (Bash shown here) that applies ffmpeg stream copy to each file:\n\n- `-c copy` ensures no re-encoding, just remuxing streams.\n- MKV supports many codecs including MPEG-2 video, making it suitable as an output container.\n- This avoids any quality loss or long encoding times.\n\nExample script for Linux/macOS Bash:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.ts; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c copy \"${f%.ts}.mkv\"\ndone\n```\n\nIf you want to merge all `.ts` files into a single MKV file without re-encoding, you need a different approach using a concat demuxer input file, but as per your request for collection conversion, this per-file remuxing is the straightforward method.",
