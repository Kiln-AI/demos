    "output": "To downscale a 3840x2160 (4K) video to 1920x1080 (Full HD) with maximum sharpness, you should use a high-quality scaling algorithm such as 'lanczos', which excels in preserving detail and sharpness during resizing.\n\nKey points:\n- Use the `-vf scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos` video filter to resize the video with the lanczos rescaling algorithm.\n- Preserve the aspect ratio by specifying exact dimensions assuming the input is exactly 3840x2160.\n- Use a high-quality encoder preset to maintain quality.\n- For video codec, libx264 with a reasonable CRF value balances quality and file size.\n- Keep the pixel format as yuv420p for broad compatibility.\n- For audio stream, copy it as-is to avoid quality loss and speeding up processing (optional).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 18 -c:a copy -pix_fmt yuv420p output_1080p.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `scale=1920:1080:flags=lanczos`: scales the video to 1080p using the sharp lanczos rescaling filter.\n- `-c:v libx264`: encodes the video with the widely supported H.264 codec.\n- `-preset slow`: favors compression efficiency and quality over speed.\n- `-crf 18`: high-quality constant rate factor (lower means better quality; 18 is visually lossless or near).\n- `-c:a copy`: copies the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve original quality and save time.\n- `-pix_fmt yuv420p`: ensures compatibility across devices and players.\n\nThis command assumes your source is in MP4 format, and you want to maintain original audio quality and codec compatibility. Adjust input/output filenames and audio options depending on your requirements.",
