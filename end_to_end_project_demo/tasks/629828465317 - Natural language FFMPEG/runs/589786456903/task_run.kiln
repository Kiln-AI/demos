    "output": "To quickly split each video in a folder into 10-second segments while maintaining the original quality and avoiding re-encoding (which can be time-consuming), you can use ffmpeg's segment muxer with stream copy mode (`-c copy`). This will cut the video into chunks by keyframes, which is very fast but might have segments slightly longer/shorter if keyframes don't align exactly at 10s intervals.\n\n**Key points:**\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding (fastest).\n- `-f segment` uses segment muxer to split the video.\n- `-segment_time 10` sets segment length to 10 seconds.\n- Output filenames include `%03d` to number segments sequentially.\n- Make sure your files have keyframes placed frequently (e.g., GOP size ~10s) for precise splitting; otherwise, splits occur at nearest previous keyframe.\n\nFor batch processing, a shell script (bash) loops over all video files in a directory and runs this command per file.\n\n---\n\nExample bash script snippet for `.mp4` videos:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nmkdir -p output_segments\nfor input in *.mp4; do\n  filename=\"${input%.*}\"\n  ffmpeg -i \"$input\" -c copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_time 10 -reset_timestamps 1 \"output_segments/${filename}_part_%03d.mp4\"\ndone\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- `mkdir -p output_segments` creates an output subfolder to keep outputs organized.\n- `${input%.*}` extracts the base filename without extension.\n- `-map 0` ensures all streams (audio, video, subtitles) are copied.\n- `-reset_timestamps 1` resets timestamps on each segment to start at 0, improving compatibility.\n- Output files named like `filename_part_000.mp4`, etc.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n\n- Your videos are `.mp4` format; modify `*.mp4` accordingly if you have other extensions.\n- You want lossless speed-focused splitting, not frame-accurate re-encoded segments.\n- Running on a Unix-like shell (Linux, macOS); adjust for Windows PowerShell or batch if needed.\n\nThis is the fastest and efficient way to split many videos into 10-second chunks.\n\n---\n\nIf you want me to generate commands for other systems or with re-encoding, just ask!",
