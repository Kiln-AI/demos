    "output": "To optimize a large WAV audio file (concert_audio.wav) for web streaming and reduce file size while preserving good quality, it's best to convert it to the AAC codec in an MP4 or M4A container. AAC is highly efficient and widely supported on the web.\n\nHere are the steps and ffmpeg command explained:\n\n- -c:a aac encodes audio using the AAC codec, suitable for web and streaming.\n- -b:a 128k sets the audio bitrate to 128 kbps, balancing quality and file size (you can adjust higher for even better quality, e.g., 192k).\n- -movflags +faststart places important metadata at the beginning, essential for streaming so playback starts immediately.\n- Output as .m4a, a common audio-only container for streaming.\n\nAssumption: The input file is stereo and 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate, which are standard for music.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i concert_audio.wav -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart concert_audio_optimized.m4a\n```\n\nThis command will produce a much smaller file, optimized for streaming with minimal loss in perceived quality.",
