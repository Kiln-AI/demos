    "output": "To overlay hardcoded subtitles from captions.srt onto training.mp4 but only for the section between 00:01:00 and 00:03:30, you can use the subtitles filter with the \"enable\" option to limit the subtitle rendering to that time range. The timestamps are in seconds, so 00:01:00 equals 60 seconds, and 00:03:30 equals 210 seconds.\n\nKey points:\n\n- `subtitles=captions.srt` loads and renders the subtitles.\n- `enable='between(t,60,210)'` makes the subtitles visible only during the specified time interval.\n- The output video will have hardcoded subtitles burned in.\n- If you want only the section where subtitles appear (i.e., trimming video to that segment), you can use `-ss` and `-to`, but here it seems you want the full video with subtitles visible only between those times.\n- Use `-c:a copy` to copy audio without re-encoding.\n\nHere is the command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i training.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=captions.srt:enable='between(t,60,210)'\" -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 output_hardsub.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n- `-vf \"subtitles=captions.srt:enable='between(t,60,210)'\"` overlays subtitles only during 1 to 3.5 minutes.\n- Video is re-encoded with libx264 codec for compatibility and quality control.\n- Audio is copied as-is.\n- `-preset medium` balances encoding speed and compression efficiency.\n- `-crf 23` is a good quality starting point.\n\nThis creates a hardcoded subtitles video with subtitles only appearing on screen during the requested segment.",
