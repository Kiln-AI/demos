    "output": "To re-time subtitles during burn-in to correct for gradual video delay, you can use ffmpeg's `subtitles` filter with the `force_style` and `si` options to shift subtitle timestamps or use an external modified subtitles file.\n\nHowever, ffmpeg does not directly support gradual time shifting in subtitle filters. To apply a gradual delay correction, you usually need to preprocess the subtitles externally (e.g., using a script to modify subtitle timestamps with a linear time correction).\n\nAlternatively, for a gradual shift correction, you can use the `ass` filter combined with ffmpeg's `setpts` filter as a workaround by adjusting the subtitle rendering timestamps.\n\nA practical approach is:\n\n1. Use an external tool or script to re-time subtitles (e.g., using `ffsubsync` or subtitle editing software that supports timing curves).\n2. Then burn the re-timed subtitles into the video with ffmpeg.\n\nIf you want to do it entirely in ffmpeg, you can use the `ass` filter with `modify.ssa` subtitle files but to implement gradual delay, you would need to edit the .ass file timing manually.\n\nHere's an example command for burning subtitles after external re-timing:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"ass=retimed_subtitles.ass\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output_burned.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to shift subtitles timing by a fixed delay (not gradual), ffmpeg supports `subtitles` filter with `si` option like `si=1000` to delay 1000 ms (but this is constant, not gradual).\n\n---\n\nSummary:\n\n- For gradual delay correction: first preprocess subtitles timing externally.\n- Then burn them in using `ass` filter.\n\nAssumptions:\n\n- The input video is input.mp4, subtitles are in ASS format.\n- Gradual delay correction is not natively supported in ffmpeg filters; external processing is recommended.\n\n---\n\nExample preprocessing with `ffsubsync` (external tool):\n\n```bash\nffsubsync original_subs.srt -i input.mp4 -o retimed_subs.ass --linear-syncronizer \"start=0:0, end=duration:desired_shift\"\n```\n\nAfter you get `retimed_subs.ass`, burn subtitles:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"ass=retimed_subs.ass\" -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a copy output_burned.mp4\n```\n\nThis is the best practice approach for gradual subtitle re-timing with burning.",
