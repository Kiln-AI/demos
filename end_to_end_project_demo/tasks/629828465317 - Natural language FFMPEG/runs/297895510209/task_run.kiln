    "output": "Yes, you can remux (stream copy) the video stream from a DVD VOB file to an MP4 container without re-encoding by using the `-c:v copy` parameter. This tells ffmpeg to copy the video codec bitstream directly. However, you must ensure the video codec inside the VOB is compatible with MP4 containers. DVDs typically use MPEG-2 video, which is not supported in MP4 containers. Thus, copying MPEG-2 video directly into MP4 will not work properly.\n\nIf your source VOB contains H.264 video (rare for DVDs but possible for some ripped/authoring scenarios), you can stream copy into MP4 without encoding. Otherwise, you usually need to re-encode the video or remux to a container supporting MPEG-2 (like MPEG-TS or MPG).\n\nAssuming your VOB has H.264 video you want to copy and the audio you want to copy as well, here is an example command:\n\n- `-c:v copy` copies the video stream without encoding.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio streams without encoding.\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes MP4 for streaming.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.vob -c:v copy -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf your VOBâ€™s video codec is MPEG-2, the safe workflow to keep the streams without re-encoding is usually remuxing into an MPEG-TS container:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.vob -c:v copy -c:a copy output.ts\n```\n\nSo, in summary:\n- Directly copying MPEG-2 video into MP4 is not compatible.\n- If the video stream is already compatible (e.g., H.264), you can copy as shown.\n- Otherwise, consider remuxing to MPEG-TS or re-encoding to H.264 for MP4.\n\nIf you provide details of the exact codec in your VOB, I can tailor the command.",
