    "output": "To merge and sort subtitles from two SRT files by their start time before embedding them into a video, you need to first combine the subtitle files into a single sorted SRT file because ffmpeg itself does not provide direct subtitle merging and sorting capabilities. This is typically done with external tools or scripts. Once merged and sorted, you can embed the unified subtitle file into the video.\n\n### Step 1: Merge and sort the subtitle files\nHere is an example using a simple Python script or subtitle tool to merge and sort two SRT files:\n\n- Parse both SRT files.\n- Combine subtitle entries.\n- Sort them by start time.\n- Write to a new SRT file.\n\nIf you want a quick command-line solution with `ffmpeg`, it wonâ€™t fully sort subtitles from two separate files, so an external approach is recommended.\n\n### Step 2: Embed the merged sorted subtitle file into the video\nAssuming the merged and sorted subtitles are saved as `merged_sorted.srt`, embed them into the video as a subtitle stream or burn them into the video.\n\nExample using subtitle stream embedding (soft subtitles):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -i merged_sorted.srt -c copy -c:s mov_text output_with_subs.mp4\n```\n\n- `-c copy` copies video and audio streams without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s mov_text` converts subtitles to mp4-compatible text subtitles.\n- This embeds subtitles as a selectable track.\n\nExample burning subtitles into video (hard subtitles):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=merged_sorted.srt\" -c:a copy output_burned_subs.mp4\n```\n\n- `-vf subtitles=merged_sorted.srt` renders subtitles onto the video frames.\n- `-c:a copy` copies audio without re-encoding.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n1. Use a tool or script to merge and sort subtitles from both SRT files by start time, creating `merged_sorted.srt`.\n2. Embed the merged subtitle file into your video, either as soft subtitles or hardcoded.\n\nIf you want, I can provide you with a Python example to merge and sort two SRT files. Would you like that?",
