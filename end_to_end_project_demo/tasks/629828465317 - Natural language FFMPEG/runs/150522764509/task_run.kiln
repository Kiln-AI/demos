    "output": "To extract a single frame from your video at exactly the 1-minute (00:01:00) mark, you can use the -ss option to seek to the timestamp before decoding, and -vframes 1 to output only one frame. This will save the extracted frame as a PNG image (for best quality and wide compatibility).\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -i capture.mkv -vframes 1 -q:v 2 frame_at_1min.png\n```\n\nExplanation of parameters:\n- -ss 00:01:00 seeks to the 1 minute mark. Placing it before -i is fast but may land near the nearest keyframe; for exact frame accuracy, place it after -i, but it may take longer to process.\n- -vframes 1 tells ffmpeg to output just one video frame.\n- -q:v 2 uses high quality for JPEG/PNG output (lower values mean better quality; for PNG this is ignored, but is best practice for image extraction).\n- frame_at_1min.png is the resulting filename; you can use another format (like .jpg) if you prefer.\n\nAssumption: You want the best quality image, so PNG is chosen. If youâ€™d like another format, change the output filename accordingly.",
