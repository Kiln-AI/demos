    "output": "Sony AVCHD (.mts) files typically use the H.264 codec in an MPEG-TS or M2TS container, which is good quality but often not web-optimized due to large file size and container compatibility. To re-encode for browser playback with a reasonable file size, the best practice is to:\n\n- Convert to MP4 container for compatibility.\n- Use H.264 video codec with a balanced CRF setting for quality/file size trade-off.\n- Use AAC audio codec for broad browser support.\n- Set pixel format to yuv420p for maximum compatibility.\n- Use the `-movflags +faststart` flag to enable progressive streaming (placing the moov atom at the start).\n- Optionally resize the video if you want to reduce resolution and save more space.\n\nAssuming you want to keep the original resolution but optimize the compression, hereâ€™s a command using CRF 23 (good balance) and preset `medium` (balanced encoding speed and quality). You can adjust CRF between 18 (high quality, big files) and 28 (lower quality, smaller files) as needed.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mts -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nIf you want to reduce resolution (e.g., to 1080p or 720p for smaller files), add a scale filter, for example for 1080p with aspect ratio preserved:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mts -vf scale=-2:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart output.mp4\n```\n\nThis approach offers excellent browser compatibility with reasonable file size.",
