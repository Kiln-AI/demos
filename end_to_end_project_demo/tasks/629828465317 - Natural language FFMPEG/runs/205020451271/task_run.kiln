    "output": "To convert only the main audio track to AC3 while keeping the other audio tracks unchanged, you need to:\n\n- Map all streams explicitly to keep video and subtitle streams unchanged.\n- Re-encode only the first audio track to AC3.\n- Copy all other audio and subtitle streams as is.\n\nAssuming the \"main\" audio track is the first audio stream (audio stream 0:1), the command uses:\n\n- `-map 0` to include all streams.\n- `-c:v copy` to keep video streams untouched.\n- `-c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k` to re-encode only the first audio stream to AC3 at 640 kbps bitrate.\n- `-c:a:1 copy` (and so on) to copy remaining audio streams without re-encoding.\n- `-c:s copy` to copy subtitles if present.\n\nIf there are more than two audio streams, you should repeat `-c:a:N copy` for each additional audio track after `-c:a:0 ac3`.\n\nHere's an example command assuming 3 audio tracks (adjust accordingly if you have a different number):\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mkv -map 0 -c:v copy -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -c:a:1 copy -c:a:2 copy -c:s copy output.mkv\n```\n\nIf you do not know the exact number of audio streams, you can first run `ffmpeg -i input.mkv` to check the stream counts.\n\nThis approach ensures only the main audio track is transformed to AC3, while all other streams remain untouched.",
