    "output": "To convert multiple .avi files to .mp4 while preserving their aspect ratios, you can use a loop in your shell environment (e.g., bash). The key points are:\n\n- Use `-vf scale=-2:720` or adjust the scale filter to maintain the aspect ratio by only specifying one dimension (width or height), letting ffmpeg calculate the other. Here, for example, setting width to -2 allows height to be auto-calculated based on the original aspect ratio and ensures the width is divisible by 2 (a requirement for many encoders). Adjust if you want to fix height or width.\n- Use H.264 video codec (`libx264`) and AAC audio codec (`aac`) for wide compatibility.\n- Use `-movflags +faststart` to enable MP4 files to start playback before the entire file is downloaded.\n- Use a suitable quality setting (`-crf` for quality; lower means better).\n- The loop processes each `.avi` file found and writes an `.mp4` with the same basename.\n\nHereâ€™s an example bash loop to convert all `.avi` files in the current directory to `.mp4`:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.avi; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -vf \"scale=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:trunc(oh/2)*2\" -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart \"${f%.avi}.mp4\"\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation of scale filter used here:  \n`scale=trunc(oh*a/2)*2:trunc(oh/2)*2` dynamically calculates width and height based on original height (`oh`) and aspect ratio (`a` = input width/input height), ensuring both dimensions are divisible by 2, which complies with encoder requirements and preserves aspect ratio.\n\nAssumptions:  \n- You want to keep roughly the original resolution; the example scales width and height dynamically.  \n- You have bash shell or similar environment.  \n- Audio quality at 128 kbps and video quality at CRF 23 is acceptable.\n\nYou can adjust the scale filter to fix either width or height if desired, e.g., `scale=-2:720` for fixed height of 720 pixels and proportional width.",
