    "output": "To find all .avi files recursively, convert each to mp4 and then delete the original .avi files, you can use a combination of find, ffmpeg, and rm commands. However, since you want a command that deletes files, which is destructive, here's a command that performs this, but be very careful as it will remove original files permanently.\n\n```bash\nfind /path/to/search -type f -name \"*.avi\" -exec sh -c '\n  for f; do\n    ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p \"${f%.avi}.mp4\" && rm -f \"$f\"\n  done\n' sh {} +\n```\n\nThis finds all avi files, converts them to mp4 with decent quality settings, and deletes the original avi file after successful conversion.\n\nNote: Replace `/path/to/search` with the directory you want to search. Also, deleting files is irreversible; make sure you have backups or are certain before running.",
