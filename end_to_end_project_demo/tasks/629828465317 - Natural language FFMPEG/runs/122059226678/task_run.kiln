    "output": "For corrupt AVI files that play but cannot be opened by editors, a common approach is to re-mux or re-encode the file to a more robust container or fix the indexing. Re-muxing can often fix container-level corruption by rewriting headers and indices without re-encoding, which preserves quality and is fast. If that doesn't work, re-encoding with error resilience is the fallback.\n\nHere are two approaches with ffmpeg:\n\n1. **Re-muxing to a new AVI or MP4**  \nThis copies the streams without re-encoding, which is quick and lossless. This often fixes container corruption or indexing issues.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c copy fixed_output.avi\n```\nOr remux into an MP4 container, which might be more resilient:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c copy -movflags +faststart fixed_output.mp4\n```\n\n- `-err_detect ignore_err` tells ffmpeg to be lenient with decoding errors.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n- `-movflags +faststart` optimizes MP4 files for streaming.\n\n2. **If re-muxing fails, re-encode with error resilience**  \nThis re-encodes video and audio, repairing issues at the cost of quality and encoding time:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k fixed_output.mp4\n```\n\n- `libx264` re-encodes video to H.264.\n- `-preset fast` balances encoding speed and efficiency.\n- `-crf 23` is a good default quality level.\n- Audio is encoded to AAC.\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- The corruption is minor and ffmpeg can decode the input enough to remux or re-encode.  \n- You want either AVI or MP4 for output. MP4 is recommended for compatibility and streaming.  \n\nStart with the first method since it's faster and lossless, then try re-encoding if necessary.\n\n```bash\n# Method 1: Remux to AVI\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c copy fixed_output.avi\n\n# Method 1 alternative: Remux to MP4\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c copy -movflags +faststart fixed_output.mp4\n\n# Method 2: Re-encode if remuxing fails\nffmpeg -err_detect ignore_err -i corrupt_input.avi -c:v libx264 -preset fast -crf 23 -c:a aac -b:a 128k fixed_output.mp4\n```",
