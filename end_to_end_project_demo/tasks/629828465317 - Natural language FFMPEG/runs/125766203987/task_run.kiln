    "output": "Yes, you can both burn in subtitles (hardcode them into the video frames) and include a selectable (soft) subtitle track in the output file. This requires two separate steps:\n\n1. **Burn in subtitles** by overlaying them on the video frames.\n2. **Include the subtitle file as an additional track** in the final video, so players can choose to show/hide them.\n\nAssuming:\n- `input.mp4` is your source video.\n- `subs.srt` is your subtitle file.\n- You want the output as an `.mp4` container.\n\nExample explanation and command:\n\n**Technique:**\n- -vf subtitles=subs.srt adds burned-in (hardcoded) subtitles.\n- -map 0 maps all streams from the input video.\n- -map 1 includes the subtitle file as an additional selectable track.\n- -c copy copies all original streams, but you must re-encode the video if burning subtitles.\n- -c:s mov_text encodes the soft subtitle in the MP4-compatible format.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf subtitles=subs.srt -i subs.srt -map 0:v -map 0:a? -map 1 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy -c:s mov_text output_with_both.mp4\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- This command burns the subtitles onto the video frames **and** adds the same SRT as a selectable subtitle track.\n- The output video stream is re-encoded (`-c:v libx264`) because burning subtitles prevents copying the video stream.\n- `-map 0:a?` includes audio if present, but doesn't error if not.\n- You can use another output extension (.mkv) if you want broader subtitle codec/container support.",
