    "output": "To batch decrease the volume by 3 dB of every audio file in a folder using ffmpeg, you typically use a shell script or command-line loop to process all audio files automatically.\n\nKey points:\n- The `volume` audio filter with `volume=-3dB` lowers the volume by 3 dB.\n- It's important to keep the output filenames distinct from the input to avoid overwriting original files.\n- For batch processing, a loop iterates through all files with a certain extension, e.g., `.mp3` or `.wav`.\n- This example assumes a Unix-like shell (Linux/macOS). For Windows, a batch script or PowerShell would be required.\n- Audio files are copied in the same format by specifying the output extension accordingly.\n- You can change `*.wav` to any other extension depending on your files.\n\nExample bash loop for `.wav` files in the current directory:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.wav; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -af \"volume=-3dB\" \"vol_down_$f\"\ndone\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-af \"volume=-3dB\"` applies a volume filter reducing volume by 3 dB.\n- Output files are prefixed with `vol_down_` to distinguish from originals.\n- Quoting `$f` handles filenames with spaces safely.\n\nIf your audio files are of mixed types or you want to process multiple extensions, you can extend or customize the loop accordingly. Ensure ffmpeg is installed and available in your PATH.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a robust solution that processes all audio files and maintains original format and quality, here is an enhanced example processing `.mp3` files with copying non-audio streams skipped:\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mp3; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -af \"volume=-3dB\" -c:v copy -c:a libmp3lame -q:a 2 \"vol_down_$f\"\ndone\n```\n\n- Here, video streams (if any) are copied unchanged (-c:v copy).\n- Audio is re-encoded using libmp3lame at a good quality (`-q:a 2`).\n- Modify to your codec and format as needed.\n\n---\n\nThese approaches illustrate best practices for batch volume adjustment of audio files with ffmpeg automation.\n\n```bash\n# Simple volume decrease batch for .wav files:\nfor f in *.wav; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -af \"volume=-3dB\" \"vol_down_$f\"\ndone\n```",
