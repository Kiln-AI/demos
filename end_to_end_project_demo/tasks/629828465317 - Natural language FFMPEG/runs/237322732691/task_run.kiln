    "output": "Yes, you can batch convert a folder of `.mkv` files to `.mp4` using stream copying, which means you are not re-encoding the streams but simply changing the container format. This is very fast and preserves original quality, but it works only if the audio and video streams in the MKV files are compatible with the MP4 container (commonly H.264 video and AAC audio).\n\nTo do this, you can use a shell loop (bash) that processes each `.mkv` file in the folder and remuxes it to `.mp4` with ffmpeg using the `-c copy` option.\n\nHere is an example command script for Unix-like systems (Linux/macOS):\n\n- `for f in *.mkv; do ... done` loops over all MKV files.\n- `-c copy` copies streams without re-encoding.\n- `-map 0` ensures all streams from the input are copied (including subtitles if compatible).\n- Output filename is generated by replacing `.mkv` with `.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nfor f in *.mkv; do\n  ffmpeg -i \"$f\" -c copy -map 0 \"${f%.mkv}.mp4\"\ndone\n```\n\nIf the MKV files contain streams incompatible with MP4 (e.g., subtitles in certain formats or codecs), those streams might cause errors or be omitted. In such cases, you may want to specify which streams to map or exclude certain streams.\n\n**Note:** Always test on a few files first to ensure compatibility and no data loss.\n\n---\n\nIf you want a Windows batch version, let me know!",
