    "output": "To hardcode subtitles into a video (known as \"burning in\" subtitles), you should use the subtitles filter in ffmpeg, which rasterizes the subtitles onto each frame. This guarantees perfect sync, as the text is displayed in the exact timing dictated by the subtitle file. Make sure your subtitle file (usually .srt) matches the video's timecode and is in UTF-8 encoding for maximum compatibility. If you notice encoding or sync issues, double-check the subtitle timestamps and encoding.\n\nAssuming your files are named input.mp4 and subs.srt, and you want to output as output.mp4:\n\n- The -vf \"subtitles=subs.srt\" filter overlays the subtitles onto the video.\n- Default encoding settings preserve quality and sync.\n- If you have special characters, you can specify the character encoding: subtitles=subs.srt:charenc=UTF-8.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subs.srt:charenc=UTF-8\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nIf subtitles are out of sync, always check that subs.srt matches the video's actual timing and framerate. If your subtitles are in a different format (such as .ass for styled subtitles), you can use the same filter by replacing the extension.",
