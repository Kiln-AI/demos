    "output": "When downsampling to 480p and aiming for maximum compatibility across various players, use the following best practices:\n\n- Rescale with `-vf scale=-2:480` to ensure the height is 480 pixels and width is automatically calculated to maintain aspect ratio.\n- Set the pixel format to `yuv420p` with `-pix_fmt yuv420p`, since older devices and players may not handle higher chroma subsampling like `yuv422p` or `yuv444p`.\n- Use `libx264` for H.264 encoding (widely supported), and set `-movflags +faststart` for better network streaming.\n- Optionally, use `-profile:v baseline` or `-profile:v main` for maximum compatibility, as some players dislike high and higher profiles.\n\nHere's the optimized command:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf scale=-2:480 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -profile:v baseline -pix_fmt yuv420p -movflags +faststart -c:a aac -b:a 128k output_480p.mp4\n```\n\n**Assumptions:**  \n- Input file is `input.mp4` (replace as needed).\n- You want both maximum compatibility and decent quality for general playback.\n- AAC is chosen for audio for widely supported playback.\n\nThis setup ensures your 480p video plays correctly on the widest range of devices and media players.",
