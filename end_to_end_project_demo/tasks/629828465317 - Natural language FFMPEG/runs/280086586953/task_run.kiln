    "output": "To burn subtitles only between the 10:00 and 20:00 time segment of a video, you can use the `subtitles` filter with the `enable` option specifying the time interval. This way, the subtitles are rendered only during that segment.\n\nKey points:\n- `subtitles=filename` loads the subtitle file (assumed external .srt or similar).\n- `enable='between(t,600,1200)'` applies the subtitles filter only between 600s (10 min) and 1200s (20 min).\n- The subtitles must be an external subtitle file (e.g., subs.srt).\n- The rest of the video remains unaffected by the subtitle filter outside the given time range.\n  \nExample assumes your subtitle file is named `subs.srt` and your input video is `input.mp4`.\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"subtitles=subs.srt:enable='between(t,600,1200)'\" -c:a copy output.mp4\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- `-vf` applies the video filter.\n- `subtitles=subs.srt` loads and burns in subtitles from `subs.srt`.\n- `enable='between(t,600,1200)'` activates subtitles only between seconds 600 and 1200.\n- `-c:a copy` copies the audio stream without re-encoding.\n- Output is `output.mp4` with burned-in subtitles only during the specified time segment.\n\nIf your subtitles are embedded in the input video as a subtitle stream, more complex filtering would be required, typically by extracting and converting them first, as ffmpeg's burn-in subtitles filter needs external subtitle files.",
