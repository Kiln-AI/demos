    "output": "To downscale your 4K MP4 file to 1080p while recompressing with H.264, you'll want to use ffmpeg with the following settings:\n\n- The video scaling filter (-vf scale=1920:1080) will set the resolution to exact 1080p.\n- -c:v libx264 selects the widely compatible and efficient H.264 video codec, which is commonly used for HD videos and supported by most devices and platforms.\n- -preset medium provides a good balance of encoding speed and compression efficiency. If you need faster encoding, use fast; for smaller files, use slower.\n- -crf 23 controls the output quality (lower means better but larger files). 23 is a commonly recommended default; adjust based on quality needs.\n- -c:a copy preserves your original audio stream.\n- -movflags +faststart rearranges the output for better streaming performance.\n\nAssuming your input is input4k.mp4:\n\n```bash\nffmpeg -i input4k.mp4 -vf scale=1920:1080 -c:v libx264 -preset medium -crf 23 -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output1080p.mp4\n```\n\nThis command produces a high-quality, streamable 1080p MP4 using the H.264 codec, which is ideal for sharing and broad compatibility.",
